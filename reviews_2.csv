Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,audience,"An absolute adrenalin rush.
Highly recommend.
One must wonder why the disparity in critic versus audience scores. This movie is a masterpiece of subtlety that rewatching brings fulfillment and joy to the heart. You are taken once again on tale of solitary moments cherished in time from proposal, trepidation, and Maleficent's undying love for Aurora. You feel her torment but realize with her the importance of understanding. One person's fear and prejudice forced two Kingdoms into a war neither one wanted. And you once again realize the sheer power Maleficent has at her command, even among her own kind, not just with respect to man. She is one not to be crossed and she made that clear. This movie is a wonderfully balanced journey of fear and bravery, pain and joy, and seeing peace rise from war. There is nothing Maleficent would not do for Aurora and that includes ... (no more spoilers)
Watch this movie. Appreciate the nuance. Then watch it again.
And when you read the critics reviews you will understand that they just don't get what fairy tales are all about.
Now go!"
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,audience,"With this sequel to the incredible 'Maleficent', Disney attempts to recapture the wonder of the first film, but unfortunately it does fall short. That isn't to discredit the story itself, but compared to the first film, we are left wanting more from Jolie's performance. The visuals are still beautiful just like the first, but the script does create some dragging scenes."
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,audience,"Esta película, SOBRABA. 
Con la primera estaba todo perfect y con un final cerrado.
Es segunda parte me ha parecido insulsa y aburrida. 
No me gusta la actuación de la rubita (se me olvidó el nombre), Angelina muy bien.
Pero la historia deja mucho que desear, para mi gusto tiene muchos huecos argumentales y esta pasando todo muy deprisa, al punto que la película no se disfruta para nada."
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,audience,Its a good film but not better than maleficent 1 but you would like it. Good as a fantasy film
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,audience,One of the worst movies I have ever seen
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,audience,"La película es increíble me a llegado al corazón como pocas y me toco asta la fibra sencible es una película increíble no hay otra palabra para describirla, increible"
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,audience,Decent sequel to the original movie. I liked the design of the kingdom and Angelina Jolie was great but the script and the antagonist were a bit weak. All in all a nice watch for the weekend.
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,audience,watchable and mostly fun but ruins the integrity of the characters

The dialogue is hopelessly trite and generic, maladroitly trying to balance predictable exposition with comic relief - from countless different sources.

'Disney's Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' is beautifully animated, but there are many dark moments and themes within the movie that overshadow the notion that this film is supposed to be for kids or younger audiences.

Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,critic,"
The Disney live-action fairy tale sequel that begs the question ""Is Angelina Jolie too popularly disliked now to play anything but beautiful villainesses?""
 "
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,critic,"
There's a lot of money on the screen, Angelina Jolie is once again really good in the film, the musical score is great, and some of the action sequences are cool. But the story this time around is even less investing than last time.

The sequel, however, is thankfully an improvement over the poorly-executed first movie, thanks to the more experienced director Joachim Rønning.

Mistress of Evil is simultaneously overdone and undercooked, with a lot of the customary mistakes of giant studio entertainment.

Maleficent 2 is weirdly memorable with strange visual choices, great costumes, and two true movie stars giving each other the stink eye.
 "
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,critic,"
... a feast for the senses and the mind in terms of pure fantasy and imagination... buries significant character opportunities, as if the writers were tasked to combine three different scripts that defied being strung together.
 "
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,critic,"
Mistress of Evil could have done anything it wanted with its unconventional villain. And yet, for some reason, Disney chose to clip her wings - keeping her story from ever taking flight.
 "
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,critic,"
The moment they put two men on Mistress of Evil's screenplay was the moment it was doomed.
 "
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,critic,"
Jolie is the macabre somnolent beauty, practically sleepwalking through a fable with excessively hard-hitting aims and regrettably banal execution.
 "
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,critic,"
As much as I hate to say it, if you love Maleficent and her story, stop at the 2014 film or even rewatch the classic Sleeping Beauty. This sequel doesn't do the character or the Disney legacy justice.
 "
Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,39,95,critic,"
Truth is, if Disney had a little more guts, they would have made this a trilogy, and given it the care that other major fantasy epics receive.

El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,audience,Just the perfect conclusion to Jesses story.
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,audience,"Enjoyable but unnecessary add on to the ""Breaking Bad"" series, giving a full resolution to Jesse's character, even if its not needed.  Aaron Paul continues his brilliant turn as Jesse Pinkman, recovering from his imprisonment and torture while scrambling to finally escape to a new life.  The rest of the cast is equally brilliant, with many returning characters (a standout is Jesse Plemmons, who in a flashback shows just how much of a sociapath Todd was).  Behind the camera, Vince Gilligan writes and directs a solid movie that gives nice footnote on his classic series.  While it does answers fans questions about what really happened to Jesse, along with some fun twists and turns along the way, it is ultimately not necessary.  Thankfully, it fits in perfectly with the series, so fans will no doubt still love.  Not needed, but a fun watch regardless."
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,audience,"I didn't think it was necessary, but I don't know how it would have been without its existence now. I love that it's about Jesse Pinkman redeeming himself and moving on. Might as well be called Fixing Good."
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,audience,"El Camino is a pretty decent continuation of Breaking Bad's series finale, but it unfortunately doesn't feel like anything more than that."
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,audience,"A film that was not a necessary follow up ""Breaking Bad"", ""El Camino"" just happens to work and is a wonderful homage to fans of the series as it properly gives the audience closure on the story of Jesse Pinkman.  Aaron Paul's return to the character was absolutely outstanding, one has to appreciate the difficulty of having to play different interpretations of the character in this film.  The return of Brian Cranston as Walter White, his flashback scene with Pinkman, was an emotional return to the early days of these two characters.  With everything that happened in the series we tend to forget how utterly despicable and evil the character of Todd Alquist was, thus forgetting how brilliantly Jesse Plemons portrayed the character.  Finally, credit has to go to series creator and now director Vince Gilligan for a satisfying conclusion to the series.  Even with a near perfect film I had just one single complaint, that is that the film will primarily be for those who have taken the time to see ""Breaking Bad"".  Watching the growth of the character from the beginning of ""Breaking Bad"" up to ""El Camino"" is essential to grasp the pain and suffering Pinkman had gone through, it is understandable to be confused if you do not know anything about this character.  If that is the case, go back and watch ""Breaking Bad"".  Afterward, come back and watch this masterpiece."
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,audience,"Don't hit play expecting this film to outperform one of the greatest TV series ever produced. If you hit play expecting great acting from Aaron Paul and a movie from Gilligan as a director, you won't be disappointed."
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,audience,"Did anybody need this movie? No - we could have assumed all of this happens after Jesse (spoiler alert) escapes the compound at the end of the masterful series. But Paul is brilliant as usual, and it's a must-see for any fan of the show."
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,audience,"this movie follows the end of the season 5 of Breaking Bad, everything that anyone who liked that show will love that movie, it is really great."
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,audience,It was great being back in the breaking bad world. Following Jessie throughout this movie with a lot of flashbacks. I was kind of expecting the same level as breaking bad but it isn't.  I enjoyed the movie but didn't love it.
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,audience,Jessie was always such a whiny character. Glad his arc is done with this movie.
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is a worthy edition in the Breaking Bad canon. It takes forward the story of a character who was the moral centre of the show - or at least one who passed for one - and completes his arc in a satisfying way.

Even if it didn't necessarily need to exist, Breaking Bad may end up being enhanced by this in ways nobody ever expected.

El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
Like slipping on a pair of worn and comfortable shoes, Vince Gilligan and Aaron Paul make a thrilling and confident return to the world they left behind six years ago.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
For those who loved the story and the characters of Breaking Bad, El Camino is not only an epilogue of the series but also a prequel to the last episode of the show.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
El Camino is a good 2-hour episode of Breaking Bad . It works perfectly as an epilogue (in every sense of the word) to Jesse's dramatic arc and at no point does it clash with the canon from which it emerges.[Full review in Spanish]
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
A solid if unnecessary epilogue showing fans what happened to Pinkman after we last saw him drive away to freedom after being saved by Walt's blaze of glory.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
While El Camino doesn't hurt Breaking Bad's legacy, it doesn't enhance it either. It does, however, fulfill its purpose as fan service -- as you get to see some familiar faces, some tense drama and some gorgeous visuals once again.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
I never thought we needed to return to this world or meet up with these characters again, but I'm sure glad that we did.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
Rather than offering new insights into Breaking Bad's excellent story, El Camino reinforces the show's best traits and proves to be a necessary epilogue.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
It was a fantastic way to say goodbye to the series and tie up the bigger loose ends. Beyond that, I don't think there's much value for any non-Breaking Bad fans to tune in.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
If you enjoyed the original series and respect Gilligan's commitment to giving Jesse a send off, you'll probably get a lot out of this extra two hours of screen time.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
Suspenseful, funny, emotional and endlessly surprising, El Camino reminds us why we love Breaking Bad.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
There's nothing about El Camino that is essential; while it won't tarnish your memories of the original series, it won't reframe or enhance them, either. It's a nice ride with some old friends. Sometimes, that's just enough.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
For fans of the show who know these characters, that's a welcome conclusion for a story we didn't even know we missed until Vince Gilligan showed it to us.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
It's really well shot, really well acted, and it's constantly engaging.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
It's fun to see these characters again and be back in this world, but ""Better Call Saul"" does exactly that in a substantive manner. El Camino is saddled with a hollow center.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
[T]he movie is a wonderful reunion with the tone and feel of the original series, and with that comes exciting stylistic choices, impressively structured storytelling, and brilliant character work.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"
Except for the enjoyable nostalgia that swells in the form of throwback cameos, Vince Gilligan probably should've left this one alone. This movie may have sounded good in theory, but turns out it's far more story than anybody needed or wanted.
 "
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,91,81,critic,"

Judy,81,85,audience,Zellweger's performance leaves you stunned and applauding in this intriguing yet depressing film.
Judy,81,85,audience,"It's the same old biopic you've seen before, where a superb lead performance overcomes a middling script and a lack of innovation. Above-average direction, cinematography, and production values do make this more enjoyable than most however."
Judy,81,85,audience,"Interestingly enough, I have seen lately not one, but two movie portrayals of Louis B. Mayer – by Arliss Howard in „Mank"" and by Richard Cordery in „Judy"". Both of them were miles apart, and it was fascinating to watch, because those were two vision of the same man, but seen from two other perspective. After all, Mankiewicz was a well established screenwriter when Judy Garland was just a young girl, stands to reason then that they looked at mister Mayer from two different perspectives. And ""Judy"" is all about perspectives, or, more precisely, about one perspective – that of older, far less naive Judy Garland. It is a very intimate picture, quite dissimilar to the kind of biopic that is represented by, let say, ""Mank"". It also focuses on but a short period form the life of titular characters, but where ""Man"" stresses story and musters style, ""Judy"" focuses nearly purely on emotion – chaotic, unclear emotions of very troubled has-been star. And what it does, it does with skill. My one and only big problem with this movie is that its ""Over the Rainbow"", one thing that we all waited for, did not hit as strongly as intended. It felt rushed, to be honest, and somewhat artificial. Great scene on paper, but in practise something did not go as it should. And so I expressed my opinion without even once mentioning Renée Zellweger and her great skill..."
Judy,81,85,audience,"First of all, the large variance in volume levels in this movie was really annoying. The costume design, hair, and makeup were impressive, but the movie was a bit slow."
Judy,81,85,audience,"Renee Zellweger is amazing in this!

I'm not a huge Renee Zellweger fan, but I don't mean that in a disparaging way either. She's talented for sure. I just mean that I don't specifically seek out RZ movies as fan or anything. If you tell me that she's the lead, I feel neutral. 

After seeing this, I think I'm a fan, because she blew me away. Whenever really famous actors play really famous real-life figures, I usually find it distracting. It's even worse if they go so far as to wear facial prosthetics or fake teeth or something. That's just a distraction. Renee didn't have any special effects makeup. She just embodied Judy Garland in her body language, expressions, onstage personality, and spirit. Bravo!"
Judy,81,85,audience,"Based on the 2005 musical stage drama ""End of the Rainbow"", ""Judy"" chronicles the last months in the life of legendary entertainer Judy Garland.  Renée Zellweger plays Garland and does a good job in the role (She won her second Academy Award for this performance.).  She does make a strong effort to deliver a good performance and I would say she succeeded.  My problem with the movie is not her performance, but the formulaic nature of the script.  Though I understand many of the events portrayed on film are true, it seemed contrived.  Very similar to my criticism of ""Bombshell"".  Yes, it is true Judy Garland did not want to take the gig at Talk of the Town in London, but was forced to because she was broke and no opportunities were available to her in the US due to her addiction to alcohol and prescription pills which reportedly made her difficult to work with, and yes there were performances at Talk of the Town that went very well and others that were disastrous (The scene where audience members threw dinner rolls at her actually happened.).  Still, the story felt very predictable.  Then at the end we get the final scene where she finally sings ""Over the Rainbow"" and that is seen as her last triumph.  That scene (which was fiction) screamed contrivance.  What does help the movie are the flashback sequences of Judy on the set of ""The Wizard of Oz"" getting harshly criticised by Louis Mayer.  They are very compelling.  What is even more so are the flashback scenes were she was treated horribly as a teenager.  Those scenes were much more interesting and probably would have made a better movie.  In the end, ""Judy"" is a good movie, but it could have been better.  It is worth seeing at least once I would say."
Judy,81,85,audience,"Il film come prevedibile gira tutto intorno alla performance di Renee Zellweger; che offre una prestazione incredibile, in ogni movenza ed in ogni dettaglio.
Gli altri personaggi che le girano intorno sono piatti e poco interessanti."
Judy,81,85,audience,"Renee Zellwegger's real forte is playing a heartbroken character who makes us laugh and cry at the same time, a la ""Cold Mountain,"" but ""Judy"" strips away such rich complexities. Zellwegger's solid, but the part she plays is a sad, sad Judy Garland, naked in the nausea of her despair. Far from inspiring a sense of compassion, ""Judy"" might just leave you nauseous."
Judy,81,85,audience,"Judy is a reliable portray of what was Judy Garland's life, but that is it. Renee Zellweger performance wasn't worthy of an Oscar Nomination. I didn't find the story pertinent at all and I just wanted the movie to end or I might have died of boredom. The song's performances were not close to be on point as the original ones."
Judy,81,85,audience,"Judy is an emotionally powerful biopic shining light onto one of history's most iconic actresses. At first glance, Judy seems to be an okay film on the surface, but if you take a closer look you'll discover how much harder these themes and ideas hit."
Judy,81,85,critic,"
Judy does a fantastic job at exploring the person and star Judy Garland was, as well as who she wished she could have been had life turned out different.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
In the end, Judy is, to a large degree, an effort at impersonation to which certain relatively simplistic criticisms of the film industry are attached.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
I don't think it was the intention of the makers of Judy for us not to see her as a real, layered person, but this is the result.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
Bringing the story to vivid life is Zellweger in a career best performance. She looks and sounds enough like Garland to be convincing, but this isn't just mimicry.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
Garland's life is so inherently emotional and Zellweger's performance is so appreciably raw, that Judy manages to wring pathos by the end.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
Renee Zellweger does more than just an impression of Judy Garland, inhabiting her joys and failures with equal passion.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
The movie's spotlight is where it should be: on Zellweger's Judy. Brilliant at conveying both the star's vulnerability and her still radiant charisma, she is simply sensational
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
With Judy, Renee Zellweger has found a perfect fusion of actor and character.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
Zellweger finds the tragedy of Garland's life in odd moments-staring at a pretty slice of cake she is afraid to eat, turning the plate around.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
Zellweger's film from beginning to end.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
In an attempt to shower Garland with the empathy and compassion she so clearly lacked (and deserved) while alive, the film ends up over-protecting her.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
It follows a fairly standard music biopic formula, the same that saw Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody smash the box office, but it's Zellweger who elevates Judy.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
What I see doesn't move me, after half an hour everything becomes hopelessly conventional with the sole purpose of appreciating Renée Zellweger's great acting skills. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
This is emphatically a movie about Renée Zellweger playing Judy Garland, reclaiming the mantle of 'serious actor' that marked her for greatness nearly two decades ago...To which I can only add: Mission Accomplished.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
Don't expect a comprehensive biopic. This film follows the tragic twilight of Garland's career. Rather than a star is born, it's a star burns out, so get your hankies ready.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
There is nothing about this film that is particularly memorable (other than the opening + closing scenes for ALL the wrong reasons). This biopic is poorly-written and Gambon and Buckley are unfortunately wasted. Ultimately this is The Renee Show.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
Zellweger demonstrates her thorough grasp of the qualities that allowed Judy to be not only one of the greatest entertainers of the 20th Century, but also a very special icon and even guardian angel to millions of gay men worldwide.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
Zellweger herself ascends to greatness. This is a performance that should be remembered come Oscar time.
 "
Judy,81,85,critic,"
Just go along for the ride.

Quite a lovely portrait.

Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,67,88,audience,"This movie is the worst thing I've ever seen, what the actual fuck why the fuck was there 70 machine guns vs the rock in a skirt"
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,67,88,audience,"What a heaping load of shit. Overlong scenes of pointless, repetitive homoerotic dialogue, gaping plot holes and action so over the top that it ceases to be fun or interesting."
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,67,88,audience,"I'll start out by saying that I am not a fan of the FAST & FURIOUS franchise, but since this was a spin-off and it features both Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, I took a flier on it. Statham and Johnson work well together, feeding off of each other in every scene and their banter is very enjoyable. The jokes are hit and miss though. Idris Elba did a nice job as the baddie and while the special effects were good, some of the action was over the top (I know, for spin-off of the FAST & FURIOUS franchise, surprise, right?). Some of it I didn't mind but some of it I thought took away from the movie honestly (see the final showdown between our heroes and the villain). A few good chase and fight scenes make this an enjoyable summer popcorn flick."
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,67,88,audience,"Though it is obvious that this movie's sole purpose is to remove Hobbs from the main franchise due to the Rock's conflict with Vin Diesel, I felt like this movie did a lot better than some other F&F films at character development. Even so, it still somehow felt like an F&F movie."
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,67,88,audience,"this is the first Spinoff in the Fast & Furious Franchise that does not disappoint. the action, as always, is entertaining, Idris Elba and Vanessa Kirby is a nice addition and a strong story. it's also incredible funny and I love the Cameos with Reynolds and Hart."
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,67,88,audience,"Pathetic movie. It does not fit into the F&F genre at all. No story line, just the Rock trying to show off like a teenage jock."
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,67,88,audience,"A thrill ride of a movie, whether or not it exists so The Rock doesn’t have to share the screen with Vin Diesel."
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,67,88,audience,"Hobbs and Shaw is in no way a great movie but its got so much action,  so many jokes, and is just so out there of an idea that its kinda hard for me to hate. I was pleasantly surprised. Sure it plays out like a video game plot but it also exceeded my expectations in alot of ways. The cast is really likable, even the villain. It was worth the watch."
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,67,88,audience,Wonderful movie I enjoyed watching
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,67,88,audience,"Coming from a movie goer who is not really into the Fast and Furious movies and does not hold any other emotions in regards to watching this movie, I personally believed that the film did an excellent job in keeping the audience entertained with a mashup of comedy and action between the dynamite duo of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Stathman. Hobbs and Shaw combined a lot of different elements to create a pure action film that definitely passed the time. Though not a follower of the series, I did enjoy this film and surely come back hungry for more."

Whether Hobbs & Shaw is the dumbest movie ever made is a topic for debate, but it's in the running. Sometimes that's dumb in a fun, goofy way, but more often, it's tedious, exhausting, and a test of patience.

It takes away what is essential and adds what is unnecessary, while being entirely unneeded in and of itself.
The animation, or at least character models, while impressive, and UNexpressive and emotionless, rendering any emotional scene as absolutely hilarious while these blank-eyes zombie lions stare off vaguely in any given direction in order to attempt to relay SOME kind of feeling, but you could pretty much take away the eyes, noses and mouths, IE the faces, and get the exact same response.

It's laughable how empty this movie is.
It clearly exists as nothing but a tech-demo, a way of John Favreau to show you his cool new toy, and nothing else, otherwhile more effort would have been put into making this serious, emotional story...Well, serious and emotional.
At it's best, it's stupidly hysterical, at worst, it's The Lion King 2019."
The Lion King,52,88,audience,The funniest live-action remake!!!!!!!!!!!
The Lion King,52,88,audience,"This movie applies from the cartoon version, represent through live-action. For me, as a Disney lover, I am extremely infatuated with this version because the content is as same as the cartoon version and they make lions very powerful and baby Simba very touch my heart. Also, attacks my heart, the scene that Mufasa (Simba's dad) dead and Simba comes to see his dad. It makes my tears. For Scar (Simba's uncle) the script, personality, facial expression very represents the villain. Even, the Hyenas (underling of Scar) also represents the villain.
	This version shows everything about the cartoon version. Included the romance scene that Simba and Nara (Simba's crush) met each other again. They represent the cuteness and love that they show to each other. This scene I highly recommend you to watch it because the mood and tone are very beautiful also the music that plays it very emotional. Another scene that I think is very impactful is the scene that Scar rules the kingdom and the land is dried, the kingdom lack abundance, the tree is dead, Scar hunting every day, and too much. I also like this scene because their 4g can show the lacking and make the kingdom not livable. But nobody can offend.	
Another scene that I think shows the power is Simba's fight with Scar. Before having this scene, Simba decided to come back and protect his kingdom but the biggest problem is Scar. So, they get the fight that I have said this scene shows the power because it is fierce fight and vehement in combination with the effect of fire behind the fight it makes the fight more impassioned.	
However, for this version, I did not see the rule of Rafiki (monkey that carries Simba at the beginning), in this version it just came out a few scenes. In my point of view, in the cartoon version, the rule of Rafiki is more showed. Anyway, I truly love this version and I also recommend for those who are Disney or Lion King fan. This movie both kids and adults can watch it!"
The Lion King,52,88,audience,"In the same vein as the other Disney adaptations. If you liked any of them or the animated version of this, you're going to like the movie. I'm really happy they got James Earl Jones back to voice Mufasa but was disappointed they didn't get Jeremy Irons back for Scar (his menacing voice was definitely missing and no offense to Chiwetel Ejiofor, but I just felt his version of Scar wasn't evil enough for this villain). My favorite characters/actors were either John Oliver as Zazu or Seth Rogen as Pumbaa. And as always, the CGI and special FX are top notch. They did a really wonderful job bringing these characters to life!"
The Lion King,52,88,audience,"The movie looks great, but performance is bad."
The Lion King,52,88,audience,"Disney gives us a beautifully animated remake of their already perfected original 'The Lion King'. The animation just revamps the original even more on its own, but the incredible and diverse cast take the extra step that is needed. The soundtrack is nostalgic and brings back all of the excitement of the original. Even though it is an exact copy of the original, it is so beautiful and the behind the scenes changes were enough to make the film still enjoyable."
The Lion King,52,88,audience,"I was going to the cinema without any expectations, I sat down and I didn't feel the time passing"
The Lion King,52,88,audience,I love this more than the original.
The Lion King,52,88,audience,"this is gorgeously animated with still excellent music but it just is a longer, more dragged out version of the original."
The Lion King,52,88,audience,They ruined a classic. Such a shame.
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
Certain elements of the new version of The Lion King could have worked better, but the filmmakers went above and beyond in creating an immersive world for the characters to exist, and the classic story has never looked better.

The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
A stunning technical achievement that feels like a risk-free exercise in nostalgia that will entertain your eye but likely won't engage your heart.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
If you've been waiting for a beat-for-beat remake since Disney started this whole ""reimagining"" thing, then no worries! This movie ticks all the boxes.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
To its credit, it's frequently difficult to tell when the animals - and especially the backgrounds and environments - aren't actual photography (and none of it is).
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
The 'Lion King' is engaging, cinematically beautiful, and showcases some of the rich cultural traditions of Africa. Though at times, the CGI was a little distracting.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
By working so hard to make it look like a National Geographic film with all the genitals removed, Jon Favreau and his team have created something that, while it is kinda cool to look at, is soulless
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
While the remake does result in being an admirable visual-effects experiment, it still plays things too safe in terms of story structure.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
Can you feel the love tonight? Um, no. Actually I can't.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
A beat for beat remake may prove enough from some, but there's no denying that this is simply a less compelling, emotionally vacant re-hash of a story that has been delivered with so much more imagination in the past.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
The Lion King boxes itself in a corner, trapped by the constraints of its realistic and over-indulgent animation in a forgettable, shallow exercise that solely relies on our nostalgia as if that was enough to give it a free pass.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
This version of The Lion King is so in love with its own visual splendour that it forgets it's supposed to be telling a story.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
Bizarrely, even those beautiful backdrops are fake. Literally everything you see is created on a computer screen, which makes you wonder why they bothered aiming for as seemingly real as possible.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
It's an uninteresting animated film, devoid of charm and sensitivity. It looks like a dull Animal Planet documentary. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
Disney's two-hour revival of an 88-minute classic has its moments that work as a technical demo. But in case it wasn't clear already: Tech demos are not finished movies.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
A blockbuster that is visually mind-blowing in its photorealistic nature, yet feels oddly soulless compared to the original.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
he Lion King is undeniably impressive. But the film's showy quality stays glued to the surface and never soars high enough to be able to keep up with the crescendo of Mufasa and his successor Simba's roar.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
So, is this film good enough to change our attitudes towards remakes? Not really. It's watchable but it barely tugs the heartstrings of our childhood memories. Perhaps the younger generation might find some joy in it, as we did with the 1994 version.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
A line for line remake except it's longer, boring, and has acting similar to community theater.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
Unlike colorful animated films precisely made to attract young eyes, this film lacks that fundamental cartoonish magic that will make its young audience sit, watch, and take in the story.
 "
The Lion King,52,88,critic,"
Remember ... when Gus Van Sant ... tried an experiment where he did a shot-for-shot remake of Psycho? That's exactly what watching Favreau's The Lion King feels like.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,audience,Second best movie in Star Wars after Empire Strike Back.
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,audience,"A really good film. I was kind of skeptical when it came to the force awakens, I didn't know if disney just had one lucky thing up there sleeve, but then this came out and when I saw it as a 9 year old, I thought, that was really boring, but now I realize, it doesn't matter if it's entertaining, but as long as it has good world building, plot, dialouge and execution. I had a blast rewatching this. I first think I should talk about the problem most people have with it. That the characters aren't devoloped, but the thing is that it's not supposed to make you very well attacthed to the characters and its more of telling what really happened, from that one single opening title line in A new hope. The basic premis of this movie sounds great! And thanks to great directing and a good screenwriter, it made in my opinion, the best disney star wars movie. The actors do well with what they are given and have great timing, subtlety and display the faith in there characters. My biggest problem though with the movie, is that they make a lot of these characters and give the main character and her love interest a character, but not the rest which didn't make too much sense. There are times where I couldn't really follow through and the pacing could be a bit slow from time to time. I also didn't like how they put relationships in characters and gave some characters some personality and others not and just to throw it away really bothered me. Besides that, Rogue One is a star wars adventure that you dont want to miss."
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,audience,The best of the anthology films of Star Wars. The best part comes in the end with the entrance of Darth Vader. Brilliantly done
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,audience,"This is the first star wars moive i watch so far out of ""Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy"" from Family Guy.✔🥓"
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,audience,It's ok. Worth watching for the final scenes. But the story itself it's that well written. Things happen because the plot needs them to happen. The writing isn't there.
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,audience,"Lovet this movie, the bad guys are great and you feel for the good guys."
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,audience,"Easily the best Disney star wars movie, great story, good acting, a very well-written movie"

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
Rogue One isn't just the prequel you never knew you wanted, it's also quite possibly almost almost as good as A New Hope itself.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
A thrilling action movie superior to any of the prequels.

You might have no idea how big the Star Wars franchise really is and still be able to love this particular movie devoid of any expectations.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
There may be a lot of action, but it never loses sight of the father/daughter relationship at the heart of the story.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
Star Wars as a franchise is not perfect. But Rogue One gave us something different in its standalone approach. It reinforces the simple notion of hope and change and the true cost of conflict and war.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
Rogue One is exciting and action-packed...the type of stand-alone, peripheral Star Wars film [George Lucas] should've been making during the years between Jedi and the prequels, instead of continually tinkering with what we already had.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
It's indicative of where this franchise is going. Actually, let me correct that: it's indicative of where this franchise isn't going.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
In Rogue One, [Gareth] Edwards has made the most realistic of Star Wars than any before -- and with that, also the most mature and grown-up one.

It was real and it was bleak.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
I think the main reason I liked this movie so much is because the characters all seemed grounded and real.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
Boosted immeasurably by Michael Giacchino's rousing score, Rogue One moves at a breakneck pace and pulls us in with visuals that are both awe-inspiring and very much grounded in reality.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
The film is fun, it's enjoyable, it was exciting at times even, but something felt like it was missing or off.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
Rogue One is muscular blockbuster filmmaking that also has a heart and an ethical code.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
Unlike any other franchise, a new Star Wars movie can be considered a life event (I can pinpoint where I saw each one of the prequels and Episode VII). Make it a special one, the movie does its part.
 "
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,84,86,critic,"
Rogue One is a prequel done right, and it succeeds by focusing on the details.
 "

The visual splendor of Rogue One often gets ignored, but few images can haunt an audience like The Death Star coming up over the horizon.

Dark Phoenix,22,64,audience,"I am a huge X-Men fan and as varied as the movies have been, I've always found something to like in everyone of them - except this one.

Dark Phoenix is incredibly bland in every way. I never thought I'd say this but I strongly recommend watching X-Men The Last Stand over this. They basically cover the same story beats, except TLS will actually hold your attention. It's so unfortunate for this iconic franchise to end on this note."
Dark Phoenix,22,64,audience,I don't get all the critics' negativity on this one. Not the best but definitely not the worst X-Men. I enjoyed it.
Dark Phoenix,22,64,audience,"A mulligan from the 2006 version and while this was better, overall, it beats out APOCALYPSE but not FIRST CLASS or DAYS OF FUTURE PAST. The X-Men franchise started out well with the 2000 version and X2: X-MEN UNITED, and with the exception of the reboot FIRST CLASS, the franchise (outside of DEADPOOL and LOGAN) has not put out a quality product. I will miss some of the cast as I've always loved Michael Fassbender as Magneto and James McAvoy as Professor X, but I am glad to see Marvel finally with their property back and hope they wait a couple of years before rolling out their version, which I'm sure is the best we'll get and what fans have been waiting years to see!"
Dark Phoenix,22,64,audience,"There are no words in gods green earth that can describe how much I hate this movie, literally no effort was put into it"
Dark Phoenix,22,64,audience,"Worst X-men movie yet. 
Weak Plot, confusing power scale and fight scene with poor character development. I regret seeing it in cinema."
Dark Phoenix,22,64,audience,Top three in X-men movies. Not sure why people hated this. 
Dark Phoenix,22,64,audience,Not nearly as bad as critics made it appear. Liked it more than X-Men Apocalypse.
Dark Phoenix,22,64,audience,"Critics who shunned this movie are simply, plainly, ignorant about the original X-Men comic book story arc. Jean Grey dies at the end, and comic book fans in the know understood this. Critics who didn't called the ending ""disappointing,"" which is a little like someone saying the film ""Titanic"" was a letdown because the boat sank.

Go. See. This. Movie!"
Dark Phoenix,22,64,audience,"Horrível.
Só de pensar que gastei dinheiro para assistir isto dá-me vontade de me enfiar num carro e me atirar de uma rapina.
Ainda por cima o filme é longo, ao menos se o sofrimento não fosse tão demorado...
Um dos piores filmes dos X-Men e uma desilusão."
Dark Phoenix,22,64,audience,Just don't watch this Fuc**** garbage of a movie this is one Phoenix not rising from the ashes.
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
""Dark Phoenix"" feels rushed, as if Kinberg wanted to cram two, maybe three, movies into one while Disney was busy gobbling up the studio and all of its intellectual properties.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
If this is to be the final film in its current incarnation, it's an unfortunate end to characters that essentially started the movie superhero boom.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
Despite the pyro on display Dark Phoenix doesn't catch fire.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
The action sequences, though well done, aren't enough to shift the tides of this lukewarm superhero film bumbling in the dark for meaning, understanding, and, ultimately, closure.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
The music by Hans Zimmer is a huge improvement over the last several X-Men chapters.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
The X-Men franchise limps to a conclusion with this lifeless entry that finds director Simon Kinberg in over his head.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
The spectacle is entertaining, up to a point, but even the digital wizardry wears thin, and Dark Phoenix turns into a standard-brand miasma of explosions, collisions and swirling force fields.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
What could've been a poignant, epic conclusion to a lengthy franchise ends up being an unmemorable spectacle that's a quick payday for those involved.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
I'm fairly sure at some point I mumbled 'We get the point already!'

Close to non-existing action, it's incredible that at this point in the superhero genre, we still get floppy films like this one. [Full review in Spanish]

A dull snooze lacking spectacle, it does the unthinkable and makes 2006's much-maligned X-Men: The Last Stand look marginally better in retrospect.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
It's a dull superhero movie out of the bunch, a rushed product that never escapes the bland. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
All in all, the franchise has petered out with a film that is neither its best nor worst entry.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
It's too much story to tell in one chapter while also trying to wrap up two decades worth of material. The Phoenix storyline should have been built over the past few installments, rather than cramming it all here at the end.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
Dark Phoenix shows a franchise that has run out of gas.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
One or two entertaining moments, but there's nothing new left for this reboot.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
Overall, it's like X-Men knew it's a far third in terms of superhero franchises and just stopped trying with this movie.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
While this time around the filmmakers are able to flesh the tale out more and give it the attention it deserves, they still don't quite give it its due.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
It was boring.
 "
Dark Phoenix,22,64,critic,"
This movie was very inconsequential.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,audience,"The evil Superman. I really enjoyed this opposite end of the spectrum take on the tale of Superman. Crashing in Kansas from another world, Brandon Breyer, uses his powers not for good, but rather for bad intentions, once he realizes his potential and gets his first taste of killing. I typically don't like child/teenage actors as I find them annoying more often than not. However, Jackson A. Dunn who stars as Brandon, does a tremendous job with his characters arc from start to finish. This probably won't make much noise at the box office, but if you're in to horror or superhero films, I recommend this!"
Brightburn,58,67,audience,"Brightburn brings something fresh to the anti-hero type movie but just fails to seal the deal. Director James Gunn had a perfect opportunity to make something more gore and horror like but just missed it. Even if Brightburn is a fun watch, it felt like an appetizer and I was left craving for more. Finally, with an amazing cast and interesting characters the movie had potential, but just ended being an okay movie. It is good, but not great."
Brightburn,58,67,audience,A truly original take on the superman story premise that works suprisingly well for horror. The movie ultimately delivers on a lovecraftian vibe; the rational human being thrown towards an omnipotent force they cannot comprehend. It also offer some of the best gory scenes I've ever experienced in a horror movie; used sparingly to achieve maximum effect.
Brightburn,58,67,audience,"I thought this was a lot of fun. Obviously, there's not a whole lot to the story, but it's mainly about creating suspenseful and scary moments, and I think it succeeds in that. This movie is basically the nightmare Batman had about what Superman could become in BvS, and that's why I will always defend that Batman was justified in his actions in that movie."
Brightburn,58,67,audience,"I made an account just to leave this review after being so disappointed.
I appreciate a good revenge power fantasy and love me some Gunn schlock, but SPOILERS: this movie is about a kid killing ONLY the people who were nice to him. This isn't the revenge of the downtrodden in Joker or the twisted logic of Homelander in The Boys, it's just a kid who becomes angry and kills everyone close to him. While I understand the movie logic of him being an alien sleeper cell, as a movie narrative it was just frustrating and unappealing."
Brightburn,58,67,audience,"Really good premise, some good moments here and there. The action scenes did their job and so did the suspense. But oh so boring. The performances from the actors were functional but that is the best I can say about it. Boring movie overall. The content could have been told in 30 minutes and it would be better for it."
Brightburn,58,67,audience,So If I had to choice to die in the next 30 min or watch this movie I just killed myself right now =)))
Brightburn,58,67,audience,"Pretty good twist on the Superman franchise with a ""what if he were a bad guy"" twist. However, it could have been better. I think that the character choices and development were a little lacking, with some obvious issues ignored by characters"
Brightburn,58,67,audience,"I actually kept watching thinking it had to improve as Elizabeth Banks was in it. Desr Lord was I mistaken. If you enjoy seeing some tension build only to swoosh to a scene showing a flying sheet with some fake blood knowing its her kid under there killing all these people you've got it. There you have it. He can't be stopped.  Guess what he isn't stopped cause ""he can't be"" Thats it. Kid under a fake bloody sheet. Never give a review like this. Why did a company waste $$$ on something like this when you know there had to be better out there?? Still love Elizabeth Banks."
Brightburn,58,67,audience,"""Omen"" like film, except the kid is an alien instead of the son of Satan. I fast forwarded through most of it to the ending and even that was rather unsatisfying. Not worth watching."
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
This is not like any film I've seen before which I really liked. It had a great mix of... this weird new superhero sci-fi thing we're going through and then just brutal horror.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
While the story creates an interesting question of connection and adoption, it fails to be anything more than a set up for a sequel.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Jackson A. Dunn is undoubtedly the star of the show here, and a young actor that I'm incredibly impressed with.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Much of the credit for the ways in which the film does succeed goes to the sublimely cast Jackson A. Dunn.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Thanks to an impressive array of central performances and some memorable explosions of gore, it does limp across the finishing line with most of its goodwill in tact.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Brightburn is more of a horror film that may appeal to those who are looking for something different than the conventional superhero box despite the issues that pop up.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Brightburn is the ultimate superhero 'What if...?' scenario, taking things to the furthest extremes.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
A predictable yet entertaining, gleefully bloody exploration of evil finding its way in the world.

Maybe it has many issues, but Brightburn is exactly what horror fans ask for in this era of 'superhero infested multiplexes'. [Full review in Spanish].

Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
This is an interesting idea that I wish they had done more with.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Brightburn is an intelligently made thriller whose director, David Yarovesky, knows how to draw out dread with silence and turn it up to 11 only when necessary.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Full of gore, crazy deaths, and jump scares! Brightburn is absolutely brilliant. And that ending... a must watch for horror fans!
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Brightburn is an uninspired slasher that squanders a premise with great potential.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Brightburn is a satisfactory ""what if"" Superman origin tale with top-notch performances and a well-balanced mix of horror and drama.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Exactly the kind of cynical mash-up you'd expect from studio executives eager to make a quick payout.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
After such an exquisite set up, Brightburn's execution is a little bit disappointing, becoming a rather straightforward supernatural horror instead of delving deeper into superhero lore.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
The film has some very effective moments, some solid performances, a good idea, but an execution that does not live up to the idea.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Despite its simplicity, Brightburn's premise is filled with potential, but it struggles to find anything meaningful to say.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
The conceit works brilliantly until, in the closing 20 minutes, it clatters disappointingly into a fatal uncertainty.
 "
Brightburn,58,67,critic,"
Brightburn takes a cool premise and executes it in a blackly fun but nihilistic manner.

Aladdin,57,94,audience,"I admit that I was very afraid of this new version of Aladdin I didn't really know what the intention was, especially when someone like Guy Ritchie was called to direct but in the end I was surprised In a very positive way everything worked for the most part the interpretations to music and mainly the changes made and the update made in relation to the source material is not just a re-reading of Animation but something with its own personality that will surely mark new generations."
Aladdin,57,94,audience,"I mean, the original 92' animation was my favorite childhood movie, and I was a little concerned that Disney may have done a bad job with it. Truth is, despite all the little changes, the shortcomings in storytelling and a somewhat cartoonish representation of Jaffar I couldn't ignore the fact that I'd reached the last minute with a huge smile on my face. 

The setting is vibrant and colorful, the songs are fun to listen to and watch as they come to life, and god knows how happy I am that they didn't try to turn Abu into a more realistic version of himself like they did with the Lion King. It's different, but the magic is all there!"
Aladdin,57,94,audience,"Visually stunning, even if most of it is computer generated, unfortunately the performances from the cast are quite the opposite. Who would've guessed that Will Smith can't sing?  Not me!"
Aladdin,57,94,audience,"So much wrong with this movie- Will Smith as the genie (hip hop accent and awkward line delivery), forced feminist pieces, just so disjointed and culturally everywhere. I would not hire the director for another remake."
Aladdin,57,94,audience,"The live-action remake of Disney's hit film 'Aladdin' is a fresh and fun return to the wondrous world we experienced in the animated version. The remake does a wonderful job of staying loyal to the source material while also taking great steps to represent its female characters much better by giving Jasmine a better storyline and her own musical numbers. The visuals are stunning and the musical numbers are insanely well realized in live-action. Will Smith does great as his version of the Genie, which he ensures doesn't undercut the amazing performance from the late Robin Williams' version of the character."
Aladdin,57,94,audience,After suffering this torture we had to immediately watch the original Aladdin.
Aladdin,57,94,audience,I enjoyed this one as it was great to see another Disney classic brought to life by this cast and Will Smith to make it entertaining for the whole family to watch
Aladdin,57,94,audience,It reminds me of childhood.
Aladdin,57,94,audience,"The casting, musical sequences and added songs are incredible. The only let down is Jafar's casting - he unfortunately lacks humour and menace and therefore delivers a very bratty child like performance. But well worth a watch, or 7..."
Aladdin,57,94,audience,"I absolutely hate how audiences are duped with these remakes. It takes the original source material we love, sucks out its life and originality, and waters it down so far you cannot recognize it. Disney needs to stop making these remakes, or at least TRY to make it as good as the original."

A movie loaded with missed opportunities.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
It's unlikely that the new Aladdin will be the cultural touchstone that the original was, but it has plenty of memorable moments that complement well the iconic ones many of us hold near and dear.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
Still, as cynical and pointless an operation as this remake cycle has often been, Aladdin is a bit livelier than the equivalent Beauty and the Beast.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
Despite the updates and the pomp Aladdin feels underwhelming by the time the end credits roll. The songs frequently interrupt the flow of the story, creating a stop-and-go feel that sucks some of the film's momentum away.
 "

When the sand settles, Aladdin is more fun than needs fixing.
 "

The movie addresses the problematic aspects of the original to make it more modern and relatable.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
A fully computer-animated Abu is the first of many changes that furnish a hint of phoniness in a world that now demands a greater suspension of disbelief.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
Visually, this is a stunning feat along with incredible action stunts and choreography.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
Aladdin is much like its protagonist; flawed, a little clumsy, but ultimately quite winning; a diamond in the rough.

It is nonsense that tests my patience quota for two eternally boring hours. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
A nostalgic magic carpet ride that might not be ""a whole new world"" of original filmmaking, but is a welcome familiar world after the depressing downer ""Dumbo"" (2019).
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
Ritchie leaves behind his trademark slow downed style of editing in favour of some questionable speeded up dance sequences which look cheap and badly edited in the flamboyancy of imagination clearly taken from Bollywood.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
The production was so focused on making us remember the past that it did little to make the present memorable.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
This is one film that we would watch for the sake of it but come out of the theatre wishing for the good ol' days.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
Sure, it's almost exactly like the animated version, but they gave Jasmine the feminist edge that was sorely lacking in the cartoon.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
This live-action version of the Disney animated classic does a very good job capturing most of what made the original magical ... while expanding on the story and the characters.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
Will Smith puts a fun spin on proceedings. He brings his ""A"" game, which we haven't seen in some of his recent outings.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
Aladdin shows superior technical craftsmanship in so many aspects of the film, but its failure to reckon with a change of medium, bungling of story, and underwhelming characters, means that it is ultimately unsatisfying.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
An unimaginative remake that can be entertaining but feels empty and forgettable.
 "
Aladdin,57,94,critic,"
There's enough here to make the film stand out on its own. Whether it stands out for the right reasons is up to the viewer.

John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,audience,"Another no nonsense chapter in the John Wick trilogy. Picking up right where Chapter 2 left off and never letting it's foot off the gas. I was never a huge Keanu Reeves fan before this trilogy but this has definitely made me appreciate him more. Overall, a very solid action film, even if I did feel a little fatigue by the end of it from all of the action. I would definitely be down for another chapter if Lionsgate, Keanu and director Chad Stahelski were down."
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,audience,Really dull plot with overdose of brainless shooting. Worst movie I have seen for ages.
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,audience,I watched the whole episode. I was waiting for this film and even bought a poster
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,audience,"I loved the 2 installments of John wick after so many recommendations. The way the last one ended it gave me hope of a new story of the John Wick story. However, I was so badly disappointed. I didn't get to learn anything more about the main character beyond, he has special coins and tickets. The director, producer or anyone from the production could have dived into a back story instead of the OTT action which continued through the movie.

Many may compare John Wick to James Bond but at least one gave the audience a chance to breath, tell a story or even like at least one of the villains (James Bond).
Many people complained of the fight scene, and I can only agree. Too many times John Wick was open to be attacked but the stunt man or villains keep passing the chance. Please bring back the stunt choreographer from the first two movies and sack who ever wasted our two hours. I don't often give up on watching a movie 30 minutes from the end but I had to. It was predicted even felt like the end of the saga. This is a real shame."

John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,critic,"
The third chapter in the John Wick series shows the toll a story can take once filmmakers have to stretch it out beyond its natural ending. A series that was once praised for its simplicity is now too convoluted for its own good.

A hoot that features some of the coolest fight scenes in movies right now despite its excesses.

The stunts are consistently phenomenal, which is occasionally enough to distract from the silliness of the Continental and its exhaustive rules for murderers.

The gloriously rendered mayhem continues with this third entry in the series.
 "
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,critic,"
When a bruised and bloodied Keanu Reeves rides through a rain-lashed, neon-lit New York atop a literal dark horse to fight motorbike-riding fellow assassins, it's as brilliantly ludicrous as you've come to expect from the John Wick series.
 "
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,critic,"
To call this a high-octane actioner is an understatement so stark it's like saying Mel Gibson is slightly problematic.
 "
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,critic,"
Thanks to returning stunt-coordinator-turned-director Chad Stahelski, the film has no shortage of spectacular, breath-taking stunts and fight sequences to keep things moving once they kick off in a richly understated opening few scenes.

[T]he synthesis between those in front of and behind the camera rarely feels lost. It's perverse, beautiful, and brutal... and it rarely seems to last that long.

This is full-blooded cinema realising its full potential, with an entertaining internal logic, stunning setting and set pieces to die for.
 "
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,critic,"
A film that ups the ante on violence with some of the craziest fight sequences and highest body counts ever put on film, but a script that leaves room for little else as it jumps from action set piece to set piece.
 "
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,critic,"
It's a spectacle. Nothing more; nothing less. And that's enough.

You want to know if John Wick is back? Yeah, I think he's back.
 "
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,critic,"
The outrageous concept is amusing yet engaging. The action scenes are over the top, with bits of humour thrown in the mix. All in all, the film works. Mostly, the credit goes to Keanu Reeves for his unwavering and convincing performance.
 "
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,critic,"
Parabellum is exactly what you want in both a summer action film and a John Wick film. It's also the beginning of the series' gradual accent into controlled ridiculousness, the same fantastic way that the Fast & Furious franchise did.

Few, if any, franchise has objectified its central figure so gloriously, so effectively, as to make a statement about human form itself.
 "
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,89,86,critic,"
Like Mad Max: Fury Road, which was essentially a two-hour car chase, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is an adrenaline soaked two-hour fight sequence that somehow manages to top what we witnessed in Chapter 2.

Pet Sematary,57,33,audience,Poor Jud why'd he have to die.
Pet Sematary,57,33,audience,"Does King really need the money ? In the last decade or so, most of his writing has been redone for no specific gain. Some of the better ones have been left untouched, mainly due to the cast involved. The perfect examples being The Shining and Misery. I don't get the fixation with remaking old pictures, it merely smacks of literal deficiencies."
Pet Sematary,57,33,audience,"Built up with perfection tension and acting but a need to fit in with ""the cool kids"", Pet Semetary utilises its source material in new and interesting ways but feels it has to compare itself to other Horrors by implementing jump scares which let down its perfect atmosphere."

Pet Sematary,57,33,audience,Boring movie for such a good cast
Pet Sematary,57,33,audience,"I was pretty bored with PET SEMATARY and I should have known better. I have nothing against the man personally, but a handful of Jason Clarke's latest releases have been misses for me. From TERMINATOR GENISYS to WINCHESTER to the horrible SERENITY that was offered up earlier this year. I never read the book or saw the original so I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but the film takes some time to establish itself. The only part I somewhat enjoyed was maybe the last 5-10 minutes honestly."

Pet Sematary,57,33,audience,Enjoyed more than the original
Pet Sematary,57,33,audience,"Mary Lambert's Pet Semetary is one of the better Stephen King adaptions. One of King's most disturbing novels, she captures that sense of dread and horror masterfully. Skip the 2019 remake and stick to this gem."
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
If you need to satisfy that Stephen King itch, there is Gerald's Game on Netflix that I feel is worth the time and occupation. Life is too short to waste on mediocre horror.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
Gruesome and unpleasant, all while kinda-sorta insisting that it's making some kind of insight about the nature of death.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
Most of the changes are superficial and may not feel wholly necessary at the end of the day, but Kölsch and Widmyer have nevertheless crafted a sleek update of King's novel.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
I love where they're going with the dread, and you know death and dwelling on how insignificant we all are all that jazz, I love that about this film but it doesn't deliver as a standalone film for me.

The second time around for Stephen King's version of ""The Monkey's Paw"" is a hurried muddle that lacks heart.

King fans should be pleased.

It seems to me quite sloppy and it doesn't stop reducing itself all the time to the predictable mechanisms of the horror narrative. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
It's a scary film that earns its scares by making us care deeply for its characters. And while that isn't as much of a rarity in horror as it used to be, it still feels particularly special when someone gets it as right as this film does.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
A resurrected classic that turns out to be a comedy of grisly errors.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
While it's okay, ""Pet Sematary"" never does much to distinguish itself.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
This Pet Sematary falls firmly in between the book and the original movie ... In some respects, it feels closer in spirit to the novel, even with the number of changes made to the story.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
Still, there's fun to be had here.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
This newest adaptation proves that, when written and directed with care, there's still life in the world of horror created by Stephen King.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
Pet Sematary is a mechanically sound, if not entirely scary piece of storytelling.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
By building familiar scary imagery atop unceasing adult fears, Pet Sematary captures pragmatic, unshakable panic like a firm gut check.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
Pet Sematary is a perfectly functional little horror movie. It doesn't truck in '80s nostalgia, and its significant changes to the source material mostly turn out to be improvements.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
It's just a little too pulpy for the potential power of the story.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
Pet Sematary is so engrossed in its own self importance and supposed deeper meaning it forgets to frighten us, or even give us a reason to care in the first place.
 "
Pet Sematary,57,33,critic,"
An enjoyable but innocuous genre exercise which mostly misses the book's emotional weight.
 "
Us,93,59,audience,"While I did enjoy the movie, there were a lot of things that weren't that great including the predictable twist, the slow beginning, and the strange use of humor at the wrong times. However, the horror and action elements in this movie are phenomenal and Jordan Peele is an excellent director in making this happen. Hopefully, his next one will be another level above this one."
Us,93,59,audience,"Don't believe the hype. Well directed but one of the worst movies I've seen. And it goes on, and on, and on!"
Us,93,59,audience,"Great Casting, Great acting, Great directing. Amazing performance from Lupita Nyong'o. It's good but it's not as good as Get Out."
Us,93,59,audience,"The Good: Great performances, well-timed humour, an incredible twist ending and a director who doesn't under estimate his audience. 

The Bad: Middle act feels a little stale compared to the beginning and finale."
Us,93,59,audience,"Let's get it out of the way: Us isn't Get Out. It doesn't have a ton to say that's fresh and never approaches genre-defining like its predecessor. At times it can be undermined by it's excess of comedy or the literal darkness present in most of the scenes or even its fairly nonsensical climax, but ultimately Us is entertaining and creepy enough to be a good time."
Us,93,59,audience,"Expectations were high going in to this after Jordan Peele knocked his debut out of the park with GET OUT. And while the latter story has an element of suspension of disbelief to it in order for it to work, the same is true for US. However, this is one I could not buy in to. In GET OUT the element of the story that required buying in too was rather small and almost insignificant in the grander scheme of the film. With US, so much of the story was built upon this suspension that if you didn't buy in to it, you're going to have a bad time. I applaud Peele for his originality and I'm glad to see him devoting so much time to the horror genre and his attempts to bring fresh material to the table. I just hope he isn't a victim of his own success and he can develop a film more in tune with his first outing, as this was not a worthy successor in my opinion."
Us,93,59,audience,"us is a huge disappointment after ""get out"""
Us,93,59,audience,"""Us"" is definitely not a masterpiece, but has a decent story and interesting subtext that help overcome familiar genre clichés and a confusing twist."
Us,93,59,audience,"stupid movie, the lead roles logic/thinking doesn't seem to match with the current situation. Waste of time, and makes you feel hate the leads like you wanted the perpetrators to win over them. Can't finish the movie because I can no longer tolerate stupidity at its finest."
Us,93,59,audience,"Absolutely loved the movie, the plot twists are amazing and the acting was splendid all throughout the film. Would recommend watching!"
Us,93,59,critic,"
There's a messiness here, a beautiful anamorphic widescreen messiness that Peele seems to relish.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
Us introduces so many ideas that it can be difficult to focus. But it's fascinating to watch those ideas emerge, contort and dance around on screen, even if they don't always come together to form a cohesive story.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
An outlandish story but the powerful message resonates in Trump era America.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
While imperfect, Peele and his team get enough right with Us to make it a worthy follow-up to Get Out. Combining popcorn thrills with thoughtful commentary is Peele's calling card, something that should make him a director to watch for years to come.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
Smart and quick witted, Peele knows when he needs to be obvious - title Us also doubles as US, as above so below/mirror image concept, in a pivotal moment, and when to be subtle - ok, not really.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
The best advice I got before heading to the theater was just not to think too hard about it.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
Us is a perfect storm of horror, acting, and social commentary: a beautiful dark mirror that conveys a confidence seldom seen in sophomore efforts.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
What sets Us apart from others in the genre, and likewise Peele apart from his contemporaries, is the voice that whispers a warning in every scene, a foreboding that follows you out of the theater and into your sleeping subconscious.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
Jordan Peele delivers more of his now signature style, but also flips a switch on something you'd never expect. His ability to create another flawless and compelling story truly cements himself as a true Master of Horror.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
I love this film... in so many different ways.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
The cast is first-rate, while the cinematography, framing, and editing all sensationally contribute to the supremely disconcerting ordeals.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
The plot twists don't always add up and there are too many red herrings that create a sense of disappointment as Peele doesn't follow through.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
Peele's eagerly awaited second feature is here, and Us does not disappoint.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
With Us, another simplistic yet petrifying demonstration of the confrontational, Jordan Peele has announced himself as a master of horror.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
An amazing ensemble effort.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
A masterly double life feature that shows a comparison between good/evil, light/darkness, beautiful/putrid, and dance/violence. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
What Us demonstrates is that Jordan Peele is not a one-hit wonder. It's easy to compare him to cinematic greats like Hitchcock or Kubrick, but he's already established that he is in a league of his own.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
Taking too long to get there, Peele flubs an oddly inert home invasion when the family's maniacal scissor-wielding mirror images eventually show up. Basic jump scares abound, but there's no real terror.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
Allegory seeps from every pore of the story and there's undeniable joy in untangling the myriad plot threads in the hours after the credits roll.
 "
Us,93,59,critic,"
Scenes and set pieces begin to drag on for too long and . . . wear thin, especially once you realize that they're simple diversions from the themes Peele is trying to address.
 "
Glass,37,67,audience,"I saw this last night and I absolutely loved it! I didn't read any reviews going in to it but I heard they weren't positive. I really don't understand why? The story was incredibly strong and engaging. The cast was all top notch. Shyamalan always has his twist at the end (which in this case, was actually 2). Definitely better than SPLIT and as good, if not better, than UNBREAKABLE. I'm sure the story will end here but if Shyamalan decided he wanted to continue it, I'd be down for some more. I know it's too early in the year but I could see this being in my Top 10 all year, or worst case scenario, an honorable mention by years end. Go see it!"
Glass,37,67,audience,2019-6-16 James McCoy did a great job.  Why did he spread it to the world by suicide? Because he wouldn't escape from that?
Glass,37,67,audience,"It's easy to be disappointed by this movie at first glance. **Spoilers ahead** They build you up to this cool-sounding climactic ending and then it never happens. At first I was definitely disappointed about this. But then, after having watched several Marvel movies (like where Captain America TAKES DOWN A PLANE by himself) I realized that in his own subtle way M. Night is both paying homage to the superhero genre of the comic book world and a little bit poking fun of the superhero movie world. This movie is the antithesis of your traditional superhero movie, and I think I appreciate it all that much more for that. Not unlike ""Unbreakable"" you only get the tiniest taste of what's to come by the end, and I think that's maybe the best way to leave it. The imagination is so much more powerful than just showing you exactly what you want. So, while the movie has its flaws, it is a very solid and underrated gem."
Glass,37,67,audience,"Unifies Unbreakable (1999) and Split (2016) and tries to bring them to a conclusion.

The movie starts in an interesting manner and gets ruined with the freemasonic mantras/psychology of ""you are what you believe to be"" and ""you are superpowerful if you trust in yourself"". I will leave the reader to read William Schnoebelen's book on freemasonry (Masonry: Beyond the Light) to know whom (or what) they worship. It is a pity that what started as a classic confrontation between good and evil in ""Unbreakable"" turned into a sugar-coated cheap psychology self-assertion message.

Additionally, the morality of the movie is turned upside down in the final part of the movie. After being heavily wounded, Mr. Glass is on the floor, unrepentant of all the evil he has done, just to have his mother tell him ""you were spectacular"". Really? No moral compass in her to tell her son ""darling, you made a mess of yourself and others, please look around you all the people who died because of you""?

This inversion of moral values is pushed even deeper when by the end we see Mr. Glass' mother sitting with other characters of the movie who suffered because of her son as if nothing evil had been done. No call for reconciliation; no need for her to ask for forgiveness in the name of her son. After Mr. Glass actions motivated by ""the end justifies the means"", she sits with the other antagonists of the movie as if nothing had happened, just to have a final dose of ""believe in yourself and you will be almighty"" nonsense. 

PS: it is clear that there is a freemasonic influence in the movie, not only due to the moral content which I exposed above, but also because there is a scene in the Hospital where we see a hallway with a window in the end and a ladder extending on both sides of the window; these two compose a masonic arc."
Glass,37,67,audience,"M.knights best movie sense signs!
Which is to say pretty (*&^ bad."
Glass,37,67,audience,"The story is good, but comes off a little weak. The best part of the movie was James McAvoy, who deserves an award for his role in this movie."
Glass,37,67,audience,Very cool! James Mcavoy is amazing and worth the price of admission alone. Night gambled it all and it payed off! He does his own thing with the genre. Go with it and you'll have a blast!
Glass,37,67,audience,While absolutely not one of M. Night's best movies. It's still pretty fun
Glass,37,67,audience,"A little slow, but still a good movie."
Glass,37,67,audience,It's a good film and the focus is mainly on the villians but fortunately they are fun to watch. My only critique is that the ending needed more pep. The concept was good but needed restyling
Glass,37,67,critic,"
What was likely meant to be a meditation on the genre from Shyamalan comes off more like a lecture, one that will disappoint most superhero fans and skeptics alike.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
I'm not sure whether Shyamalan misses in his execution, or if his entire intent is to take the super hero genre to the back alley and shoot it.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
The film feels like a guest who has overstayed his welcome and starts to tell another story when asked to leave. It feels much like Shyamalan's cameo in the movie - a gargantuan effort, but one that is kind of awkward.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
Where Unbreakable is a careful deconstruction of the superhero story, Glass is a defiant middle finger, which would have been just fine if weren't so joyless in its execution.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
When McAvoy is on screen, the master is at work. He is the one redeeming quality in a film that attempts to elevate its predecessors. Instead, it only manages to muddy their good name.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
Shyamalan allows his penchant for credibility-stretching coincidence and on-the-nose dialogue to get the better of him by the end of the movie.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
It's not what people are going to expect, and isn't that really just the Shyamalan way?
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
I felt like it lacked general direction... but I did enjoy a lot of it.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
You can sense that Shyamalan thinks he's blowing our minds (which possibly is the worst thing one can feel while watching a movie).
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
The overarching themes of Shyamalan's franchise sound somewhat unfilmable, yet his players tackle the subjects with enough sincerity that they work part of the time.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
In spite of its needless exposition, Glass still thrives thanks to its attempts at dissecting comic book lore within a psychological thriller canvas.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
Glass brings all three 'gods amongst us' men together and proceeds to do almost nothing with them, other than allow them to mansplain their brilliance at each other at interminable length before even the film's plot loses interest in them.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
There isn't a single idea in Glass that Shyamalan didn't express with more flair almost two decades ago.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
Glass is too portentous to pass itself off as more than the sum of its parts.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
Here's hoping ""Glass"" makes enough money for Shyamalan to keep trying out new ideas rather than sidetracking into franchise building. My advice is to go back and treat yourself to the ride of ""Unbreakable"" and only peep ""Glass"" if you enjoyed ""Split.""
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
It's a film executed with a narrative touch that makes it stumble along the paths of trivial formulas, lacking visual fiber or any shock effect that is surprising. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
Glass is something I've genuinely wanted to see for 19 years. So it pains me to see certain elements of the movie work so well (the opening third is actually great), while others are irredeemable.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
Usually where you think a story zigs, Shyamalan zags. However, here, he took the conventional route that upended a satisfying ending to a trilogy.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
Glass suffers from either trying too hard, or not trying nearly hard enough.
 "
Glass,37,67,critic,"
Glass is a terrific and fitting conclusion to the trilogy ... Yet, don't expect some action-packed extravaganza filled with monumental set pieces and explosive fight sequences. This is the Unbreakable universe, after all.
 "
Jupiter Ascending,27,38,audience,"It is great visually but unfortunately for me there was just too many story flaws and plot holes from the very beginning. Plain and obvious things characters did that no normal human being would do with no attempt to explain why or hide this. From one of the very early scenes when Mila's character, Jupiter's father dies because he is more interested in saving his telescope from thieves than protecting himself OR his pregnant wife! It goes on from here to get less and less believable (and I don't mean because it's set on multiple spaceships etc with genetically engineered wolf-human hybrids and 14000 year old humans lol). Apart from the serious lack of judgement with with story line, there is another issue for me. The whole thing feels rushed imo. I can see how it could be hard to fit an entire new world into under 2 hours, never mind an entire universe BUT many other films and books manage this without having this same feel to them tbh. Lord of the rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars to name just a few for example, manage to draw the viewer/reader in from the very beginning all the way to the end of the last sequal, because of the fact that they completely submerge you in a magical or Sci fi reality in a way that let's you really feel and understand it, all the while building to a climactic ending that ties it all together making you feel satisfied and wanting more all at the same time. Jupiter Ascending however, felt more like watching Harry Potter through the window of someone else's sitting room somehow 😅 like I was seeing the events but not really getting to the bottom of them. They weren't set up well or finished well. There wasn't enough to the whole thing. It all left me feeling a bit... meh.. the dialog is another issue too btw.. its clunky and strange somehow. It lacks personality for most of the characters. As I write that I realise too that is the issue with the characters themselves, a lack of character. A lack of feeling. I didn't really care about any of them sadly. And I want that. I need to care about them but to care they need to be much more fleshed out than they are here.
In the end I think they tried to fit way too much unnecessary junk into the film and it ended up meaning they missed out on what makes a story like this great. The basic premise for the movie could be a great one and is similar to others that have gone before. All which were better"
Jupiter Ascending,27,38,audience,"7 years after its release, Jupiter Ascending still dazzles with spectacular VFX, action and fight scenes. It was also ahead of its time in casting Black actors in more prominent roles. However, the confusing story still befuddles and raises the question of why more attention wasn't given to laying out a cleaner narrative. 

Like I said, the action hooks you instantly and doesn't let up without feeling overwhelming or gratuitous (i.e. unnecessary action scenes designed to fill up the runtime).  The actors were well chosen and do justice to the kinds of characters they play BUT here's the problem.

Whenever a movie, other than a fairy tale, starts with a narrator, there's bound to be trouble. In this case it means BIG trouble because the main character, Jupiter (Mila Kunis) has to explain all the many confusing bits of the top heavy story. She starts with the chance meeting and love story of her parents. A few minutes later, her father, a nerdy astronomer (I think) is tragically killed when, for no reason, a gang of Russian thieves break in. For some reason her father is more concerned with saving his prized telescope (it does not have special powers) than protecting his pregnant wife and gets killed.

Mom goes into some sort of depression and gets on a ship (not a plane) bound for America where she gives birth to our heroine. Years pass, mom and daughter are now Russian-American maids, living in Chicago. Jupiter know she wants more from life than cleaning rich peoples houses but can't seem to get out of her funk. 

Meanwhile, far away in another part of the galaxy, a dysfunctional family of uber-rich siblings have cornered the market on ""harvesting"" planets to extract a kind of eternal youth serum (or slurry), drawing parallels with global profiteering companies who exploit developing resources from developing nations. Unfortunately, the moral lesson is too specific and would have been better reimagined as wicked aliens that slick space pirates. Earth turns out to be the prize that all three siblings (2 brothers and 1 sister) have their eye on since humans make an excellent youth potion.

I'm still not sure how they knew Jupiter was ""the chosen one"" but in any case, both brothers send emissaries to try to have her killed. Meanwhile, Jupiter's cousin has convinced her to sell her eggs to a fertility clinic so she can get back her father's telescope, which is for sale on eBay. Here's  where the cool action begins. The hero, Wise (Channing Tatum), rescues her from the ""clinic"" which is full of alien assassins and the intergalactic fireworks begin.

I'll leave off there. If the story had simply started with a lost teen who had some realistic reason to believe she was the heir to an intergalactic fortune - a token, a tattoo, a magic orb - the story would have aligned more neatly. But adding in too much botching those critical first 10 minutes of screen time and sticking in ""explanations"" makes Jupiter Ascending quickly fall."

Star Wars: The Force Awakens,93,86,audience,"After the horrible prequel trilogy, Star Wars gets back on track with The Force Awakens.

Jam packed with action and visually stunning scenes. JJ Abrams did an incredible job bringing back the aura of the original trilogy with much needed new energy.

I had so much hype about this movie and it still exceeded my expectations."
Star Wars: The Force Awakens,93,86,audience,"It's the first Star Wars film in many years (over 35), with the magic and optimism that A New Hope had.  JJ Abrams has found the perfect cast (almost), and created the perfect tone for the reset of the third trilogy.  If only he'd been in charge of the last trilogy."
Star Wars: The Force Awakens,93,86,audience,This one was good but not good enough.

Star Wars: The Force Awakens,93,86,audience,As a kid who grew up with Star Wars and getting to experience the prequel‘s at a young age and loving them (at the time…) this film was exciting and nostalgic. It was an emotional roller coaster with so many moments of “yes” being exclaimed. 
Star Wars: The Force Awakens,93,86,audience,This one was much better than some of the other Star Wars films. I liked the characters as much as the plot. Great movie.
Star Wars: The Force Awakens,93,86,audience,"A welcome return to the world of Star Wars, with JJ Abrams providing a story pretty much identical with A New Hope but with different characters. BB-8 is just and annoying droid and nothing compared to C-3PO and R2-D2 who get very little screen time. Ben Solo is not a satisfying villain, coming across as a tantrum teenager."
Star Wars: The Force Awakens,93,86,audience,Just completely undoes everything that happened in the last six movies while blatantly copying everything from them. It also prevented us from getting a much more interesting sequel trilogy.
Star Wars: The Force Awakens,93,86,audience,"The movie has a lot of strong moments. Previously known characters are well integrated. I also like the dynamic and mystery around the two new young main protagonists so far, who seem to build a counterforce to each other. Dialogues aren't always thought through though and sometimes, the motivation of certain actions is completely unclear. In these moments, the viewer almost has the impression as if something was cut out and they've just missed the last 5 minutes. Most likely, this is just plot armor and these dialogues and actions just reflect an idea of the writers that had to happen but no one thought how to show the viewer why these things had to happen. In the first part, the viewer might not be very annoyed by this, though, because it fits well into the overall mystery that the viewer might expect to be resolved in the future parts."

Lucky Grandma,95,69,audience,"I'm not sure why critics are lowballing this movie so much. Tsai Chin does amazing work with a role that could have gone horribly wrong with the wrong actor, and she makes even the wackiest parts seem somehow grounded. The writing and direction are taut and entertaining, and a meaningful theme about loneliness, grief, anger, and vulnerability is just below the surface. All of this without being heavy-handed about it. And as if that's not enough, it takes a well-worn sub-genre (found money) and, without too many spoilers, does something new with it. It's the best movie no one is watching."
Lucky Grandma,95,69,audience,"So many unexpectedly funny scenes. And the characters were a delight -- so different than what we normally see in film, especially ones that involve Chinese gangsters. Anyone who appreciates a good indie film with a lot of humanity would enjoy this, but for Chinese Americans this will really hit home."

Come for the performances, stay for the story and you'll be rewarded with a fun flick.  Final Score: 8.6/10"

Four Kids and It,49,23,audience,"Literally one of the worst films I've ever watched. Like why? There is nothing big that happens in it, nothing that the four kids have to try and do; for example there could have been a plot twist where the kids have to try and save 'it'. There's also a disgusting part near the start of the movie where the boy pukes all over the floor. Would not recommend to anyone."

Four Kids and It,49,23,audience,"The attempt was there. As I watched, I didn't  finish. This movie caused extreme amounts of boredom, from this want to be Harry and the Henndersons or E.T movie"
Four Kids and It,49,23,audience,"Directed by British filmmaker Andy De Emmony, Four Kids and It is inspired by the novel Four Children and It by Jaqueline Wilson, which is based in the 1902 book Five Children and It by Edith Nesbit.

This new story is modern and follows two families: the divorced parents are dating and the four kids—two from each parent—share a vacation together in Cornwall, England. The kids don't get along at the beginning, and they have to spend time together and accept their parents' relationship. At the beach, they discover a strange creature that emerges from the sand and grant wishes. One wish per day will be conceded to each kid each day. Despite things not necessarily turning out the way they expect, after each adventure, they discover the importance of bonding and family.

Four Kids and It combines fantasy, magic and drama. The plot is entertaining and there are so many beautiful moments but some things, doesn't work that well. Russell Brand plays Tristan Trent, an eccentric owner of a mansion who wishes more wealth and lives by the beach where the kids find the creature. That part of the storyline doesn't flow that well, and the way it intertwines with the main storyline is not that engaging. The talented Brand doesn't shine as usual and his character is not taken fully advantage of in those scenes.

Ashley Aufderheide and Teddie-Rose Malleson-Allen carry the film. They play the two older daughters and their characters are pivotal to the story. Their acting is strong and is one of the greatest assets of the film.

As the voice of the creature we have Michael Caine, and the actor gives the creature, Psammead, the tone of elegance and wisdom that characterizes him. I found this creature adorable and the facial expressions mimic the actor's resemblance. The CGI is very well implemented, and all the scenes with Psammead are my favorite scenes.

The landscapes and cinematography are beautiful and the story is overall entertaining with magic, flying scenes and humor.

The message of the film is simple: be careful what you wish for, but, at the same time, show us that our deepest wishes may be granted within our real and simple life in the joy of family and friendship.

This is a great family movie that little kids and parents can enjoy together. I give Four Kids and It 4 out of 5 starts and recommend it to kids 4 to 14.

First Love,97,88,audience,Pretty good entertaining movie. I've been pushing this movie off for 2 years now and the wait is over and man I'm glad I didn't want ten years to watch this movie because I would've been disappointed.
First Love,97,88,audience,"There are plenty of layers to 'First Love', a Takashi Miike film that is bonkers.  While there are a couple mysterious choices this is a crime drama that has all the elements.  It starts slowly and let me give you some advice since I haven't said this in a while:  'Don't watch the trailer!'  I heard from people that the trailer includes a lot of scenes from the third act, which is why I never watch trailers.  Miike is able to film scenes that are ordinary and make them extraordinary.  This is a fantastic feature that isn't for the faint of heart but it's a genre-bending thriller that is terrific.  Final Score: 8.3/10"

But whatever, my real issue with this is just how mainstream and tame it is. It's a morally-correct, damsel-in-distress movie with a few ""teehee"" moments and maybe slightly higher violence than some other action movies. I didn't care about the characters. I didn't care about the plot. I didn't care about the ending. If you had a stressful day at work and want to ease your mind with a wholesome, modern story of justice and the occasional decapitation then maybe this is your movie. If you want something weird, stylish, controversial, thought-provoking, challenging, or interesting at all, then I can't recommend this."
First Love,97,88,audience,"First Love is the type of movie that I was rooting for 2019. I love the direction of Takashi Miike, the performances of Sakurako Konishi, Masataka Kubota, Shota Sometani and Nao Omori, the action sequences, the comedic tone, the story and the one animated scene near the end. I see nothing wrong with this movie because it brought me emotion, laughs and action. Overall, First Love brought home the goods right on time."
First Love,97,88,audience,"I really love this movie filled with entertainment from start to end 
every frame is beautiful  even you don't the language you will enjoy it"
First Love,97,88,audience,Pretty good entertaining movie. I’ve been pushing this movie off for 2 years now and the wait is over and man I’m glad I didn’t want ten years to watch this movie because I would’ve been disappointed.
First Love,97,88,audience,I guess I do have a favorite director
First Love,97,88,audience,"Don't know what the hype is all about. No pretense of a real story, just everyone killing everyone else."
First Love,97,88,critic,"
An epitome of Takashi Miike's entertaining and violent film catalog, First Love combines a slapstick yakuza crime story with young romance. And I love it.

By contrasting the funny violence of our criminals with Leo's realistic boxing, Miike shows that the only kind of violence worthy of humanity is a violence born out of love.

First Love is a grand guignol of sparring, slashing, stabbing and shooting interrupted by muted stretches of character development.

Miike is still Miike, still bad to the bone.

Just Mercy,85,99,audience,"The true story of civil right lawyer Bryan Stevenson (played by Michael B. Jordan) who dedicates his life to free innocent men on death row in Alabama. The movie primarily deals with the case of Walter McMillian (played by Jamie Foxx), who wrongly spent 6 years on death row between the years 1987-1993. Going in to this, you know what to expect: a heartfelt story about the injustice the criminal justice system and racism can reap and sow. Other than the tragedy that this story is, the performances are flat. Oscar bait, one in which I don't think the Academy will bite as this is a pretty forgettable movie."
Just Mercy,85,99,audience,"This movie will make you feel injustice and systemic racism in your bones, deep stuff."
Just Mercy,85,99,audience,"Dramma giudiziario tratto da una storia vera, intenso e ben interpretato da due meravigliosi attori.
Il film decide di concentrarsi sulle ingiustizie subite dal personaggio di Foxx e sul comportamento del testimone che lo aveva fatto condannare.
Vengono invece parzialmente tralasciati gli altri casi, che io avrei preferito vedere un minimo più approfonditi.
Il finale è intenso ma forse leggermente troppo veloce dopo quasi 2 ore di sofferenza."
Just Mercy,85,99,audience,Solid performances and a powerful story help bring this movie above many other legal dramas.
Just Mercy,85,99,audience,"This film is yet another testament of all the most horrible injustice committed against humans, innocent victims of bias, racism and corruption, in the society as well as the legal system - and for nothing less, it should be a statement to them and to the ban of death penalty."
Just Mercy,85,99,audience,"For all the urgency and import of its message, the predictable and generic storytelling undermines the filmmakers' message about the moral necessity of recognizing the dignity of individual human lives crushed by a soulless penal system that sees the mass of Black men as interchangeable numbers."
Just Mercy,85,99,audience,only movie to make me cry. really good movie

Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
Just Mercy is another great showcase for Jordan, Larson, Foxx, and Cretton, and a reminder that advocates like Stevenson are needed to ensure our justice system remains fair for everyone.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
A graceful, sharp and impeccably acted film that packs an emotional punch in the quietest and most profound ways possible.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
Filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton has infused Just Mercy with a matter-of-fact sensibility that suits his and Andrew Lanham's familiar screenplay quite well.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
The film shows us how the legal system can be manipulated by the rich and privileged across the globe. Although Just Mercy takes its time to get there, the conclusion is unquestionably impactful.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
Just Mercy isn't a groundbreaking film, but it's an optimistic one. If you need a little hope and emotional release these days, this movie will give you some.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
Foxx does his best work in a decade. For the charismatic Jordan, who puts in a tone-setting nuanced turn here, Just Mercy arrives between Creed II and Tom Clancy's Without Remorse. Let's hope he sticks with the ""one for them, one for me"" formula.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
""Just Mercy"" is solid, meat-and-potatoes docudrama filmmaking, if you don't mind a first-rate story of systemic injustice undercut by second-rate dialogue.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
Unlike many movies ""based on a true story,"" ""Just Mercy"" sticks close to the facts of the case - for the simple reason that the facts are drama enough.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
It's both rage-inducing and awe-inspiring; the courage conveyed by the protagonists is a balm on the sting of injustice.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
What Just Mercy lacks in flashy storytelling it makes up for in its earnest examination of injustice and discrimination.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
The movie is overlong, even if the scenes with the relevant characters - and the final revelations, with stirring speeches - are riveting.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
Jordan's subdued performance is intriguingly captivating, and Foxx finds humanity and hope within the confinement and ever-present cloud of death looming overhead.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
It's an accessible crowd pleaser with powerful drama and surprising levity and deserves a watch based on its inspirational telling of a fight for justice.

Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
Just Mercy may rely on formulaic structures and predictability to illustrate its point, especially in its highly charged final third, but it is hard to walk away from this film without being moved.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
It's more than just a courtroom drama, it is a very pertinent story that shoulders its responsibility with a steady hand and a focus that matches Brian Stevenson's idealism.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
Totally ignored by this year's Academy Awards after debuting to great acclaim at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, this staggeringly good legal drama further fuels #OscarsSoWhite accusations.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
Cretton's Just Mercy is a moving film with committed performances. Johnny D's trial scenes are taut and emotional.
 "
Just Mercy,85,99,critic,"
Just Mercy doesn't preach to its audience. It simply shows us the irrefutable facts and allows us to draw our own inevitable conclusions.

Rocketman,89,88,audience,"i do not care this is the best movie to ever exist. and if it's not, yes it is"
Rocketman,89,88,audience,I have been a fan since the early days....but I thought this was a bad movie.   Bears little or no relation to anything.
Rocketman,89,88,audience,"I find this film slightly overrated. even though I still liked it, I just found certain moments boring and shocked to see that they didn't have candle in the wind in there. I'm personally not a fan of Elton John also."
Rocketman,89,88,audience,"A solid film about the life of Elton John, not as well done as past biopics such as Straight Outta Compton or Bohemian Rhapsody.

I wish they did a more straightforward film rather than the musical vibes."
Rocketman,89,88,audience,I LOVE this movie. I can find anything wrong with this movie.
Rocketman,89,88,audience,Best movie i’ve ever seen. Not only did it change my view of Elton John and his music but also just music in general. Beautiful film.
Rocketman,89,88,audience,"The life of Elton John, told through an unflinching R-rated (thank you!) film and at times, musical. Taron Egerton did a wonderful job as Elton and while overall the film was enjoyable and wasn't too much of a musical (except towards the end). The last 30-45 minutes they seem to cram more musical numbers in which felt forced and rushed and took away from the final product. Not a bad movie at all, but definitely not on the BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY level."
Rocketman,89,88,audience,"Rocketman desperately wants to be across the universe, but in a ""biopic"" it comes off as a glossed over fantasy. The film had no real substance and no character development, all while pretending to be a biography. It constantly showered the protagonist in a fast paced charade of negativity to bring him to the point of rock bottom, instead of showing the journey to his point of his redemption. Although the film was caught in a ""no man's land"" of Hollywood antics, the acting, and some well written scenes, brings the overall rating barely up from one star.

Cannot recommend."
Rocketman,89,88,audience,"Woof, that was a slog. Couldn't get through the whole thing because there were too many scenes that just seemed like actors pretending to be in a music video. Painfully boring and one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
Rocketman,89,88,audience,I really wanted to punch Richard Madden in that pretty face of him in here
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
An insulting movie ... desperately groping for some semblance of autobiography.
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
Showing how fantastical the ups and downs of fame, fortune and rock stardom can be by sashaying through a sea of surreality, the result is a winning marriage of form and feeling.
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
Rocketman doesn't follow the conventions of most music biopics, and it's all the better for it.
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
... a lot better than it probably has a right to be.

Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
Glittering eye candy with much humanity on display.

I recommend Rocketman to audiences that are fans of musicals, emotional journeys, and movies about real-life people. It's one of the best movies of the year, and deservingly so.
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
In the leading role, Taron Egerton absolutely shone as Elton. The fact he actually sang so many of his iconic songs, and did them well, is something that should be celebrated for years to come.

Whatever Rocketman' s shortcomings, or its subject's, the film is an exhilarating ride and a reminder of why so much of Elton John's music is appealing and enduring.

It is a purely conventional, predictable and frivolous biopic that barely brushes the surface of the protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
In the context of Elton John's life, many of his songs take on extra meaning. The result feels fantastical and edges into the realm of magical realism; if that wasn't built to tell Elton John's story, I don't know what was.
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
The film works best when it's too fast for its hero. It's frustrating, then, that it's too fast for itself as well.
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
Dexter Fletcher gives a duly reverent and indulgent treatment of a man who confounds a culture still trying to define him.
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
Even as the film is every bit as flashy and ebullient as the man it celebrates, it falls disappointingly short - certainly to a far greater extent than last year's Bohemian Rhapsody did - of being a rounded portrait of a life and a career.
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
Rocketman takes the traditional musical idea of songs being the outward expression of a character's inner thoughts and allows us a deep dive into the mind of this artistic genius.
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
Elton John's robust rockers and heartfelt earnest songs all get their proper due in tonally perfect context.
 "
Rocketman,89,88,critic,"
Good performances, fun songs.

2040,100,42,audience,"I loved it. Finally, a positive look at what is possible to achieve in a short amount of precious time. As a parent it has made me hopeful and motivated to start a big project to do our part for our boys. Thank you for the inspiration. Keep up the amazing work. 
To future viewers: please ignore the climate change denier trolls leaving their negative feedback. This is even explained in the documentary. It's a predictable response to a documentary leading people away from lethal fossil fuels, the trolls are funded by the fossil fuel investors."
2040,100,42,audience,2040 is a one sided movie. I was surprised when they had kids making comments on different subjects and the presenter then denigrating one of the kids later on referring to him as ‘hot dog boy' in an extremely condascending manner.
2040,100,42,audience,"I feel more stupid for having the temerity to give this a glance, based on the conflicting scores, here."
2040,100,42,audience,"The movie was utopian with ideals based on toxic wind and solar, and other environmental diasters, as if they are sustainable and environmental. A great feel good movie, with no practical or truthful outcomes. 

Clearly a propaganda piece and a great insight into the millennial mindset; ignoring evidence to present a new paradigm that has already in the past been tested and thown away, but as long as you feel good, it must be right... #wrong."
2040,100,42,audience,Propaganda plain and simple.
2040,100,42,audience,I think that any movie Rotten Tomatoes gives 100% to isamovie you should run away from as fast as you can because they always end up being a horrible and boring.
2040,100,42,audience,"Left wing emotional propaganda. 
But, I liked the way that the documentary was put together."
2040,100,42,audience,"It's Warming, it's cooling and then it's changing...
Now we have a climate.
""change & accept the New Normal.""
No thanks, not suitable for children & young adults."
2040,100,42,audience,"Good to have the belief that science, innovation and the human spirit can overcome our the impacts of our addiction to fossil fuels. It is sad that this has become a partisan sparring match rather that trying to do something practical and  common-sensical. for the great world we live on.. Even with the films imperfections, I am glad someone tried to capture this spirit on film,   Room for improvement but high marks for tying to make a difference."
2040,100,42,audience,This is an absurdly patronizing venture in some twisted hypothetical by a bunch of politicized social justice warriors. Stay away.
2040,100,42,critic,"
It's all a bit too pie-in-the-sky, but it's better to shoot for the stars than not shoot at all when it comes to changing the world.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
If the documentary 2040 were a book, it would be the CliffsNotes of environmentalism ... Although environmentalism is not an original topic for a documentary, it's told in a unique way in 2040.

A dash of eco-optimism to counter global-warming doom and gloom. Gameau is an enormously engaging fact-based dreamer offering a much-needed mindset refresh and proactive actions we can engage in now.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
Has a simple premise: How can today's ideas and technologies be implemented now to make a better world in 2040? The answers are amazing.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
What 2040 offers is solutions-more than just pipe dreams, but real, practical solutions.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
The status quo is unsustainable, and Gameau illustrates that transformative change is not only necessary, but possible.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
Gameau places himself ... not only at the heart of the story, but embedded within composited images that illuminate his main points with humor, rather than despair.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
2040 points a practical, achievable path toward solutions, but its most important contribution is a sense that change is possible.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
The effect is admittedly as annoying as it is insightful, but the optimism of Gameau's approach is undeniably refreshing.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
Although 2040 can come across like a heavy-handed way of making its point, the film's heart and head are in the right place.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
Although the odds of implementing all these ideas might seem steep, ""2040"" is a rare climate documentary with an optimistic message.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
An almost tearfully optimistic take on a subject that has long lived on ""gloom and doom.""
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
A self-declared exercise in 'fact-based dreaming' 2040 has a certain naive optimism but couldn't we all do with a dose of that right now?
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
Gameau is a charming-enough host, though lacks the gravitas of someone like David Attenborough. Still, a positive voice like his deserves to be heard.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
Often there is something likable and practical about what Gameau is proposing.
 "
2040,100,42,critic,"
Expect this uplifting and engaging documentary to become staple and popular classroom viewing over the next few years.

On the Basis of Sex,73,76,audience,"Loved this movie, inspiring and empowering."
On the Basis of Sex,73,76,audience,"A solid enough and inspiring biopic about the late, great Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It tells her story from when she started university in the 1950s as one of very few woman allowed at the time to study at Harvard and charts her career as a professor at Columbia before going on to take on cases relating to sexual equality. Notable and centrally to the movie the case Charles E Moritz who was denied a deduction in his taxes to cover the care for his elderly mother which would have been allowed had he been a woman or a widower. 
A truly remarkable woman, the movie shows how Bader Ginsburg balanced a family life, personal difficulty and discrimination to become one of the standout figures of the equality movement in the late 20th and early 21st century.
Not only is this movie educational and moving it is also an uplifting story about a truly great woman who's loss is a blow to the civil liberties and liberal movement not only in the USA but also around the world."

 "
On the Basis of Sex,73,76,critic,"
Ginsburg's problems evaporate almost as soon as they appear through the magic of cinema created by director Mimi Leder, who apparently wants to make sure no audience member feels anything but the tepid glow of constant affirmation.
 "
On the Basis of Sex,73,76,critic,"
Felicity Jones makes Ginsburg so immediately likable that the movie's frequent invocations of her stubbornness and exacting expectations feel a lot more theoretical than experienced.
 "
On the Basis of Sex,73,76,critic,"
A feel good history lesson, a movie that provides a look at Ginsburg's determination, intelligence and humanity but one that goes too heavy on the hagiography.

By the time the main case of this biography takes hold, it's downright gripping to witness the legality of gender-based discrimination and the attack against it.

On the Basis of Sex may be rather safe and old fashioned in terms of its filmmaking style. However, it is still a wonderfully accessible biopic.

Felicity Jones, so credible as Jane Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything,"" brings similar credence to the role of Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg has lived an exceptional life ... On the Basis of Sex lets her down with a mundane, conventional approach at telling that story.
 "
On the Basis of Sex,73,76,critic,"
Though it has the feel of a TV film, On the Basis of Sex is worth paying to see for Jones' portrayal of Ginsburg's iron will.

Hearts Beat Loud,92,73,audience,"Plot is bland and predictable. The characters are boring and uninteresting. For a musical focused story, the songs are pretty atrocious. I understand people might feel connected and moved by the subject of their kids leaving to college, but this tale is pretty weak."
Hearts Beat Loud,92,73,audience,"Hearts Beat Loud is nearly always an inch away from being overly adorable, but it somehow manages to stay within the boundaries of genuine feel-good territory for the entirety of its run time. The father-daughter relationship and dynamic is touching and is most often sold by Nick Offerman's quiet, but real, performance."
Hearts Beat Loud,92,73,audience,"Reviewed 1.18.21  At times it's a charming and heart-warming tale of a father and daughter that stumble upon a potential indie music career. As a result, they both must consider what it is that defines them personally, and how to recapture their bond as they enter different phases of their lives. 

The story loses steam in its final third, but there's enough here for fans of indie music and coming-of-age stories. Ted Danson adds some lighthearted fun in a supporting role, and musician Keegan DeWitt does a serviceable job providing original tunes for the film. But it just doesn't handle the subject matter in a substantial enough manner to recommend it."
Hearts Beat Loud,92,73,audience,"Heart Beats Loud, an American film directed by Brett Haley portrays the life of Frank, played by actor Nick Offerman, a father who owns a record store that is on the verge of closing at the beginning of the movie. Frank has a daughter named Sam, played by actor Kiersey Clemons, she is studying to become a doctor, and is about to go to college. The film heavily hints at a musical background between Frank and Sam, playing together since she was a kid, and both loving music. One night, at the beginning of the film, Frank convinces Sam to play some music with him and to stop studying for college. The pair play for a while and Frank looks through some of Sam's songbooks, where he finds a song he'd like to play and work on. They work for a while and then come up with a final recording. Frank plays guitar while Sam sings and plays the synthesizer. The next morning Frank is at a coffee shop and he hears the song over the sound system. The song had become a hit on Spotify. He tells Sam when she comes back to their home, and she is not excited. Frank wants to finally start their dream band, Sam does not. At the end of the film, Frank is forced to close his record store. The duo decides to play live music on the last day of the store sell out. They blow the crowd away with amazing songs and music. The movie ends without telling what happened next, if Sam went to college, or if she continued in the band, the rest is left up to the viewer's imagination. The film also weaves in other subplots and a relationship between Frank and his landlord, a relationship between Sam and her girlfriend.

The movie is well written and produced. Every scene has a memorable meaning and feel. The actors always seem to know what they are doing and why and work in perfect conjunction with the camera moves and sound changes, hinting at a well-developed screenplay. The dialogue is very realistic, most of it is between the father and daughter, but the other dialogue in the film also feels very genuine and believable. The characters are very believable, in part because they are set in the present day, act very well, and have relationships and personalities that are believable, and that most viewers have seen somewhere in their own lives. The characters also show flaws in personality throughout the movie which also really helps the film seem realistic because, in the real world, nobody is perfect. The film portrays a great, heartfelt story that can be remembered and thought about once the movie has ended. Many might even find the film relatable, the struggle of college, preparing to pay for college, young love and old love. The writing was somewhat predictable, and some people may not like this but I think that what makes the story so believable and close to home.

The camera work used in the movie is wonderful. Great lighting in the day and at night fills the screen with rich tasteful colors and a depth of scene that almost begs the viewer into it. The movie did not seem to have any favorite camera shots, most of the shots were interior. Because many of the shots were interior there were a lot of close-ups, cutaways and medium shots used. When there were outside scenes wide shots were used. The movie also had a great sound, a needed factor for a movie filled with musical instruments and delicate speaking. The camera work made the viewer feel inside the scene as opposed to an outsider looking in, it made the viewer feel as if they were right alongside the main characters. Many smooth, slow pans and tilts, no fast-moving or shaky hand-held camera work. The movie comes through as smooth and well filmed.

The editing of the film was a normal experience. The editing did nothing special in particular but portrayed the film understandably and smoothly. There were no issues in the editing of the movie, nothing seemed out of place, the story was easy to follow and there were no overwhelming effects or transitions. Each cut in the film seemed to be meticulously placed so that the watcher would barely be able to notice it, and that they would just continue to interpret the film. The editing allowed for time for the viewer to adjust to new scenes, places, and times through the use of ambient noise and scenery before the action of the scene started. All of this contributed to the film having a good flow, and understandable story, and a great message."
Hearts Beat Loud,92,73,audience,"Frank Fisher runs an honest-to-goodness record store in relatively modern day Brooklyn, and it's about to go under.  He's worried, mostly because his daughter Sam is about to go to UCLA for med school, and helping her pay for that is a top priority.  He also has a mother with dementia who keeps wandering off and getting arrested.  How will all this be resolved?

Well, this movie is really not all that interested in these things.  Frank (Nick Offerman) also PLAYS music, and was once in a band with Sam's (Kiersey Clemons) mother.  A mother killed a lot of years ago in a cycling accident.  Sam also plays some music, and although she's very studious and very into being a doctor, she still indulges her father with occasional ""jam sessions.""  One night, she brings a song she's started writing to one of these sessions.  This results in the song ""Hearts Beat Loud"" to be recorded and Frank uploads it to Spotify, where is makes a modest splash.  He's excited about forming a real band with his daughter and seeing what they can make of a musical partnership.  She's interested in being a doctor and in spending time with her new girlfriend Rose (Sasha Lane).  THIS conflict is the real meat of the story, and even that is truly overcome by the music.

Clemons and Offerman (who knew!) actually perform in this film, and the music they ""create"" (the songs were written by others) and play together is what makes the movie a charmer.  First of all, Offerman is totally convincing as a slightly grump guy who loves music and loves his daughter, and when he gets to combine the two, his sheer delight is transporting.  Offerman practically glows, and having enjoyed his flat, grumpy persona for so many years, seeing him expand on that is a joy.  This movie is his show, really.  Clemons is refreshingly unaffected in her performance, and it's great to see a father/daughter relationship that shows the pair fighting (at times) but not once feeling that the underlying love and commitment is at risk.  But while Clemons is quite charming, in my opinion as a middle aged white male, Offerman's performance is the revelation.  Others will feel differently...but I think either way would make the film fun.  Just watching these two play together and create songs together is really quite lovely.  The rest of the ""drama"" of the film is quite secondary, although the plot points DO need be resolved, and some are resolved more convincingly than others.

The stuff with Offerman's mom (Blythe Danner) really barely registers, except that we see it as yet another pressure on HIM.  His relationship with his land lady (Toni Collette, always a welcome presence) waffles between romance and friendship, and will sweet, is not gripping.  Offerman does have some nice scenes with his local bartender (Ted Danson...who enlivens almost every effort he's in these days).  On the other side, Sam's relationship with Rose isn't terribly gripping either.  They are facing the idea that Sam's move to the other coast will doom their relationship, but we have virtually no emotional investment in them as a couple.  

SO, in the end, the joys of this movie are simple and light.  Watching two charming performers enjoying playing music together and enjoying the TIME spent making music together.  It's a delightful and heartening father/daughter relationship.  I suppose if there are any revelations beyond ""music can be transporting"" would be the notion that ""fathers and daughters can love each other with ease, despite any dramas that arise.""  It's nice to see played out and makes the whole film seem cozy.  And I really, really enjoyed this lived-in performance from Offerman.  

The ""plot"" and the resolutions of the various conflicts are secondary and never feel terribly important.  Some are resolved in a satisfactory way and others are virtually forgotten.  It matters because it makes this movie feel somewhat incomplete as a story.  But I still recommend going on this journey with these two characters."
Hearts Beat Loud,92,73,audience,"Hearts Beat Loud was perhaps the most pretentious and heavy handed movies I've ever seen. The writing is essentially desperate trope after desperate trope hoping to appeal to ""hip"" millennial sensibilities. By 20 minutes into the movie I knew what I was dealing with, but watched through to the end out of macabre curiosity. Truly an awful movie."
Hearts Beat Loud,92,73,audience,"Incredibly likable musical drama with a sensational score, a near-perfect cast (Offerman has never been better) and terrific vibe; only a few too many loose ends scriptwise keep this from the tippy top tier, though it's definite worth your while.

Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,97,88,audience,"exciting, captivating, suspenseful, and girl power! This film had high expectations, a huge budget, lots of hype, and it did not disappoint! Knowing that Tom does his own stunts makes it that much cooler to watch. I was on the edge of my seat for two and a half hours! The plot twists and complicated storylines were captivating, although I think Henry Cavill's character development could have used some more work. The music and sound effects were classic, appropriate and added to the scene without being overwhelmingly loud or distracting - no small feat! Also, I love the strong, powerful, badass women in this movie!"
Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,97,88,audience,This is a good one. Defitinitely recommend it if you are looking for action
Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,97,88,audience,"Scenes, script, plot, and action of excellence. He had never seen a great action movie like this, nor an actor so brave and great to do scenes like the ones in this movie. Without a doubt the best action movie of the year, or perhaps of the decade. And to make something clear: Mission Impossible is not worthy of the Oscars, The Oscars are not worthy of the Mission Impossible saga."
Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,97,88,audience,"the best of the mission Impossible Franchise. it contains thrilling music, great villains and is a splendid continuation from the previous film."
Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,97,88,audience,"One of the best directed action movies in recent years, certainly one of the best in this decade. Usually, sequels get worse and worse. Mission Impossible is the one of few movies I can think of that gets better and better with each part. It's almost unbelievable that the sixth sequel to any franchise looks this good and fresh. Interestingly, the director changed for each film in the series and this film is the first where the director team remained the same. The last three are very good, and this one is probably the best in terms of quality. An interesting story that requires attention, tense action scenes that are at the highest level. I must also mention Tom Cruise who is a masterful actor as well as an action star who participates in various stunts. Shooting, driving, racing, jumping, parkour, flying, the character did absolutely everything in a very tense film through his 140 minutes, which is not a small amount for an action film. one of the most appreciated things about Cruise is that what he does onscreen is real. He really does those leaps between buildings. (He broke his ankle on one of those leaps and shut down production for seven weeks.) He really does drive a motorcycle at high speeds against traffic. He really does fly a helicopter. Who knows what motivates this guy, but the results are incredible. The music, the stunts, the actors, the cities, and the landscapes. Everything was put together amazingly well. And an ending scene that you will never forget. And, some people may find the plot quite complicated, and it is. You really need to pay attention. I recommend watching MI5, and, if you have time, all the others. There is a reference to all of them along with the movie."
Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,97,88,audience,I just think that this one movie didn't bring anything new to the franchise. They repeated the same nice tools that made the MI so famous. This one specially comes with a dark side narrative. But nothing else to add.
Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,97,88,audience,Entertaining but silly.  The rest of the family hated it and won't watch another MI movie.
Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,97,88,audience,A long and tedious film with cardboard cut out characters and a Tom and Jerry style plot.
Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,97,88,audience,"I liked this movie a lot, but it is not a 10/10 masterpiece. It is a fun, thrilling action movie that is what it is. Nothing more, nothing less."
Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,97,88,audience,The franchise shows no signs of slowing down. It’s a typical intricate M:I plot (with narrative threads going back to Rogue Nation) goosed with spectacular fights and chases.

The physical proximity to each character and each movement is so minute, so aurally and visually sweeping, that Fallout is often slick as all hell.

Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,audience,Grace Jones is great but this was a mess. Hard to follow and lacking context and direction.

Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,audience,1. Take one of the most fascinating people on earth 2. Make a dull documentary about them
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,audience,A mess of a movie. The director doesn't even identify who is speaking so other than Grace herself you have no idea who she's interacting with. And the film meanders all over the place and drags whenever it's not showing concert footage. Very disappointing.
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,audience,I’m glad I had a free ticket. Not sure what I learned from this. 
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,audience,"Having been an avid fan since the 80’s this gem of an historic film not only allowed me to re-live the concerts I attended but also filled in so many blanks. You must see it if you want to understand the roots she drew upon to deliver the iconic performances we loved, and her respect for her fans."
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,audience,"As a concert film, this offering works well. But, as a documentary about its subject, it comes up lacking, presenting only smatterings of insight into what makes Grace Jones the person and artist she is. What's more, the film feels padded, including considerable incidental (and largely insignificant) material to fill out its runtime, which is, in itself, overlong and in need of editing. A missed opportunity, to be sure."
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,audience,directionless and meandering.
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,critic,"
How do you demystify someone without sacrificing all the enigma and mystery around the subject? Sophie Fiennes, documentarian extraordinaire just does that with one of the most iconic figure in fashion and music, Grace Jones.
 "
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,critic,"
Sophie Fiennes' documentary eschews chronicling her fabled career to date of mixing recent concert performances with footage of this colorfully assertive personality simply going about her regular globe-trotting business.

It's an undeniably impactful and impressively put together work about a rarified human being, who I am now eager to learn more about.

Grace Jones is a fabulous act, far more than the sum of her over-the-top costumes, hairstyles and stage sets.

Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami is a fascinating watch about a fascinating human who just takes the lead and runs away with it here.
 "
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,critic,"
The offstage sequences can be revealing - in one scene, Jones recalls the abusive step-grandfather who inspired her aggressive musical persona- but director Sophie Fiennes sets such a languid pace that the songs can't come soon enough.
 "
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,critic,"
It's so dense and yet somehow incomplete-as though we're watching the abridged theatrical version of a ten part series.
 "
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,critic,"
[Director Sophie] Fiennes' unconventional film is far less concerned with the story of Grace Jones than with the person that is Grace Jones - and it is a treat to get to spend two hours with her.
 "
Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,critic,"
More personal diary than history lesson, this woozy doc oscillates between scenes of public performances and private conversations, offering greater insight into Jones' work ethic and family history... The late Jonathan Demme would have been proud.

Approach this film with an open mind and prepare for it to get blown away by the wildly wonderful Grace Jones.

Loose, energetic and revealing - and really, nothing else could've captured Jones' distinctive persona.

You can't deny talent, and Fiennes delivers a front row look at a force of nature that is raw and powerful.

[It] includes both concert footage and an examination of the private woman behind the flamboyant stage performer.

Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,86,37,critic,"
Fiennes provides a meandering observation of the woman behind the glamazon, disco diva and full-throated and furious singer/performance artist in this unstructured doc.

Still, the sight of the ominously androgynous floating fortress with legs to spare in her civvies alone is worth the price of admission.

It is frustrating at times, even meandering, yet it captures Jones' appeal with terrific performances and shrewd editing.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",90,87,audience,"Good, but not as good as the Coen Bros films it tries to imitate"
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",90,87,audience,"Maybe the best film I've ever seen. The visual cinematography will blow you away. The screenplay tackles dark topics directly but is, surprisingly, able to balance it and leave you feeling light with wit, humor, and charmingly complex characters. A brilliant lead heroine, incredible acting, and complex characters with compelling character arcs. Any American will be able to relate to this film."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",90,87,audience,"Powerful movie, great performances of all actors involved, I really enjoyed it!"
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",90,87,audience,"2021-3-3 Sheriff Willoughby killed himself and left 3 letters. One  for Mildred who was not very happy  about him. The other one for Dixon which really turned him to a decent person. Anger begets greater anger. Yeah, and very tiring actually. But I think when you were in anger, you wouldn't know it was also  painful until you got a hint and starting to forgive and let go. And  then you finally felt released. It's  too tiring to be in anger as much longer as you want."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",90,87,audience,"So the best way to watch this movie is to not know what it's about — it's one of those that's best served unknown and just let the film take you for the ride. All you need to know is that it's got a dream cast of Francis McDormand, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell. All three of these actors are top notch, and I'll go out o my way to see a most movies that any of these three are billed in. 

Also, this is the most Coen Brothers' movie that the Coen Brothers didn't make. It clearly pulls a TON of inspiration from the likes of Big Lebowski, No Country for Old Men, and especially Fargo, just without the snow. 

I love Francis McDormand. She's easily one of my top three favorite actresses of all time, and this just might be my favorite role of hers. She plays a hardened and grieving mother who lost her daughter to a murder/rape. And throughout the whole movie, you can see her pain, but also her anger. And all she has to live for is to see justice brought down on whoever committed the crime against her poor young daughter. 

And it's the type of film that's filled with colorful characters who are all connected to this tragedy in one way or another. And it's also the kind of movie where no one in particular is the bad guy. I mean, Sam Rockwell does play a loose cannon of a cop, but as Woody Harrelson, as the chief, keeps saying, he's a good guy at heart. Now, I love this movie, but there's no proof or byline that actually suggests that Dixon is good in any way. 

Throughout the movie he proves to be a racist buffoon who fights unfairly and just has a big chip on his shoulder. He does some things in this movie that in real life, he would have been arrest for, yet he gets discharged for a very small offense. So that would be my problem with the movie, is that it's not consistent with the Sam Rockwell's character of Dixon. 

Don't get me wrong, Rockwell is great in his role. He convinces me that he really is a lowlife who needs to be socked in the teeth, but I feel like he's written too conveniently to help the story along where it needs to go. 

Now, despite there being a dark shadow looming over this movie, what with the rape and murder of Mildred's daughter and Chief Willouby's terminal cancer, and the personal pain that every character is dealing with in their own lives, it's still a funny movie. There are unexpected punchlines, and brilliant comedic timing. And perhaps that's WHY the jokes work in this movie, because they contrast so much with the otherwise dour mood of this film. 

There's a scene where Mildred, Frances McDormand, walks into her house and she's all, ""Hey, Robbie, I think that midget wants to get in my pants. Father Montgomery."" And there's the priest sitting in her kitchen. Her line delivery and shock was just perfect. 

Woody Harrelson as the police chief, is just great as usual. He plays it both tough and friendly. He finds such a great balance, especially while his character is dealing with dying soon and his good name being being borderline slandered because of what's written on the billboards. 

Again, there's no real antagonists in this movie, and usually when a movie is devoid of antagonists, that means that it's got complex characters in its place, and that's exactly what this movie has. These are usually the best types of movies, because complex characters, like real people, are often unpredictable, and unpredictability goes a long way in making a great movie. 

And because this is a better movie than most, it even goes into the backstory of Mildred's failed marriage, and she comes face-to-face with her abusive husband who's dealing with his grief in his own way by driving fancy cars and banging 19 year olds.

I'm not ashamed to admit, I relate to Mildred. Thankfully I haven't lost a child, but life has turned me against people and made me calloused in a lot of ways. I'm not as outspoken as her, or as condescending, but she really has a tender heart. She flips a cockroach over that's stuck on its back, she admires the beauty and purity of a wandering deer in the field and she talks to it. 

I'm usually cranky most days because I'm not where I thought I'd be in my life. I'm working on it, but yeah, I've got anger issues. However, I'll bring home lost kittens and swerve out of the way of a bird in the road. My daughter and I buried a dead mole we found outside just a few weeks ago. 

So yeah, I related to Mildred. And I think everyone will find a character to relate to in this movie, that's how diverse the characters are. 

Now, as great of an actor as Woody Harrelson is, I don't think he does voice over very well. After he kills himself the rest of the movie sort of relies on him reading his separate suicide notes to each person in his life, and he has no inflection or charisma in his voice. It's as though he got mad that he wasn't in the rest of the movie, and he didn't want to be relegated to just a voice, so he didn't put much effort into it. That's just a little nitpick, nothing major. 

And you know who's a delight in this movie? Peter Dinklage! Yes, he's in this. Now, I don't watch Game of Thrones, but I loved him in Elf. And he brings so much charm and humor to this movie. His last line delivery is so emotional and raw, that he comes dangerously close to outshining the his three costars. 

Fun side note. I worked with and became pretty good friends with a guy who roomed with Peter Dinklage when he lived in New York jumping from audition to audition. My friend talked about Pete saying that he worked hard, hardly ever slept, and never gave up until he made it. I think that's really cool that he knew someone before he became a super mega star. And I think it's even cooler that a mega star like Peter Dinklage still showed up for an almost thankless role in this movie, but you've got to wonder if even he saw how great it was by reading the script. 

Now this movie has the most ambiguous of endings. It's no mystery, per say, but it just sort of ends before the grand adventure begins. I know there won't be a sequel, but I would have loved to get another 25 minutes where we got to see Mildred and Dixon hunt down the rapist together. 

And if there were a sequel, I'm sure it would be about the aftermath of Mildred and Dixon murdering the rapist in Idaho and his family would demand their arrest, and that movie would be called Three Billboards Outside McCall, Idaho. 

But I'm not going to be bemoan an ambiguous ending — I'll leave that for everyone else. Because this movie was good enough as is. We should be so lucky that a movie this simple, yet great is in existence. 


And now it's time to rate this movie. I think it's pretty clear that I'm going to give this a very high rating. So far I haven't loved, or really even liked any of the movies I've reviewed for Should You Watch It?, but even if I'd been watching movies that I love, this would still rank significantly high. Now keep in mind that as I rank more movies, the scale will grow from 1-10 to 1-20 and so on. But as of now, until I come across something that's even better than this, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri gets the top slot at first place. I'm rating it a 1.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",90,87,audience,"My rating is mostly if not completely for Frances McDormand's impeccable performance. This is definitely a thought-provoking movie, but maybe not exactly in a good sense. The more you think about it the more you realize its flaws, plot holes, and the many, many ways in which it could've been better, including but not limited to the shallow, cop-out ending, the boring and generic score, and the much-controversial ""redemption narrative"" of one of the characters. All anchored by a terrific lead performance."

To the Bone,71,64,audience,"Film che tratta il delicato tema dell'anoressia in maniera garbata e attenta, con una certa sensibilità, rappresenta l'esordio alla regia della sceneggiatrice Marti Noxon, e tutta la pellicola beneficia del tocco molto femminile nel mettere in scena il racconto.

Dal punto di vista della sceneggiatura la pellicola è molto curata, il ritmo è sostenuto e in più di un'occasione c'è un certo coinvolgimento emotivo per lo spettatore. 
C'è una generale attenzione verso i dialoghi, anche se capitano talvolta frasi ""banali"" in situazioni delicate. In tal senso, è intelligente la scelta della regista/sceneggiatrice di risolverle (piuttosto che evitarle) evidenziandone il rigetto da parte della stessa protagonista che le condanna esplicitamente.
Nonostante ciò, alcuni dialoghi non convincono fino in fondo (nello specifico alcuni in cui è coinvolto il medico).

Ellen è una ragazza anoressica con una famiglia sgangherata. I suoi genitori sono separati, in particolare la madre vive una relazione omosessuale e il padre si è risposato con una donna logorroica e disattenta, con la quale ha avuto una figlia che ha molto legato con Ellen.
Il nucleo familiare alla base delle vicende di Ellen dà un po' la percezione di essere ispirato a una situazione autobiografica, ed effettivamente scavando nella storia personale della Noxon si riscontrano dei parallelismi.

Elemento comune tra le due famiglie rappresentate è la ""presenza dell'assenza"" del padre, che spicca in entrambi i contesti familiari come costante. 
L'uomo non si vedrà mai nell'arco dell'intera pellicola.

Questo è un elemento interessante che si configura come il principale elemento di instabilità e disagio, innesco dei problemi di Ellen, 
nonchè un più o meno esplicito atto d'accusa nei riguardi della figura maschile.

Anche il bel medico darà durante lo svolgimento della storia l'impressione di disinteressarsi di Ellen (questa almeno la percezione della protagonista), 
ma questo si rivelerà essere un atto consapevole e volontario (un vero e proprio atto d'amore a distanza, rischioso, ma necessario e rispettoso e dunque ""riabilitante"" per la figura maschile), escamotage per consentire alla protagonista di toccare il proprio fondo (fisico e spirituale) prima di incominciare la rinascita.

La ragazza, una volta giunta ad una condizione fisica allarmante, viene infatti portata da un medico famoso per i suoi metodi non convenzionali (Keanu Reeves) ed inizia un percorso di recupero all'interno di una casa che ospita una comunità di ragazzi con problemi analoghi, 
che vengono lasciati abbastanza liberi di decidere cosa e quanto mangiare, limitando però le uscite e l'uso della tecnologia in modo tale da essere portati a conversare e legare tra loro.
Pian piano si sentirà sempre più parte di questa famiglia acquisita, addirittura deciderà di cambiare il suo nome in Ellie (a rimarcare la reale voglia di un cambiamento nella sua attuale vita) e il suo carattere difficile lascerà più spazio ai rapporti umani.
Addirittura troverà l'amore (interessante come il ragazzo in questione, ballerino, abbia atteggiamenti e una grazia vagamente femminili).

Non riuscendo però inizialmente a vedere risultati della vita in comunità, sentendosi abbandonata dal medico che la segue e incompresa dagli altri ragazzi, Ellen deciderà di abbandonare la casa e lasciarsi scivolare verso il baratro personale, dimagrendo a vista d'occhio.
Ormai allo stremo delle forze, viene ospitata nella tenuta della madre e la compagna, dove si svolgono le scene più potenti della pellicola, ben curate dal punto di vista fotografico.

In un momento di sconforto totale, sua madre le rivela di essere pronta ad accettare qualsiasi sua decisione, anche quella di lasciarsi morire in maniera consapevole e risoluta.
Questa profonda e insospettata comprensione le riavvicina, e fa sì che vada a buon fine l'ultimo disperato tentativo di una madre che si sente colpevole ed emotivamente annientata dal veder morire la figlia sotto i propri occhi: le propone di nutrirla, attraverso un biberon come fosse una neonata, per ritrovare la perduta connessione primordiale con la genitrice.
 
E' questo estremo atto di riconciliazione e comprensione a riavvicinare le due donne, con Ellen che in grembo alla sua vera madre che si lascia cullare mentre si nutre. La telecamera lentamente si allontana ad inquadrare l'uscio della porta del gazebo che, con la luce 
proveniente dalla stanza, forma la sagoma inequivocabile di una casa. 
Evidente il richiamo alla classica rappresentazione dela sacra famiglia, con la differenza che si nota prepotentemente la mancanza del padre. 
Questa scelta stilistica è potente ed espressiva, e sottende molti significati: amore materno come rinascita, come nutrimento per corpo e spirito, comprensione intensa che porta la ragazza a svegliarsi nel cuore della notte e a scalare difficoltosamente una metaforica collina per addormentarsi poi sulla nuda terra sotto le stelle. 

Durante il sonno la ragazza si vede felice in cima a un albero, radiosa e splendente in compagnia del ragazzo che ha conosciuto, che al tempo stesso le fa notare ai piedi del tronco il suo corpo spossato e martoriato dalla debolezza.
E' in questo momento che Ellen capisce cosa sta perdendo, a cosa sta rinunciando lasciandosi scivolare e cosa potrebbe ottenere se decidesse invece di riprendere il controllo della propria vita.

Decide dunque di tornare alla comunità, presso cui si reca indossando lo stesso abito bianco indossato dalla versione serena di sè sognata, a simboleggiare quanto stavolta sia davvero pronta ad affrontare il percorso di riabilitazione fisica e spirituale."
To the Bone,71,64,audience,"Amazing, the best movie about anorexia I've ever seen. I was crying so hard"
To the Bone,71,64,audience,"This movie is SO relatable to this person who has suffered with eating disordered thoughts and then behaviors since age 7 but how THE FUCK could makers who've experienced EDs produce content where no one recovers? I cried a lot and had to take a break during that fucked milk bottle scene, but the ending completely fucked me over while i'm finally wondering if this c l i n i c a l l y obese (EDNOS/bulimic/wtf ever) can stand inpatient treatment with extremely triggering thin and/or healthy bodies.

Also, why are there ZERO ED questionnaires for people whose BMI/weight indicate they are ACTUALLY fat, this has been a problem for me for like 1/3 of my 32 year old life. That's like 20 years if you don't feel like doing the math"
To the Bone,71,64,audience,Such a beautiful movie showing the fight agains this horrible disorder
To the Bone,71,64,audience,"An insightful, empathetic, rewarding, realistic, sincere, thoughtful and hard to watch exploration of mental health and eating disorders, that successfully overcomes its flaws and uneven plotting by bringing a moralistic, compelling and cautionary narrative, anchored by a charismatic lead performance from Lily Collins."
To the Bone,71,64,audience,"It's good that a movie is spreading awareness on a mental health disorder. Yet, I thought that the movie was a bit superficial.
I did not know a lot about Eli, her connections, her past, her thoughts. What made her stop eating, what does she feel when she eats or not eat. Why does not she have friends? What does her relationship with food look like. What about the other residents. We did not see  anything that could present an education about the disorder. I was looking for something deeper that could present something valuable about eating disorders. It did not. I was not hooked and one could forget about the movie few hours after watching it."
To the Bone,71,64,audience,"Anorexia is a hard subject to talk about, just like any mental illness. Or any illness for the matter, i think its because people always expect life to be ""perfect"". Perfection in life, sadly, doesn't exist. However, perfection does exist in the directing and production and acting of this movie. This might be one of the best movies made addressing illnesses in general."
To the Bone,71,64,audience,"Lily Collins gives a masterful performance as you really go on a journey with her to try and understand how her family life, self image and her mental condition has shaped her life to the point she's close to rock bottom. She ends up living in a home with 4 other girls and 1 boy led by an unconventional doctor played by Keanu Reeves.  While this movie takes on a very difficult concept and at times is a little disturbing, it moves at a nice pace and has well timed comedy relief. I didn't expect much going into this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised and I highly recommend this movie."

To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
Marti Noxon's dramedy falls prey to the old AF story of wise male savior rescuing troubled girl.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
To the Bone is a phenomenal film because it confronts the pain endured by those with eating disorders and doesn't hide it.
 "

To the Bone will provide inspiration that is only one click away.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
A laudable, affecting piece of drama that could prove useful for any viewer struggling at the moment, whether with an eating disorder or any other mental health issue.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
Noxon's film is scarily realistic and worms its way under your skin. Collins is excellent as Ellen but I was very, very uncomfortable watching her (and by my own unexpected desire to know the numbers at Ellen's every weigh-in).
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
It is a credit to Noxon and the cast that To the Bone works as well as it does, considering the delicate subject matter.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
IN no way does this movie glamourise anorexia or thinness; it is clear about Ellen's struggles, and also shows how an eating disorder can change a family dynamic and disrupt lives of the patient and those around her. Still, it's funny, sly and moving.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
Lily Collins in particular delivers a strong performance and the supporting cast is wonderful.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
Director James Mangold saved the best for last with this uncompromising, brutal and heartfelt story of a fallen hero stumbling to get back up again.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
The only thing more interesting than watching how someone turns into a superhero is seeing them lose that power.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
Collins' appearance is the most shocking thing in this quite-conventional, inconclusive look at eating disorders and their treatment.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
A good movie about an important topic, but it peters out a bit at the end. We care about Ellen and we wish her well. But, it would have been more interesting to watch her get well.

To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
A missed opportunity despite a remarkable Lily Collins. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
The story of Ellen won't be everyone's story, but it is still effectively wielded to shed a harsh light on the way we seek to ascribe meaning to the illnesses of others.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
Movies take us anywhere we want to go. But movies can also take us places we need to go, even though we'd rather not. That's the space Marti Noxon's directorial debut, To the Bone, lives in.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
While To The Bone's dramatic strength lies in its first-hand immediacy, the meandering tale fails to engage.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
. . .the plot veers into romance and gets derailed as Ellen attracts the attention of Luke (Alex Sharp), a dancer with a career-ending injury.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
Through conspicuous examples and only slightly stilted exposition, To the Bone educates us on the ins and outs of the diagnosis.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
Ultimately , To The Bone is the kind of film that will either resonate with you deeply or not even register.
 "
To the Bone,71,64,critic,"
To The Bone had the chance to inspire understanding of anorexia, but ended up being a disappointment.

Compelling as its subjects are -- Medgar Evers, MLK and Malcolm X -- James Baldwin is the powerhouse who makes ""I Am Not Your Negro"" the best film I've ever seen on the subject. In fact, it's easily one of the best documentaries, period."
I Am Not Your Negro,99,83,critic,"
With no talking heads Peck relies on news footage, movie clips and archival talk show tape, intercutting them with the fluidity of jazz. Posters and graphics punctuate the narration, subliminally driving home Baldwin's points.
 "
I Am Not Your Negro,99,83,critic,"
It's an undeniably excellent film and a much-needed tribute to both Baldwin and the racial politics of the 1960s and ʼ70s... The only shortcoming of Peck's film is its almost complete erasure of Baldwin's homosexuality.

I Am Not Your Negro is montage and meditation, a dialogue between the archive and the present, a road movie without the road.

Baldwin's breakdown of why groups in power behave the way they do, Peck's stunning imagery, and Samuel L. Jackson's reserved narration open the door to a more hopeful future of equality.

This documentary, based on Baldwin's unfinished Remember This House manuscript, offers a view of the United States as disturbingly relevant today as it was in the late 1970s.

James Baldwin is exactly the right discursive proxy for this film's balance between history lesson and impressionistic treatise on the African-American experience.

The continual vibrancy of Baldwin's ideas is underscored by Peck's intricate consideration of every frame of film.

Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,audience,"Holy crap. I was expecting a nostalgia trip, not a full-on smack in the face of the new generation being a new generation! While I would have loved to have seen more things that were recognizable from the original series, it was still pretty ding-dang-darn good!"
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,audience,"I liked this film but good have been better. the main problem I have with it is they don't become power Rangers until the final battle and when they do, they have 1 minute with their masks on before they take them off. That being said, the action is very good and it could really do with a sequal."
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,audience,"A pleasant reboot for who approaches the Power Rangers for first time. Good movie overall, with a few incongruences in the screenplay. Good music choices and VFX"
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,audience,Sure it might not be good but this is a fun movie to watch I love the characters and it's funny especially the Chrispy creme Jokes.
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,audience,"Firstly, I am the guy that finds the beauty in most movies. I appreciate Batman and Robin for being fun and almost comics like albeit boring. I didn't mind The Fantastic Four reboot because I found it interesting in the manner they attempted to redirect the background of the franchise, while understandably being dull. This movie however was just horrible and a slap in the face to all hardcore Power Ranger fans. It was a long drawn out movie trailer ( because EVERY ""interesting "" part of the plot or action that we may have been looking forward to exploring was already seen in the trailers). I felt bad for the actors because some of them are actually really good in other projects they took part in, but this was probably something they did because they owed some favors. Or were being blackmailed. The suits were horrible, the Megazord was crap and we didn't actually see them full force in costume until the last thirty minutes. TURBO FORCE was better than this and THE MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS movie featuring Ivan Ooze double crossing Rita Repulsa and Lord Zed towers over this movie."
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,audience,"Underrated movie. It's the original power rangers but in modern times, so no more new class or anything. Jason, Kimberly, Zack, Billy and Trini are all there along with Rita Repulsa and Goldar. Fans of the original Power Rangers will love all the references. It's a shame the marketing for the film was so bad. It should have been bigger than it was."

It was so boring and I didn't expect that.

Power Rangers is what happens if The Breakfast Club and Transformers had a baby and then let Pacific Rim raise it.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
Sadly, in this, the third Power Rangers movie, the crass exploitation is in full effect, but the anything-goes spirit is nowhere to be found.

Be ready to be intrigued by a bunch of kids then bored and confused by a conclusion that somehow took two hours to get to.

Unfortunately, director Dean Israelite shies away from everything that made the franchise great.

The bright moments ultimately win out for ""Power Rangers."" When the movie is fun, it's unapologetically so.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
[T]the big ticket aspect of POWER RANGERS are the visuals. Incredible set pieces. Outrageous stunt work. Fight choreography soars - literally and figuratively. Meticulous and eye-popping blend of production design, CGI, VFX and SFX.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
I'll take a movie that is genuinely interested in its characters and not as much in whatever an army of computer technicians can conjure. Call this one a flawed but good start.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
People who were kids of the 90s will rush to the theater for the nostalgia of one of their favorite television shows...for many others who didn't grow up with it, it has no sense of connection to them.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
Power Rangers has diversity in sexuality and race; is secure in its silliness; demonstrates fantastic pacing; places emphasis on its heroes and leads and not supporting cast or villains and feels light and kinetic even when trying to be serious.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
That's part of what makes [it] so deeply entertaining - its refusal to be a gritty, serious-minded take on something so ridiculous, and its equally admirable refusal to condescend to that same material.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
The story comes across as dutiful and buckles with a cast that though winsome never seems particularly united.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
It doesn't overstay its welcome like the Transformers movies and it keeps the fan service from being distracting.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
A worthy effort at updating a '90s cult classic, Power Rangers subtly mixes up some of the character stereotypes and offers an enjoyably action-packed ride.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
There's something about this superpowered Breakfast Club that I kind of enjoyed ... even if I wouldn't go so far as to call it good.
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
A fun reboot of a now-classic franchise
 "
Saban's Power Rangers,50,65,critic,"
It takes what was enjoyable about the concept of Power Rangers and dials all those elements up five hundred percent.

Julieta,83,74,audience,"Really underrated, kind of a weird film tho"
Julieta,83,74,audience,"This is Pedro Almodóvar in his most minor key, a melancholy tale of a woman who by chance meets a childhood friend of her estranged daughter - and who then decides to write to her, telling her much she didn't know that we as viewers see in flashback. It's a tender, moving story with threads running through it - not least the colour red, but more subtly the sense of clarity emerging through some kind of mist or distortion as the mother discovers as much truth about herself as she's passing on to her daughter about their own relationship. The conclusion is graceful and quietly eloquent, befitting a film that isn't among the director's very best but still deeply satisfying."
Julieta,83,74,audience,Pedro Almodóvar exercises much restraint in coalescing a triptych of Alice Munro short stories about a woman on the verge of excessive guilt breakdown to realise a more profound poignancy and deliverance.
Julieta,83,74,audience,"Not Almodovar's finest, but an entertaining Hitchcock melodrama. A la Vertigo and Rebecca, this is a swirling family melodrama. Full of flashbacks, jarring plot twists and a Herrmannesque score.

This is a story of a family coming apart. There is guilt, misunderstanding and betrayal. Almodovar tackles it with his calling card flamboyance, using plenty of strident red in the colour palette."
Julieta,83,74,audience,"It is difficult to explain how this can be rigid, conventional and pretentious at the same time "
Julieta,83,74,audience,"O diretor possui um estÃ­lo bem especÃ­fico e, neste filme, ele o mantÃ (C)m. Continuo achando algo ""mais do mesmo"", mas provavelmente a explicaÃ§Ã£o se dÃ¡ no fato de eu ver todos seus filmes em sequÃªncia. Ainda assim, posso dizer que Ã (C) um filme bacana para quem curte AlmodÃ³var, do contrÃ¡rio, pode acabar se decepcionando por nÃ£o trazer algo formidÃ¡vel. O filme trata muito bem da DepressÃ£o, mas neste ponto friso que nÃ£o Ã (C) o inÃ­cio nem o fim, mas o durante. Isto Ã (C), a personagem principal lida com a DepressÃ£o e todas as nuances que esta pode atingir sua vida e, (nisso o diretor faz muito bem) em demonstrar como o tema amor estÃ¡ ligado diretamente no desenvolvimento da personagem.
Elogios: gostei do modo como as paisagens sÃ£o retratadas e cenas lindas com cores vivas, isto ajudou muito para balancear a depressÃ£o da personagem e dar ao filme um olhar de superaÃ§Ã£o (ou talvez redenÃ§Ã£o da Julieta) e nÃ£o um constante pessimista e deveras melancÃ³lica.

CrÃ­tica: [spoiler]nÃ£o costumo fazer muito este tipo de comentÃ¡rio, mas neste caso o final foi bem incompleto. Ao menos poderia ter deixado pistas para o espectador poder divagar e atÃ (C) fazer conjecturas sobre o destino das personagens.[/spoiler]"
Julieta,83,74,audience,"El curioso Almodovar se presenta como orador en una historia Familiar vibrante y conmovedora,Que deja una eficaz actuacion de Emma Suarez en un rol desgarrador y frustrante,Sin duda La madurez de Almodovar es mas melancolico y dramatica que cualquier otra cosa una conclusion inteligente para Su historia envolvente."
Julieta,83,74,audience,"It's been a while since I peeped a film from my favorite Spanish director. Julieta is thinking back at her life. It has ups, but mostly downs. Things grind on her and she let them grind for a long time. It's not easy to come over loss when new sad things keep on coming. 

The film shows us how she tries to cope, with all her relations involved.
A very typica Pedro AlmodÃ³var movie, featuring very Spanish sex, hospitals and life problems. It's very seducive as it keeps your interest during the entire playtime. Grief and loss is not a new theme for this man, and while it's pretty gently presented here, it's almost always vital.

I like the performances, the score and the pace. Still it's not his best work, but it's solid and enjoyable for most.

7 out of 10 birthday cakes."
Julieta,83,74,audience,A pedestrian plot remains engaging and entertaining throughout due to the quality of the film itself.
Julieta,83,74,audience,"Julieta Arcos (Emma Suárez) lives in Madrid and is about to move to Portugal with her boyfriend Lorenzo (Darío Grandinetti). In a chance encounter on the street with her daughter Antía's (Priscilla Delgado) childhood friend Beatriz (Michelle Jenner), she learns that Antía, from whom she has long been estranged, is living in Switzerland and has three children. Overcome by her desire to reestablish contact with Antía, she abandons plans to leave Spain and instead leases an apartment elsewhere in the building in Madrid where she raised Antía, knowing that address is Antía's only means of contacting her. Anticipating word from Antía, and aware that she owes her daughter an explanation of the events that led to their separation, Julieta fills a journal with an account of her life as mother, spouse, and daughter. She begins with the story of meeting Xoan (Daniel Grao), a fisherman and Antía's father. In a flashback, Julieta recounts meeting Xoan on a train, having fled to the restaurant carriage from an older man. He tells her about his life as a fisherman, and his wife who is in a coma. The train stops sharply, having hit the older man, who committed suicide. As Julieta blames herself for his death, Xoan comforts her, and they have sex on the train. Later, at the school at which she works, Julieta receives a letter from Xoan which she takes as an invitation to visit. She learns his wife has recently died and that he is with Ava, a friend. Julieta and Xoan resume their relationship, and she informs him that she is pregnant with his child. Two years later, Julieta and Antía visit Julieta's parents. Her mother is ill and apparently suffering from Alzheimer's disease, at first not recognising her daughter. Her father is having an affair with the maid, to Julieta's chagrin. While an older Antía is at a summer camp, Xoan and Julieta argue over his occasional dalliances with Ava, prompted by the housekeeper. Julieta storms out to walk and Xoan goes fishing. A storm rolls in and, as Julieta watches the news in panic, Xoan is killed. At camp, Antía has become inseparable with a girl named Beatriz. Julieta travels to Madrid to break the news of Xoan's death to her daughter, and rents a flat there. At the age of 18, Antía embarks on a spiritual retreat and announces that she will be incommunicado for three months. When Julieta drives to the location of the retreat in the Pyrenees three months later, she is informed that her daughter has already left, and does not want her location disclosed to her mother...

The film opened on 8 April 2016 in Spain to generally positive reviews. It made its international debut at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, where it was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or, and was released across the world throughout the remainder of 2016. Julieta has grossed over $22 million worldwide. It was selected by the Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematográficas de España as the Spanish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards, but did not make the shortlist. It was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language in addition to receiving 4 nominations for European Film Awards and 7 nominations for Goya Awards. Reviews for Julieta were generally favourable and much less critical than those Almodóvar received for his previous film ""I'm So Excited"" (2013).

The film drew praise from critics in Spain, including La Vanguardia, who compared Julieta to the female-centric films of George Cukor and Kenji Mizoguchi while noting hints of Alfred Hitchcock in Almodóvar's screenplay. Alfonso Rivera of Cineuropa additionally observed influences of Ingmar Bergman, Krzysztof Kie?lowski and Douglas Sirk in Almodóvar's style. Vicente Molina Fox from El País believed Almodóvar had achieved the best script of his career with Julieta, while Luis Martínez of El Mundo, despite finding issues with the narrative, thought Julieta was Almodóvar's ""most difficult and most pure film"". The Spanish edition of Vanity Fair also called it ""the most Almodóvar film by Almodóvar"". Quim Casas from El Periódico de Catalunya said that Almodóvar had reinvented melodrama: ""Prodigious in dramatic tone, Julieta is very Almodóvarian but at the same time different to other works by the auteur"". ABC gave the film a mixed review; praising Suárez in the lead role but criticising narrative choices. Carlos Boyero (es), the ""sworn critical enemy"" of Almodóvar, penned an extremely negative review in El País, feeling distanced and unable to identify with the characters because of the film's style and cinematography. Boyero stated that ""the film conveys nothing to me, either emotionally or artistically"". El Confidencial also responded negatively, calling the film ""a barren drama"", ""unsubtle"" and ""self-indulgent"". Julieta had a warm reception at the Cannes Film Festival, which was followed by extremely positive reactions from French film critics. According to AlloCiné, based on 29 reviews from critics in France, Julieta received an average rating of 4.4 out of 5, making it one of the best reviewed films released in France in 2016. Numerous sources such as Cahiers du Cinéma, Le Monde, Positif, Ouest-France and Le Parisien gave the film their highest five-star rating. Le Monde called it ""a beautiful film of very pure sadness"" and La Croix who thought the theme of guilt was a welcome new addition to Almodóvar's work, calling Julieta ""a beautiful and intense film"". L'Express thought Almodóvar had returned to the top of his game with Julieta, calling it ""a work constantly on the edge, never overwhelmed by its own emotions, deliberately cold [and] even austere"". Libération gave a positive review, but felt the film was ""too well-oiled"" which prevented the drama of the story from ""truly expressing all its power of emotional attraction"". However, L'Humanité was largely negative, concluding that ""the film is very narrative and severely short of breath"".

The British press were very positive about the film: Screen Daily labelled the film ""an anxious, tantalising creature which returns the Spanish director to the exclusive world of women"" and stated that Almodóvar's ""distinctive voice [grows] in texture and depth with each new production"". Empire also responded very positively, calling the film ""a celebration of elegance and good living as well as motherly love and romance"". Time Out singled out the cinematography, design, costumes and Iglesias' score as ""typically exquisite"", concluding that: ""It might be familiar territory for Almodóvar, but only a master of his art could make it look so easy"". The Daily Telegraph called the film a ""guilt-soaked pleasure"" and also highlighted its score and cinematography as well as the performances of Suárez and Ugarte. London Evening Standard labelled the film ""a harrowing examination of broken maternity and ever-present mortality"", stating that the film is ""excellently acted, brightly filmed [and] seriously good"". Gay Star News highlighted the ""visually resplendent"" cinematography and ""sensitive"" acting performances, concluding that ""all the Almodóvar trademarks are here, and he's as flamboyant and fun as ever - but there's a seriousness to this familial drama that's as compelling as it is deeply satisfying"". The Guardian thought the film was a ""fluent and engaging work"", stating that ""the colours - and the women - pop in the Spanish auteur's adaptation of three Alice Munro stories, but there's something intentionally unsatisfying at the heart of this minor work"". Sight & Sound felt Almodóvar had ""play[ed] it straighter than usual"" and felt a disconnect between the visual and the emotional elements, which undermined the ""nuanced realism"" of the two lead performances, calling the film ""a surprisingly flat offering from Spain's most vibrant auteur"". The Spectator also felt that ""the gloss ends up cramping the story"" and concluded that ""the film could have used more of the classic Almodóvar weirdness"".

American critics tended to have more mixed feelings, like Collider.com, who called the film ""an engaging yet uneven meldodrama"", and Variety, who stated that while the film was ""a welcome return to the female-centric storytelling that has earned Almodóvar his greatest acclaim, it is far from this reformed renegade's strongest or most entertaining work"". Similarly mixed, Slant Magazine thought Julieta was not one of Almodóvar's best films, but most compelling because of ""the bold, colorful compositions and framings that [he] has long mastered, which sketch psychological detail more acutely than Julieta's methodically orchestrated and rather sluggish story"". Twitch Film felt the mellowness of Munro's work did not adapt well to Almodóvar's melodramatic style, concluding that ""Almodóvar seems content to let his past strengths wither in favour of banality"". Indiewire also thought the director played too safe and called Julieta his most conventional film. The Hollywood Reporter felt the film would satisfy fans of Almodóvar, but was too decorous in comparison to his previous films: ""a politeness that's quite unlike the lusty vulgarity of the past. Some of us may not be sure we like it"". However, TheWrap thought that ""a subdued Almodóvar is still a far sight weirder and more intriguing than most directors"", adding that the film is ""a worthy part of a canon in which decorous should never be confused with dull"".

""Julieta"" is hardly amongst Almodovar´s best in my opinion. I can´t really understand the raving reviews. Almodovar builds up the story with a Hitchcock thriller vibe and feeling that ends up in nothing to be honest. The ending is extremely anticlimatic in my point of view. I think the script is underdeveloped and not exciting enough. It´s like opening a Kinder egg and there´s no toy. Almodovar has said in an interview that ""Julieta"" may represent the beginning of a new stage for him, in which he replaces the extravagance that he's best known for with a drier, more austere tone. Then I would say that he will stear away from what he knows best. His trademark. And if he thinks that ""Julieta"" truly represent this new stage, then I will most likely not see his upcoming films."
Julieta,83,74,critic,"
Almodóvar's film, unhappily, does not add up to that much. It is overwrought, preoccupied with an upper middle class milieu, whose emotional vocabulary and behavior feel largely contrived.
 "
Julieta,83,74,critic,"
Even in our resolve, though, we are not in control. Julieta's story illustrates the ways in which we blindly revisit upon others the pain we have received in our lives.

I don't wish to spoil the surprises Julieta has to offer. Suffice to say the emotional punches are consistent and land more often than not.

Julieta,83,74,critic,"
Though we never find out if Julieta and Antía reconcile, a strong hope pervades and the cathartic release we long desire is just around the bend.

Is this a new direction for Pedro Almodóvar, who has made excess the hallmark of his long career?
 "
Julieta,83,74,critic,"
Julieta is paced quite well -- with Almodóvar slowly putting the pieces to this puzzle together. Even when the story sometimes veers a little too much into soap opera territory, Suarez's earnest performance pulls it all back together.
 "
Julieta,83,74,critic,"
[Almodóvar] continues to be a leading figure in telling women's stories, and pulls this one off with just enough majesty to keep you in its sway.
 "
Julieta,83,74,critic,"
Exploding off the screen in a blast of colour and compassion, Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar's Julieta is one of 2016's cinematic treasures.
 "
Julieta,83,74,critic,"
Compared to Almodóvar's grand masterpieces, his latest might seem quaint. But Julieta is a subtle force of nature, elementally connected with its lead character and her battle to regain personal and familial balance.
 "
Julieta,83,74,critic,"
Almodvar plants a foot on each side of the gap between the two [styles], which is fine, but the film, like Julieta herself, seems lost on the road.
 "

[An] increasingly rare cinema experience - a film that excites the senses, calms the heart, and stays with you for a long time afterwards. One to savour.
 "
Julieta,83,74,critic,"
Pedro Almodvar rebounds after a series of disappointments with Julieta, which reminds us of the Spanish writer-director's greatness.

The Carer,67,61,audience,"Although it seemed a little contrived, Cox stands out with a powerful performance that was both moving and nostalgic."
The Carer,67,61,audience,Every so often you find a diamond in the rough. This is one of those occasions. I say bravo. What a lovely movie. Not normally something I would choose but saw it and thought....why not. A surprisingly funny at times film. Don't look at the critic reviews on this one and make up your own mind.
The Carer,67,61,audience,A delightful film about overcoming some obstacles of youth and aging... (quote from IMDb)
The Carer,67,61,audience,If you are a Brian Cox fan then watch it...even he can barely carry the film...the girl is a horrible actress which is doubly funny since she plays a budding actress in the film.

Those who love Shakespeare and great British acting should not pass up The Carer.

It's only a small step from Scent of a Woman, but Cox elevates it with one of his strongest performances.
 "
The Carer,67,61,critic,"
It's a tired formula. But saving graces come from two fine performances, the criminally underrated Brian Cox as high-maintenance Sir Michael and newcomer Coco Konig as Dorottya, who's plucky, compassionate and wise.
 "
The Carer,67,61,critic,"
This slender piece about a famous actor begrudgingly accepting his young caregiver as he's gradually succumbing to Parkinson's is sentimental and doesn't care much about character backstory or development. But it's entertaining as hell.
 "
The Carer,67,61,critic,"
A simultaneously pretentious and amateurish luvviefest.

The Carer,67,61,critic,"
This is Cox's show, and he dives fully into the role of a cantankerous, hammy old thespian who isn't remotely ready to go gentle into that good night.

Cox's timing throughout is superb -- a comic masterclass that gives way to storms of temper worthy of Lear.
 "
The Carer,67,61,critic,"
The tale is almost as old as Sir Michael Gifford himself, and -- in this retelling -- one not short on those eccentricities common to the recent wave of country house cinema.
 "
The Carer,67,61,critic,"
The Carer actually turns out to be better than most iterations of this hoary old set-up. It is all because there is some lasting fizz to the two effervescent lead performances on display here.

A wonderful screenplay full of wit and brimstone drives this - I was going to write charming but it's much tougher than that - emotionally satisfying and dramatically satisfying comedy

Ben-Hur,25,53,audience,"For a person who has never seen the original, this movie is awesome. Not sure why the bad reviews. Which old farts want to watch a black and white production from 1959. For this generation it is a great story and my family enjoyed it very much. Just purchased it to watch again"
Ben-Hur,25,53,audience,This is a story that has been told several times in the history of the movies but they really should have stopped in 1959. This is a remake too far and so obviously tries to steal so of the thunder from Gladiator that in places it seems like direct plagiarism. Just don't bother.
Ben-Hur,25,53,audience,"Ben-Hur, done that. Although not totally agredious, the newest rendition of Ben-Hur does nothing to set itself apart and does little more than to satisfy the ever-thinning demographic of viewers still willing to go see watered down versions of the Gladiator and Troy."
Ben-Hur,25,53,audience,"Ben Hur of 2016 boasts great visuals in the boat scene, is a powerful film, and has a decent chariot race. But it doesn't live up to the one of the greatest films of all time, the original. However with the powerfulness and might in it, it is worth at least one watch."
Ben-Hur,25,53,audience,"What I have to say is this: In my opinion, Ben Hur of 1959 is muchhhh betterrrr, of course there are good things in this film, but this film was unnecessary at a generally weak level compared to 1959, that is, if  the 1959 film did not exist I would say that this film is good, to be honest i've seen remakes worse than this !!!"
Ben-Hur,25,53,audience,Terrible remake of the 1959 classic
Ben-Hur,25,53,audience,"Movie has something for everyone: action, romance, suspense, etc. It is a story of Good - Judas Ben Hur (Jew) vs Bad - Massala (Roman). It is a recommended watch!"
Ben-Hur,25,53,audience,"I fail to see where all the hatred for this is coming from. Is it as grand and epic as the original? No. But it's a fine updating of the classic story, with punchier editing. And a nice addition to the story that deals with themes of brotherhood and forgiveness. The voice Huston puts on halfway through is a bit much, but this is otherwise a decent watch."

It glosses over familiar scenes and motifs, going through the same old routine without bringing anything new to the table.
 "
Ben-Hur,25,53,critic,"
For a movie that wants so badly to be epic-regular swooping helicopter shots of long lines of people walking along some ridge or cliff pepper the film-Ben-Hur lacks any sense of majesty or grandeur.
 "
Ben-Hur,25,53,critic,"
Unfortunately, 'new interpretation' means changing the story dramatically and turning it into a slight rip off of Gladiator and we are not entertained.
 "

A spectacle worthy of Cecil B. DeMille but with a story that is more grounded and layered with softer, nuanced, more human emotional performances that go beyond the visual (and visceral) experience.

The movie isn't really saying anything, and is just cruising on the fumes left over from our associations with a classic.

The new film is like a cheap Chinese clone. Its slick to look at, but once you experience it first hand; you realize it is in essence a cheap knock-off.
 "
Ben-Hur,25,53,critic,"
Ben-Hur is dreadful to look at, so murky and dark at times, that it's difficult to know whether to blame the weather, a duff conversion to 3D or Oliver Wood's original cinematography.

"People, Places, Things",76,72,audience,An enjoyable dysfunctional family/romantic comedy. 
"People, Places, Things",76,72,audience,Charming indie flick. Jemaine Clement is great
"People, Places, Things",76,72,audience,Smart writing. Clement is effortlessly funny.
"People, Places, Things",76,72,audience,"Interesting at times,  but I could have safely passed on watching this one."
"People, Places, Things",76,72,audience,"Been a while since I watched this so a bit hard to remember everything. I remember Clement giving us a very likable character who is still struggling with heartbreak from his wife. It seemed like a pretty accurate portrayal of how hard it can be to move on. I'm sure the story has been told many times, but Clement brings that likability and it's just a nice watch."
"People, Places, Things",76,72,audience,That was a pretty damned cute movie.
"People, Places, Things",76,72,audience,A witty script that offers a rare perspective on a more realistic love story through comedic scenes and dramatic events. Jemaine Clement was phenomenal in his portrayal as a naive but softhearted father working to cope with his wife's infidelity. His character was the highlight of the movie and I very much enjoyed every minute of it.
"People, Places, Things",76,72,audience,"Much more of a better character study than its familiar counterparts. Way too often however, the writing falls apart and moves into pointless territory of useless conversation. If interested in similar genres I highly recommend watching ones like 'The Squid and the Whale'."
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
An absolutely delightful charmer!
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
People Places Things doesn't offer much in the way of satisfying resolution, instead just kind of petering out.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Strouse's ongoing emphasis on overly off-kilter instances of comedy and character development sometimes prevents the viewer from entirely embracing the material...
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Nominated for the Sundance Grand Jury Prize, the film has plenty of smart, witty lines, and Clement is the perfect actor to give them life.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Clement's predilection for center stage is real and actually kind of astounding, pole-vaulting James Strouse's low-key romantic comedy into something much sturdier.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Strouse has a built a career on small, personal stories, and this film is no different.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Clement is better-suited as a foil to Conchord-like absurdity, where it works as a droll counterweight.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Strouse offers a light treatment of a heavy situation. And the longer it goes, the deeper the sense of reality, the better the scenes. That's more than unusual. Most films get worse in the third act, not better.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
People Places Things is a mildly amusing observational comedy about relationships that has its droll moments.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
It's a witty, heartfelt and engaging film that's elevated by the performances.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Consistently funny, smart and poignant.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Clement is funny and touching as the heartbroken artist, and he and Hall have a sparkling chemistry.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Jemaine Clement is terrific, and there's a lot to admire, but the picture is subsumed by an inescapable aura of insubstantiality.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Gently funny and admirably, even unfashionably humane.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Who cares?
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
People, Places, Things manages to find a pocket within the genre that is light, hopeful, and likeable sans characters transforming into shrews or unredeemable jerks. It's good, and that's just fine.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
Strouse's script is so entertaining and Clement and supporting players give such endearing, heartfelt performances, relatable to denizens of Brooklyn, Astoria and beyond.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
We know these characters are going through a lot, even if we don't always see it. And so, this short, ramshackle, shrinking movie manages to stick with you.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
The film begins in fits and starts, and the ending is a bit trite, too, but it's a fairly satisfying look at how real people relate to each other, or fail to do so, in a relationship.
 "
"People, Places, Things",76,72,critic,"
...a sweeter, genuinely funny film that's more interested in the people telling the jokes than the jokes themselves.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,audience,"There is such an interesting and unique story behind this documentary, sadly the documentary itself doesn't do it justice. The documentary never take the time to truly establish what is happening, so much potential wasted. 


At times I even missed any type of Werner Herzog narration or something"
The Wolfpack,86,68,audience,"On the surface, The Wolfpack looks to be a tale of strangeness and queerness but beneath it all is actually a story of great sadness and fear that really spoke to me. The director does well not to exploit the family in any sense and allow us to gain an understanding of the boys fascination with movies and why they are how they are. The father is clearly and abusive egomaniac with a god complex and the boys didn't know any different until the elder ones matured and started thinking more for themselves. The saving grace of the story is the boys as a unit, there always there for each other and their mother who shows them love and affection that their father derives them of. It's a documentary about the magic of movies and how we can get lost in them but more importantly it's about the importance of family, free-will and the ability to be who you want to be and do what you want to do. Heart-wrenching and uplifting. "
The Wolfpack,86,68,audience,"Even without the problems of consent and invasiveness brought in, the film still seems like an exercise in having a great story fall into your lap and not knowing quite what to do with it."
The Wolfpack,86,68,audience,3.5/5.0 stars - Grade: B
The Wolfpack,86,68,audience,"Some disturbing scenes occur in this otherwise myopic and aimless doco that feels more like a student film than a documentary release. Story focuses on a group of movie-fixated kids who's 'home schooling' basically means being shut indoors until they are teenagers, stoked not so much by the threat of urban violence or youthful mischief as the pathologically controlling tendencies of their inadequate parents. The film never really explains, or explores why the parents are so (insanely) controlling, and the film becomes largely aimless sometime after the midway point. The characters are, I guess willingly, part of an exploration of an underprivileged family that feels more exploitative than anything else at times. The Wolfpack lacks story beats or craft; the film is a typically unflattering attempt at ""real"" film art from New York, but like most other ""real"" cultural products from the great city, it simply doesn't add up."
The Wolfpack,86,68,audience,"A troubling window into family cut off, isolated from the world. It's disturbing how alienated these kids are due to a father with such issues, but also touching how they found such solace in film. The fact that these kids were able to turn out as well adjusted as they are, thanks to film is something to behold. It's also comforting."
The Wolfpack,86,68,audience,Pretty standard documentary about a rather odd family. Maybe the strangest thing about them is that they're not even more messed up given the way they were brought up. Should be noted that they are pretty damn talented at making props for films etc and their acting is surprisingly good. They have talent for sure.
The Wolfpack,86,68,audience,"The Wolfpack is interesting and highly respectful, but lacks some cinematographic excellence. Still, important for many to see, but you need the right mindset for this documentary. It seems to properly start after 30min."
The Wolfpack,86,68,audience,Cinephiles everywhere will love this.
The Wolfpack,86,68,audience,"7 kids, one apartment, a lot of time on their hands, no experience with the outside world, all the movies they can watch. What you have is one peculiar documentary about perhaps the most interesting family I've ever seen in film. The film doesn't always give them the kind of star treatment they need, but director Crystal Moselle was just out of film school at the time, so let's not forget to grade this on a curve. Actually, the fact that she made this straight out of film school is a magnificent feat. The Wolfpack is fascinating, haunting, and hopeful. I felt for these 7 kids. I liked them, a lot. They are so sweet, and curious about the world, and they articulate it through the movies. You know, I relate to that so much. I for one, have lived through the movies as well, perhaps not as thoroughly as these guys, but when you have social anxiety as a child you tend to gravitate towards the make-believe. I loved these kids, I hated their father (even though he seemed to redeem himself at the end), and I wish them all the best of luck going forward. This documentary is GOOD."
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
In any event, The Wolfpack still intrigues, largely because of the Angulo boys' liveliness and tenacity.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
Sad and strange, funny and touching, wholly unusual and like nothing you've ever seen before, The Wolfpack is both powerful and unsettling.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
At no point The Wolfpack comes across as patronizing. For the most part, the filmmaker treats the kids as peers and, in turn, the Angulos reward Moselle with endearing openness.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
The Wolfpack is thought-provoking and sometimes touching, but there is a nagging sense that Moselle didn't dig deep enough into the abusive situation.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
The Wolfpack is half about the burden of having a terrible human being for a parent and half about the ability of art to save souls. It is powerful, gripping and not to be missed.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
The Wolfpack is an intriguing portrait of an accidental social experiment, but the narrative created to support it is too disjointed and skin-deep to really resonate.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
Director Crystal Moselle gained remarkable access, both to the Angulo boys and to their library of home movies, but The Wolfpack is largely about the triumph of a fascinating subject over a pedestrian treatment.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
Blurs the traditional border between documentary filmmaker and subject, as director Crystelle Moselle captures the quotidian details of family dysfunction with intimacy, but also discretion.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
The story is as intriguing as it is unbelievable, as a paranoid immigrant, his pliant wife and their seven children live in self-imposed confinement, in the middle of New York City.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
How weird and riveting and creepily fantastic a new documentary about an eccentric and lavishly haired family living in New York is.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
Equally disturbing, funny and heart-warming, there's no movie quite like The Wolfpack out there. It has to be seen to be believed.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
The Wolfpack works best when the subjects are being let out into the world to experience things for the first time, displaying how their massive knowledge of cinema has drilled unbelievable visions of the outside world into their heads
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
The result is a multi-layered narrative, slightly tricky and elusive in form, but with subjects who are refreshingly, touchingly frank.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
It's cute, funny, and sad.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
Like the boys, [The Wolfpack] is a powerful force to be reckoned with-and one that should be seen by all.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
Under the guise of cinéma vérité, Moselle has stitched together a dreamy reverie that, if not a put-on, fetishizes a dangerously dysfunctional situation. Clearly I'm in the minority... but this feels like the worst kind of ""noble savage"" filmmaking.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
The collaboration between the boys and the filmmaker delivers The Wolfpack with a palpable degree of honesty and compassion.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
What The Wolfpack makes very clear is the way the movies, and the imagination and empathy involved in watching and making movies, helped these boys survive their difficult, claustrophobic childhood, make some sense of their bizarre history.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
Moselle presents a narrative that deftly avoids judgment and analysis. Her own footage, which spans five years, is supplemented by extensive home videos recorded by the family, which lends the story both a discomfiting intimacy and a cool objectivity.
 "
The Wolfpack,86,68,critic,"
These questions are subsumed in The Wolfpack's stunning testament to the redemptive power of cinema.

"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,audience,Ok mediocre movie starring the very talented Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer. This is your ordinary get away with murder movie but has some fun aspects that makes this movie not boring. But after a day you'll forget all about it just like me. It makes for a pretty good movie night because one after the movie you'll find something better to talk about with your friends but who knows. Anyway in the end Robert Downey was great as always but the rest of the film makes for a good one time watch and forget the next day.
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,audience,Ok mediocre movie starring the very talented Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer. This is your ordinary get away with murder movie but has some fun aspects that makes this movie not boring. But after a day you’ll forget all about it just like me. It makes for a pretty good movie night because one after the movie you’ll find something better to talk about with your friends but who knows. Anyway in the end Robert Downey was great as always but the rest of the film makes for a good one time watch and forget the next day.
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,audience,"Iron Man is in this movie, but his eyeballs look huge and wrong, which is very distracting. He also talks to the audience the whole time like in Emperors New Groove, except this movie is for adults, so there's too much meta and so many fake deep thoughts about CSA. Watchable but not enjoyable. 1 star awarded for the Robocop cameo in the beginning of the movie."
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,audience,"""Kiss the Ground"" soars, uplifting audiences with the comforting notion that it isn't too late to restore our planet to a luscious, thriving home for humanity. Directors Joshua and Rebecca Tickell have masterfully pieced together some of Hollywood's finest, along with experts in agriculture, to demonstrate how regenerative living is both easily accessible and personally rewarding. With a heartening passion that can be felt through the screen, these activists and experts spotlight their personal efforts in regenerating the planet from the ground up. ""Kiss the Ground"" really shines in its ability to capture and maintain audience's interest, while offering innovative solutions and ideas I would have never confronted without having had the joy of watching this film."
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,audience,"A Christmas movie for no other reason than it's made by Shane Black, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a film that plays as fast and loose with reality and the 4th wall as Deadpool does, maybe even more so. Its tongue is firmly in its cheek, and it's the kind of material that Shane Black excels at. It's not as funny as The Nice Guys, but from the performances alone you can tell they were made by the same person. Every character is essentially a larger-than-life parody of themselves, but here the crux of the story is taken more seriously. It's a tale of infidelity, forced incarceration and cold-blooded murder, all juxtaposed against a serious of black comedy set pieces. The jokes often catch you off-guard, and that's honestly why most of them are so funny. People approach absurdity with a deadpan seriousness, and the sudden bursts of unexpected violence are usually what draw out the biggest laughs. The films does have its flaws, chief among which being its insistence on Robert Downey Jnr constantly indulging in long, seemingly ad-libbed awkward rambling routines, something I find insufferable regardless of who's doing it. Also, I found the story difficult to follow at times, largely due to the films many divergences and scenes which drag. For me, Val Kilmer is the man who steals the show, and just like Tombstone it proves that he can give the most incredible performances if he's given the appropriate material. It has its ups and downs, but it's a film I could easily recommend to someone who likes this kind of movie. If it sounds like your thing, try it on and see how it fits."
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,audience,"Very entertaining and witty with an intelligent set-up.  Kilmer and Downey have great chemistry and the dialogue can be pretty snappy.  The visual look of the film is very slick and stylish too.  The convoluted plot hindered my enjoyment a bit however, but since the movie's an homage to noir films, that's expected.  Overall I'm glad I watched it."
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,audience,"This is the movie that brought Robert Downey, Jr. back into the good graces of Hollywood, and paved the way for his full-on resurgence with Iron Man, and with good reason. He's plenty entertaining here as the thief-turned-actor, but all the best moments come as part of his interactions with Val Kilmer's deadpan gay detective. Together, they are ridiculously funny in this dark comedy, that plays more as a satire of the buddy-cop genre. The plot serves more as a vehicle for the jokes, but it still works. (3.5/5)"
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,audience,Feels dated and dull. Like a bunch of throw away lines from a Tarantino script in mashed together scenes.
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,audience,Incessant gay jokes and misogyny are the icing atop a dull plot. Even RDJ can't save a movie this bad.
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,audience,"Directed by Shane Black featuring longtime collaborator Robert Downey, Jr also starring Michelle Monaghan and Val Kilmer. 
Based on the book about a crook Harry Lockhart that flees from a robbery and accidentally comes into a Hollywood audition landing a job of acting. Harry even partners with a gay private detective for acting purposes. 
He also didn't expect to run into his childhood crush named Harmony who wanted to be an actress but her dream hasnt fully materialized. All of them get caught up in a big murder conspiracy that goes from one thing to the next. 
The movie zips by with great dialogue, clever writing, top notch actors, clever editing, not to mention the Christmas setting in Hollywood 
Even the opening credits reminds me of a James Bond movie. 
This whole thing serves as a parody of film noir tropes with Black poking fun at the industry and the people working in it while also trafficking stereotypes while conveying its beauty 
Anyone can remake themselves in the city of angels where the good bad and ugly dreams reside 
Shane Black's geniuseness of filmmaking shows here even if the plot is overly-convoluted 
Still a fun time though"

"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,critic,"
As though he were revisiting the 1970s' reimagining of the 1930s film noir, Black plays with the 21st-century spectator's expectations of perverse plot twists to highlight his characters' humanity.

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a quite brilliant, funny, and not altogether unnuanced, pastiche of fatalistic, old-school LA noir.

"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,critic,"
What's marvelous about director-screenwriter Shane Black's depiction of the holiday season is that he captures it in a way that feels true to life (no matter how absurd the circumstances).
 "
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,critic,"
The plot of the film is almost willfully convoluted. But it's also largely beside the point, an excuse for quite a few good scenes, most of them equal parts homage and subversion.

Kiss Kiss is such a delightful bombardment, we barely notice that Black's convoluted, serpentine plot doesn't make a lick of sense.

Part comedy, part romance and part crime caper, Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is one of the most entertaining and original films of the year.

"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,critic,"
This noir spoof is hammy pulp fiction to be sure, but the oddball characters and truly hilarious banter pull it right out of the B-grade bin and onto the cult shelf.
 "
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang",86,87,critic,"
Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is both an apology for soiling American cinema and surrender to the mass appeal that allowed it to happen. It's a bold experiment, yet only occasionally a great movie.

It's a cinematic giraffe, both awkward and overreaching.

Ratatouille,96,87,critic,"
Despite the unexplained language barriers or farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious foray into the unimaginable never becomes preachy or immature.
 "
Ratatouille,96,87,critic,"
This is a film about a rat who becomes a chef in Paris. But it's so much more than that. It's about what a great artist can be, where a great artist can come from, it's about food and how to savour it.

The studio's latest effort offers beautiful and strikingly realistic animation, but the flawed concept should have been scrapped...

Ratatouille was written and directed by Brad Bird, the guy behind The Incredibles, and while his new movie isn't as brainy as that one, it has lots of lovely touches to appeal to parents as well as kids.

Morning Glory,55,51,audience,"It was 2010, then came the social media and a lot changed"
Morning Glory,55,51,audience,"I wonder why appealing actors did this movie, having read the silly, sentimental script. Oh, money. It was bright and cheerful but, well, cynical, silly, and indulgent of every possible cliche in this genre. The soundtrack music was loud, intrusive, annoying."
Morning Glory,55,51,audience,"Commedia ironica e leggera; solo a tratti la banalità diventa eccessiva.
Rachel McAdams diverte e si diverte con questi personaggi frizzanti e nevrotici.
Il ritmo elevato permette di non stare troppo a pensare alla sceneggiatura e ai difetti, trascinando lo spettatore dentro la storia."
Morning Glory,55,51,audience,"This is a good, original, well acted  movie with great characters. Both Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford have really strong performances, and the Ford effort is so different than what most of us know him for that it is enough to watch the movie all by itself. I honestly cannot understand low ratings for this movie even if you don't love the genre."
Morning Glory,55,51,audience,"In terms of a plot, there's not much to bite into here. McAdams and Ford are charming enough to make it relatively enjoyable though."
Morning Glory,55,51,audience,Rachel McAdams makes this movie worthwhile.

Morning Glory,55,51,audience,"Fun storyline, delightful Rachel McAdams and just great to see Harrison Ford & Diane Keaton together. All in all fine little movie."
Morning Glory,55,51,audience,"The critics mostly didn't like this movie, but I loved it.  Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford are great, there were plenty of laughs, and some good, heartfelt moments as well."
Morning Glory,55,51,audience,An underrated comedy with a down to Earth story that has great characters and real life situations.

Complacency is the guiding principle of Morning Glory.

Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
What it does it does well.
 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
This talented cast is stuck in a low-rent script that is just as dimwitted as the daytime talk show at the center of the film.
 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
The producers and writers missed a chance either to make the case for television news or to bid it a fond farewell. To ignore such an obvious elephant in the room seemed odd.

I saw Broadcast News twenty-three years ago and I remember every word. I saw Morning Glory last week, but I don't think it'll have the same impact. Fun, but ultimately forgettable.

Morning Glory can't find its footing between romantic comedy... and biting workplace comedy.
 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
Morning Glory is a lackluster knockoff to Devil Wears Prada, minus the heart, cleverness and fashion. It's just not a good time, as it claims to be.
 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
The perky heroine played by Rachel McAdams.... is so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed she probably showers with caffeinated soap.
 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
Director Roger Mitchell and the great cast bring so much energy and humour to Morning Glory that it becomes an enjoyable, if completely unaffecting, piece of escapist fluff - just like good breakfast television.
 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
A cut above the usual rom-com tripe while remaining several notches below the caliber of talent involved.

It's hard not to have fun at this delightful comedy which features strong performances from McAdams, Ford and Keaton.
 "

"

Watching McAdams juggle all the pieces provides much of the laughs, but both Keaton and Ford get some positively hilarious traction as Colleen and Mike clash on the air and compete for the spotlight.
 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
Behind the frivolity of this rom-com also lurks a serious theme about the importance of proper old-school journalism.

It's entirely appropriate that Morning Glory ultimately turns into a celebration of quaffable, formulaic fluff.

 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
You don't watch stuff like Morning Glory for intelligent commentary on modern life and everyone involved is aware of it ... while there's been good, sometimes funny drama about the collision of news and entertainment never has it been so pointless.
 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
Ford is a snarling cartoon version of his grim political thriller self played for laughs. And McAdams is no Mary Tyler Moore but she's just this side of being that appealing.
 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
At worst, it may put you to sleep.
 "
Morning Glory,55,51,critic,"
Sit-com style zany comedy that won't exactly change your life, but has the odd good joke and proves Rachel McAdams well capable of carrying a film, even opposite Harrison Ford and Diana Keaton.

Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,audience,Not the best in the series. The story kinda lost my attention compared to the other movies in this series
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,audience,"I enjoyed this part more than the third one. Casting and acting was good. Plot was was little better. Horror and jump elements were nill. There is one problem with this franchise; the things keep repeating again and again. Due to this, so many sequels look unnecessary. Yes, you may enjoy all the parts but at one time you will think ""why stretching a franchise so much."""
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,audience,"An unnecessary and uninteresting addition to the franchise with underwhelming action sequences, a convoluted and uneven plot, and flat performances."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,audience,Slower than previous entries but the CGI is far more impressive.
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,audience,"Hey, it's a movie.  Enjoy it!"
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,audience,"By far my favorite Resident Evil movie. It's action packed, features the best final boss fight of the franchise in Albert Wesker, it course corrected Alice's power levels from the previous movie, and Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield was a welcomed addition to cast."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,audience,"It's the worst of the franchise, it's far from good but not close to garbage (for me) i consider it watchable, the CGI is horrible, the performances far from good, at least i didn't hate it so much as some pepole, but it doesn't mean i loved it."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,audience,The return of some of the game characters helped a lot as did the nods to those same games. Big dumb action but it works.

 "
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,critic,"
Resident Evil: Afterlife recycles nearly every horror convention. The plot is not original and the 3D is quite bad. And since we've literally seen all this before, it's only occasionally entertaining, and rarely interesting.
 "
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,critic,"
Resident Evil: Afterlife sees Anderson returning to cinematic dreck with a stunningly tedious exercise in 3-D CGI wankery.
 "

 "
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,critic,"
With a simple plot paired with great action scenes in its brisk run time, that's all I really need from the series and 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' puts some new blood and excitement into what was close to becoming a dead franchise.
 "
Resident Evil: Afterlife,22,48,critic,"
The action, however spirited in its manic creativity, is so relentlessly repetitive that it ceases to be as cool as the director plainly imagines it to be a very long time before the end of the movie .

The Other Guys,78,60,audience,"The plot was a little confusing, but the actors I thought were pretty good in it. I absolutely loved the humor- it had me cracking up during most of it with the subtle and not so subtle jokes. Some of it was a little crude or I didn't understand, but overall it was pretty enjoyable throughout."
The Other Guys,78,60,audience,Twisted humour to love.
The Other Guys,78,60,audience,One of the funniest movies I have seen
The Other Guys,78,60,audience,How can so much talent generate so few laughs? Miss this one.
The Other Guys,78,60,audience,This movie is hilarious. Will Ferrell and mark whalberg had great chemistry and they played off each other really well. I enjoyed it a lot. I still talk about certain scenes to this day!
The Other Guys,78,60,audience,Fun watch forgettable movie though
The Other Guys,78,60,audience,"Cops Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are a pair of sub-standard detectives in the NYPD who are trying to work their way up to competent.  Ferrell and Wahlberg have a natural chemistry and generate some big laughs, especially in the first half of the film.  Since much of the comedy is created through dialogue, the movie loses a bit of comedic steam in the second half due to a seemingly overly complicated plot and lengthy action scenes.  Regardless, the interactions between the two cops from disparate backgrounds is worth the price of admission and the ""desk pop"" scene is a classic."
The Other Guys,78,60,audience,"The Other Guys

All I expected from The Other Guys was that it makes me laugh, and it did, for two hours straight.
 "
The Other Guys,78,60,critic,"
""The Other Guys"" gets completely sidetracked with its seemingly tacked-on high concept about busting white-collar crimes perpetrated by sinister multinational conglomerates.
 "
The Other Guys,78,60,critic,"
The Other Guys is the rare big-budget studio comedy that knows how to allocate its resources.
 "
The Other Guys,78,60,critic,"
Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell have excellent chemistry, and provide for a lot of funny moments, but a poorly written plot and some forced jokes make The Other Guys only a good, not great comedy.
 "

One of the biggest problems overall, besides the lack of comedy, was the lack of story.

"
The Other Guys,78,60,critic,"

The first 30 minutes of the film, where this concept is really milked to the max, easily makes for some of the funniest comedy of the year.
 "
The Other Guys,78,60,critic,"
The Other Guys is the sort of movie that generates some of its best jokes quietly in the background or as quick-hit throwaway lines, while other terrific gags are defiantly over the top.
 "
The Other Guys,78,60,critic,"
Not all of the gags pan out, but when they do they get more than a few chuckles.
 "
The Other Guys,78,60,critic,"
Juxtaposes the excesses of our unregulated financial sector with the excesses of the buddy cop movie.
 "
The Other Guys,78,60,critic,"
This is the fourth feature that Will Ferrell and writer-director Adam McKay have collaborated on, and once again they deliver laugh-out-loud if ultimately disposable comedy with mixed messages about arrested male development.
 "
The Other Guys,78,60,critic,"
There are quite a few fun and hilarious moments to be had thanks to a knockout supporting cast, but there's a reason we've never followed ""the other guys"" before.

Coraline,90,73,audience,This movie is soo good. The plot is amazing. Make a coraline 2
Coraline,90,73,audience,"I came in expecting an alice in wonderland meets nightmare before Christmas kind of thing. Boy howdy did it give me more than I was expecting! With stunning visuals, a strong and likable but still a little selfish main lead, and a downright creepy vibe that I cant help but absolutely enjoy."
Coraline,90,73,audience,"Coraline was the film that can push me in the dark place of children's memories. The stop-motion technique is very interesting for me, Coraline film is very smooth and has many fantasy scenes that I don't think are stop-motion. Laika studio can do the perfect stop-motion apart from humans they also do very good animal movement. Coraline has a very interesting plot story that can attract people including the name of film and main character ""Coraline"" not Caroline. In the movie people will call her name wrong and I think that part made viewers recognize her name easier. About storytelling, it is very interesting about family problems, children, including cheating. We can clearly see Coraline does not really like her parents that much. She is the little girl that needs attention and friends but her parents take her to an old house that looks goosebumps and  strange neighbors. I love the way that creators created mood and tone on character design and scenes, fade and dark tone can represent environment and the story in a good way also yellow raincoat of Coraline make her pop up but still match with her blue hair and the scene. I can't tell like my friends who said this film is a little scary and looks like a nightmare because I have liked this film since I was young. I don't know why I'm not scared like other children but I believe I'm not the only one who likes this kind of movie. Soundtrack in the movie is also pretty cool too, I love the way that I felt fall in the deep mood with the story and music. Coraline was created by Henry Selick, who made ‘The Nightmare Before Christmas' and I love both films that are created by stop-motion and 3-D in a gloomier image but looks fantastic. I think Coraline is a very good movie that has an interesting story and good process about artwork in there."
Coraline,90,73,audience,The lesson learned: don't abandon your birth mommy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Coraline,90,73,audience,"This movie is my favourite of all time, the details and soundtrack everything matches the mysterious vibe. This is a masterpiece."
Coraline,90,73,audience,Loved it as a kid still love it as an adult. Still gives me nightmares and it's worth it
Coraline,90,73,audience,"A triumph of animation with the elements of a Grimm fairytale and a ghost story wrapped into one. Real parents be warned, Coraline is honestly too dark for a PG rating. I first saw it when I was about 12 and had nightmares for weeks.  That said, I did come back for more and give it this 5 star rating. Coraline is more nuanced, better visually planned, and more physiologically rooted than any supernatural adult horror piece I've seen. Fraud's ‘consuming mother' archetype is explored in a bizarre context as the film draws horror and suspense from a narrative centered around control and confinement (both literal and emotional). The other world is a delicious inversion of reality's honest monotony; it's more uncanny and rotten than Alice's Wonderland ever was and more fun too. 
Coraline is also refreshing in that it breaks regular child/young adult adventure narrative structures. It's nice to find a movie that understands how boring and restricting the limited freedom of youth can be rather than striving to capture ""the magic of childhood"". The other world and its dangers neither represent adulthood nor serve to mature and develop Coraline into a fully realized heroin. She is already brave, clever, and confident from the start. Her adventure changes how she contextualizes her world and relates to others rather than developing new traits she was lacking. She learns the classic lesson ‘be careful what you wish for' in terms of wishing to change other people. Customizing neighbors, friends, and even family is a moral door best left closed."
Coraline,90,73,audience,"This is awesome! Here are a list of things I liked about it:
1. Not a minute is wasted. Everything that happened contributed to the bigger plot, or the ideas of the story.
2. Awesome characters. Realistic and great development.
3. The story keeps moving. And moving. And it doesn't stop until it finishes.

I strongly recommend you to see Coraline because it's awesome."
Coraline,90,73,audience,Coraline is an eye-catching and entertaining journey of fantasy from beggining to end.
Coraline,90,73,audience,"Nice, quality animation, primarily for kids, but adults can enjoy too. 
And the moral story of it is for everyone; your wonderful dreams could be very deceptive.
And you may only notice this once you start living in them. 
Therefore you should appreciate your reality with  all of its mishaps, and odds.

The plot is that Coraline is  a kid and she dreams about the things behind little unused door in the new house they moved.
House is in apartman in an old mansion.
Coraline is not happy with the house, and he parents lack of attention on her makes her unhappy.
Both mother and father are  too busy with their own work.

In her dreams behind that strange little  door there is copy of her mother, and father and everything is in the form she wants.
But soon she will find out that it is a witchy deception. 
Then she will start fighting against it. And when she wakes up she is thankful that it was a dream.
It goes on like this for a while.
But one day when she wakes up, she notices that she wakes up into the same dream.
And she has to put up a real fight to get back to her real life."

Coraline is an interesting film that leaves its audience with two thoughts. Normal life is perfect, even when it isn't, and beware of dreams with fangs.

All involved in this production deserve praise for turning Coraline into a triumph of storytelling and cinematic technology. Whether you're young, middle-age or older, you'll adore it.
 "
Coraline,90,73,critic,"
For all its shortcomings, Coraline nevertheless has more imagination, heart and inventiveness in it than most recent animated films.
 "
Coraline,90,73,critic,"
You know from the very first sequence that Coraline is an extraordinary movie that is going to rattle the bejeezus out of young audience members and -- the truth be told -- their fathers as well.
 "
Coraline,90,73,critic,"
It would be difficult for any filmmaker to mimic Gaiman's seductively amusing and imaginative writing, and Selick, who also wrote the script, should be commended for not falling back on some golden-tongued narrator. But his Coraline could use more spunk.
 "
Coraline,90,73,critic,"
The movie, though, dares not go below the surface. Could the problem be its use of 3-D? Did the filmmakers think that to offset this additional, illusory visual dimension they had to remove all depth from the story itself?
 "
Coraline,90,73,critic,"
It's the stop-motion figures themselves who steal the show. They're so vivid and expressive, in both body and facial movements, that they cease being mere puppets and take on a life all their own.
 "
Coraline,90,73,critic,"
The fine details and surreal flourishes Selick lavishes upon Coraline's tentative travels into the unknown are a never-ending delight. Even during the sections of the story that are intended to disturb.

There's a general overbearing unpleasantness to Observe and Report, and you get the feeling this was the intention -- in order to make it more ""like life.""

The film becomes almost nauseating, though, after serving up a steady diet of violence, drug use, racism and date rape.
 "

This movie has a clever idea - what if a mall cop truly believed he was society's last protector? - and then wraps it up in stylish sight gags and muffles the message by making Ronnie just a garden-variety, everyday bipolar depressive.

The Secret Life of Bees,59,78,audience,"*SPOILERS*

The Secret Life of Bees is a historical fiction work. The book is written by Sue Monk Kidd and the Movie is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. This is a coming of age story about a girl who learns about her past and what her future could become. 

The theme seems to be about the irrationality of racism, mostly about how Lily overcomes her own racism. It also has undertones of how prejudice is sometimes learned from a young age and can be hard to overcome.

There were many parts of the movie that were different from the book, which created some plot holes. The reason Zach went to jail was different, Lily's last question to T. Ray was different, and they never rubbed honey on the Black Madonna. Other than the inaccuracies and the pacing, the movie was okay. 

I enjoyed the movie, but the purple honey scene is just as awkward and uncomfortable in the movie as it is in the book, if not more so. If you haven't read the book, it's a pretty good movie. If you have read the book, try not to cringe too hard."
The Secret Life of Bees,59,78,audience,"I read the book The Secret Life of Bees written by Sue Monk Kidd, and watched the movie directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. They are both a historical fiction story about a girl named Lily, who killed her mother when she was little, who runs away and finds new friends and you follow along on her journey. I think the author's purpose is to show the strength of women, the weakness, the ability in all of us to grow and change, and become independent. The main theme I got from the book and the movie was that forgiveness is important in growing and maturing. I personally think the movie was a pretty good representation of the novel. There were some minor differences in the characters that I noticed, like Lily having a different hair color, but the only big difference between the novel and the movie was that I think that the novel evaluated the meaning of the ""bees"" better and more in depth. Overall, I think that the movie works well with the novel, and that if you read the book you should watch the movie too. The novel was better than the movie in my opinion because it went more into detail and depth about the theme. They are both really good and have a good theme and I recommend both."
The Secret Life of Bees,59,78,audience,"(contains spoilers!) The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd novel was great. It had amazing pacing, lovely characters, and relatable issues throughout. The movie though, by Gian Prince-Bythewood, not so great. From someone who read the Novel first there are alot of important plot points and character developments missing. Sue Monk Kidd wanted to portray her book as an inside look into many struggles of POC, Women, and mental health issues. All while telling the story of a girl named Lily and her early tragic life. This book has many themes ranging from the Irrationality of Racism to Female power. The themes in the novel are in depth and well sewed into the story line. The movie is rushed so it leaves little to no time for important themes to shine through. !!Spoiler!! In the book May's death is slow and hard hitting, it describes each character's feelings perfectly through either action or dialogue. The movie basically skips through it, causing it to go from an emotional moment to just another character death. (I was personally very mad they didn't add a Neil/June wedding scene). This movie isn't the worst, the actors picked represent the novel characters well, and there are some good heartfelt scenes. In the end it's just another movie that does the book dirty. Watch it if you desire, but I recommend you read the book first."
The Secret Life of Bees,59,78,audience,"This movie is  based on the historical fiction novel, The Secret Life of Bees, written by Sue Monk Kidd. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, The Secret Life of Bees brings you the story of 14 year-old, Lily Owens who runs away from her abusive father with her caregiver, Rosaleen, in search of the truth about her mother. Through this journey she meets the Boatwright sisters who take her and Rosaleen in and help Lily to find that answers she needs. Throughout the story we see Lily grow into a mature, young lady. Kidd shows us what a motherly figure truly is and shows us how powerful women can be. I think that the movie in comparison to the novel follows the storyline pretty well. I believe that for the most part the novel is an accurate representation of the theme, characters, and events that happen throughout the novel. There are some parts in which the director changed what the characters said or did. One example of this would be the significance of bees. Throughout the novel bees are a major part of the story and I feel that in the movie they did not portray the bees as well as I would of liked. The movie never tells us as to why they covered the hives with black cloths when one of the characters dies and in the novel we learn this is so the bees can morn too. Overall, I think was a good movie and would recommend it to a friend. It is entertaining and teaches us what motherly love is. I would rate this a 3.5 out of 5. I recommend this movie to family and all people."
The Secret Life of Bees,59,78,audience,"!!!! CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!!    The Secret Life of Bees,a fictional book, by Sue Monk Kidd, and  directed by Gina Prince- Bythewood. It is about a girl who has run away from home with a substitute  mother and escaped to a small town of Tiburon. She stays with these three sisters and starts to work for them and builds a connection with them. The author's purpose for writing this book is to show the struggles of POC women along with depression. All why telling the story of the girl who ran away showing that not everybody's life is perfect. There are multiple themes to this story but the one that truly sticks out to me is female empowerment. Watching the movie after reading the book you can tell that there are some things missing and with this, the theme is not as empowering about female power. There are some scenes in the movie that represent female empowerment but not as much as the book showed and explained. At the very end of the book all the daughters of Mary show up to defend Lily but in the movie they did not and it felt more empowering in the book. I think that Sue Monk Kidd wrote a great book especially empowering women, and I think that Gina Prince- Bythewood did an okay job working with what she had and trying to use most of the scenes from the movie. If you want to watch the movie I would recommend reading the book first because the movie misses some of the best parts."
The Secret Life of Bees,59,78,audience,"In the historical fiction book and novel, The Secret Life of Bees, the author, Sue Monk Kidd, and the director, Gina Prince-Bythewood portrayed the story of a girl, Lily, on how she is searching for a place where there is a motherly figure there to love her. Throughout her journey, there is up and downs that she faces that the audience gets to witness too. There are many other themes in this novel, but one that stood out to me was the empowerment of women. I feel that Kidd wanted this theme to stand out the most in this novel. Throughout the novel and book, the storyline that was portrayed in both was very similar to one another, the actors that played certain characters fit their description as in the book, and the main events were similar as well. One difference that stood out to me was how there was a big significance of the bees in the novel that wasn't really shown in the movie. Overall, the book was better in my opinion, but the movie was good too. To recap, the author and director's work was projected well because the book and novel relate to each other pretty similarly. I would recommend someone to read the novel before watching the movie because there is more of a significance in the book that you don't get to see in the movie."
The Secret Life of Bees,59,78,audience,"The Secret Life of Bees is a historical fiction book by Sue Monk Kidd, and a movie directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. A motherless girl named Lily learns from three african american sisters that teach her life lessons, help her learn about her mother, and teach her about the Black Madonna. Sue Monk Kidd wrote this book to highlight racism in the 60s and show how important motherly figures are. I don't think the movie was that good. The book was so in depth that trying to fit everything into a movie made it all feel rushed and confusing. For example, in the book May finds out about Zach being in jail about a week later than he gets in. I'm pretty sure there's at least one chapter difference between these events so you can really feel the anticipation of the secret getting out. There's about 3 minutes between Zach getting in jail and May finding out in the movie. Sue Monk Kidd's book was amazing, but this movie doesn't stack up. If you haven't read the book, I think it's a great movie for you. If you have read the book, don't let this ruin it for you. The pacing is too fast, and the events were even a little confusing for me even though I knew what was going to happen."
The Secret Life of Bees,59,78,audience,"!!Spoilers!!
Secret Life of Bees, a science fiction novel by Sue Monk Kidd, movie directed by Gina Prince Bythewood. This movie and novel outlines the life of a young white girl, in the Civil Rights Era,  who escapes her abusive father to uncover the truth about her mother and her past. She escaped to Tiburon, South Carolina where she met the Boatwright sisters and began her adventure through the twists and turns of her mother's past. The movie in my opinion was an okay representation of the book. The parts that were cut off did not make much sense to me at all. I feel that some of the most significant parts were left out. The theme was represented very well in the movie especially in Lily. All of the characters are somewhat close to how I imagined them but August didn't look how I expected her to. Many events were left out in the movie such as June and Neil's wedding and Lily's phone call to T. Ray. I found those parts very significant and they were not presented in the movie. I believe the director did a good job representing the theme and what the book was really about but failed to present many parts that accompanied the theme."
The Secret Life of Bees,59,78,audience,"<<<SPOILERS>>>
The Secret Life of Bees book is written by Sue Monk Kidd and the movie is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood; they are both historical fiction. Both take place in the 60s that show the life of a young girl named Lily. The purpose of this novel and movie is to showcase the life of Lily.
<<<SPOILERS HERE>>>
The movie and the book were very different although the themes were the same. The characters could have been portrayed differently along with some of the events. In the book Lily's father finds her because she makes a call to him that he tracks to where she is and in the movie he finds her based off of a map in her room. In the book Lily and her mother have black hair and in the movie they are both blond. Although Sue Monk Kidd and  Gina Prince-Bythewood have two different versions of The Secret Life of Bees both are very good and thought out. I would recommend this movie but not until after you read the book due to the fact the movie leaves out some things."
The Secret Life of Bees,59,78,audience,"The author of the historical fiction novel, The Secret Life of Bees, is Sue Monk Kidd; and the movie of the same name is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. The movie follows a young girl, Lily Owens, as she tries to find who her mother really is. The Secret Life of Bees has many different themes, from forgiveness to the importance of religion. I think the movie was pretty good, though it had some inconsistencies. The movie leaves some characters out and skips some scenes, but manages to work around these obstacles. It is understandable why they would not follow the same script as the movie, as the movie would drag on and on and be very boring at times. Overall, I think the movie was good and is worth a watch if you have read the novel."

Step Brothers,55,69,audience,"It's like a typical Will Ferrel movie. Very funny, but a lil dumb."
Step Brothers,55,69,audience,this defines late 00s comedy films
Step Brothers,55,69,audience,"Why critics rated this movie so low just makes no sense to me. It's literally the greatest comedy I've ever watched, and it only gets better with repeat viewings. You would be doing yourself an inservice by not watching this at least once."
Step Brothers,55,69,audience,Hilarious film amazing job by Will Ferrell and John C.Reilly 
Step Brothers,55,69,audience,you will laugh constantly through this film one of the best comedy movies ever!!! cannot rate it highly enough!!! the Will Ferrell and John C Reilly combination is epic
Step Brothers,55,69,audience,You should know what you're getting into when watching this movie. John C Reilly and Will Ferrell have great chemistry. The whole cast is brilliant and they all brought a lot of laughs. Adam McKay done a great job. I love that in his movies he incorporates  great songs and he does that once again with this movie.
Step Brothers,55,69,audience,It's just not very funny.
Step Brothers,55,69,audience,I can always count on this movie for many good laughs
Step Brothers,55,69,audience,"When two middle-aged losers who still live at home meet for the first time tensions are high as the two 40 year olds appear to hate each other and a ‘power struggle' ensues. When Brennan's mom and Dale's dad decide to marry, the two are forced to share rooms. The destructive disarray is found to be too much to handle for the happily newlyweds so the two are given an ultimatum, 30 days to find a job or you're out on your ass. Out on the job search path Brennen and Dale come to the realization they have a immense amount in common, they decide they MUST be best friends but that only compounds the domestic disarray."
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
One of those films that is impossible to rate highly, but impossible to not recommend.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
Step Brothers obviously isn't the most complex screenplay ever written, but Ferrell, McKay and Reilly (who all co-wrote the film) manage to milk plenty of comedy out of essentially a one-joke movie.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
We've been down this path before with Ferrell, and at this point it feels like we're just walking in circles.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
The film doesn't aspire to much. It's happy to milk laughs from creative swearing, goofy, childish behavior, and a hilarious digression that explains exactly why you should never wake a sleepwalker. It does all of this well.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
It isn't even the funniest movie I've seen this year. But it sure made me laugh.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
It's a tad problematic, a mite disturbing and immensely funny.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
That ranks as a major disappointment, considering the two goofballs portraying the title Step Brothers -- Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly -- are usually good for at least a few laughs.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
While it's somewhat sweeter, if you will, than a typical Apatow flick, the ludicrous situations call for equally ludicrous behavior and statements.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
Step Brothers, in sum, adheres to the grand tradition of Apatow-Animal House-American Pie tastelessness. I tried not to laugh -- but gave in to the guilty juvenile pleasures.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
With their curly perms, slogan T-shirts (Life's a Beach, Spring Break '84 etc), nudie mags and Chewbacca masks, the stepbrothers make a nice comic pairing.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
[The script] feels more like a series of dares than the blueprint for a movie. But damn if it doesn't work from beginning to end, thanks to the stars' near-psychotic commitment to their characters
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
The potentially gooey conclusion is leavened with cynical irreverence.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
Though not as cleverly conceived or fully formed as Talladega Nights or Anchorman, this movie works because Ferrell and Reilly are completely believable as 13-year-olds stuck in 40-year-old bodies.
 "
Step Brothers,55,69,critic,"
They're just a freak show, an excuse to give us such 'gags' as Reilly emitting the longest and noisiest fart in screen history, and Ferrell exposing his scrotum and wiping it over Reilly's drum kit.

This is a 15-minute sketch - based on crude humour -- stretched out to the length of a feature film. For Ferrell fans only.

Oh, Brothers, this is one of the worst movies of 2008.

You only needed one look at the poster for Step Brothers to know exactly what this film would be like.

Step Brothers is unashamedly dumb, unoriginal and downright offensively childish. But aren't these the very same reasons why people like these movies?

The shouty variety of manchild comedy that Ferrell has cribbed from Jerry Lewis divides movie fans intensely. Here's the one we should put in the time capsule.

WALL-E,95,90,audience,"Only Pixar can make you fall in love with robots and root for them throughout the movie. This movie signifies the heights that Pixar can go to with the right ideas and dreams. I have always loved this movie and I think it still holds up to this day. There are no humans within the first 30-40 minutes but I think that not only sets the tone of the movie but it helps develop our main characters a lot more, without the use of a lot of dialogue. By the end, you have invested in these robots' stories and the outcome. It's truly a masterpiece."

WALL-E,95,90,audience,I'd give it about a 94%. Top tier Pixar movie. Starts a little slow and weird but has an amazing build up and conclusion. The movement of the robots is fascinating and the characters are funny. Great watch
WALL-E,95,90,audience,"Wall-E is definitely an animated classic, there is so much to be said (and already said) on how Pixar managed to create such an enjoyable and romantic trip between two robots, and their journey to bring humans back to earth. Even rewatching this in 2021, the animation in Wall-E holds up exceptionally well, especially so when compared to other early Pixar animations like The Incredibles. The film's pro-environment message and warning on global pollution still hits home today too. While I honestly can't find any fault within the movie's own original story, Wall-E borrows a lot from existing movies like 2001: Space Odyssey, and the number of overt and blatant 'references' ripped straight from other movies really took me out of the experience at times, and definitely takes away from the movie's seriousness and originality."
WALL-E,95,90,audience,"There is simply nothing negative for me to say about this film, the animation is stunning, the characters are unforgettable and the story is easily one of Pixar's most inventive."
WALL-E,95,90,audience,Beautiful animation a fun story and an adorable protagonist make this movie a childhood favorite for me.

Although the title character's arc is juxtaposed by the troubling dystopia on the Axiom, it nonetheless brings light to both Pixar's gloriously unique protagonists and real-world issues.
 "
WALL-E,95,90,critic,"
Although Wall-E ends with a very apt and moving nod to City Lights, it is in fact Pixar's answer to Modern Times-both a bravura summation of everything the studio is great at and a ""You ain't seen nothing yet!"" statement of purpose.
 "
WALL-E,95,90,critic,"
If Wall-E has anything original to say, it takes place in the first 30 minutes on a planet heaped high with junk. But the parallels between fiction and reality are almost too painful to contemplate.

In Bruges,84,87,audience,"""It's a fairytale fucking town. How can a fairytale town not be somebody's fucking thing? How can all those canals and bridges and cobbled streets and those churches and all that beautiful fucking fairytale stuff, how can that not be somebody's fucking thing, eh?""
- Ralph Fiennes as Harry.

Ralph Fiennes is such a hilarious menace in this movie. Nearly every line he speaks is quotable. And the performances by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are fabulous -- vulnerable, bad-ass, and funny.

In Bruges is just fantastic. I am probably biased in a way because I've been to Bruges which makes the scenes in the courtyard bars, the tower and the canal really come to life.

Witty dialogue intertwined with brutal violence has become a hallmark of Martin McDonagh's films, and this debut was one of his best.

P.S. This is going on my movies that make you want to drink/party list. Every time someone takes a sip of a Belgian beer, FROM THE LOCAL TAP, needs to drink."
In Bruges,84,87,audience,"This is my favourite movie of all time, without question. In Bruges is filled with unending wit and dark humour which never ceases to entertain, even on my 10th  viewing. The contrast in Ray and Ken's personalities adds so much colour to their relationship. I watched this film at a very dark point in my life, and I immediately related to Ray's oppresive lack of purpose. This meant that the ultimate message of the film, of redemption and finding a reason to carry on, was felt all the more. Also, it would be irresponsible of me not to mention the soundtrack, Carter Burswell's piano laden tracks add so much rich character to the beautiful setting, I stil listen to the soundtrack, years after my first viewing."
In Bruges,84,87,audience,"Fantastic screenwriting, acting---see this movie!"
In Bruges,84,87,audience,"Farrell e Gleeson danno vita ad una serie di scambi intensi di battute; taglienti e a tratti esilaranti.
La fotografia rende giustizia ad una città bellissima, raramente di ruolo centrale in un film fino a questo punto.
La sceneggiatura non è da meno, una serie di personaggi che mischiano le loro storie e personalità per un finale quasi spiazzante."
In Bruges,84,87,audience,Outrageously funny and surprisingly heartfelt. The cast all do brilliantly and this ticks every imaginable box without ever seeming to paper over the cracks.
In Bruges,84,87,audience,Might be to of a slow build for some but stick in there. Sticks the ending! Replay value: High
In Bruges,84,87,audience,One of the best modern comedies from a superb writing and directing talent.
In Bruges,84,87,audience,"0.79 laughs/min. 

I went to Bruges because of this movie. It's like a fucking fairytale or something. Beautiful performances from all."
In Bruges,84,87,audience,"Fantastic film. Incredible script that is both funny and explores complex themes throughout, this dialogue would fit perfectly in the theatre. Great performances, particularly from Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson in particular, and the beauty of Bruges is really brought to life"
In Bruges,84,87,audience,"Career best performances from Farrell and Gleeson, combined with McDonagh's wittiest screenplay, turn what could have been an average crime film with a strong premise, into a well rounded black comedy thriller which will leave viewers desperately perusing Sky Scanner for a weekend break to Bruges."
In Bruges,84,87,critic,"
Why make such a film at this point in time? There's a good deal going on in the world, why this? Does anyone care about a pair of dreamed-up assassins?
 "

In Bruges is a wildly imperfect feature debut, but it does make you curious to see what else McDonagh has to offer.

The Dark Knight,94,94,audience,"A masterpiece in every way, ranging from the sheer unpredictability ad excitement of the plot to the mesmerizing performance of the late Heath Ledger. I could not sing enough praise for this film."
The Dark Knight,94,94,audience,This movie is just iconic and a legend.
The Dark Knight,94,94,audience,The funniest Batman movie since the 1989 movie release!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Dark Knight,94,94,audience,The best superhero movie ever! The best movie villain and Heath Ledger is the best Joker! Great storytelling and awesome soundtrack from Hans Zimmer. Highly recommended movie to watch.
The Dark Knight,94,94,audience,"The greatest superhero film ever made. The Dark Knight is complex, entertaining and dark. It changed how we think about comic book films and influenced the entire genre.

Christian Bale is a perfect Bruce Wayne/Batman but Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker will always be what this film is remembered for.

Easily the best Batman film."
The Dark Knight,94,94,audience,"The Dark Knight: the best comic book-to-film adaptation ever created and assembled to watch in cinematic form. The villian is essentially a ""perfectly realised villian"". Heath Ledger embodied chaos like nothing that had ever been seen and brought to life in such away before. He would win a posthumous oscar for his breath-taking performance of the decade. The Dark Knight decimated boundaries and transcended the comic book genre like nothing before it ever concieved of. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathon Nolan both co-wrote The Dark Knight together and Chris Nolan directed the masterpiece."
The Dark Knight,94,94,audience,This is the best movie ever created. Everything from the writing to the special effects is spot on. But you can't talk about this movie without mentioning Heath ledger. He plays such a creepy and scary performance and it gives me chills every time he is on screen. Go watch this if you haven't already!
The Dark Knight,94,94,audience,"A work of art, the best superhero movie ever made. Excellent Performance (5 Stars)."
The Dark Knight,94,94,audience,Heath Ledger was amazing as The Joker. Best of the Christopher Nowlin Batman movies.
The Dark Knight,94,94,audience,"The Dark Knight is an absolute masterpiece. The movie has a compelling plot, great character development, and continues the story and lives up to the standard set in Batman Begins. Heath Ledger as the Joker stands out like no other, in a masterful performance that will stand the test of time. This movie is a MUST watch for both comic book fans, and general audiences alike."

The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,66,73,audience,"On par with the first outing for the Pevensie children, this sets the bar for more developed children who'd have an understanding of why this became a bit more in a way, scary?

Featuring even more cast members who excel and deliver what the character is and what they are.. phenomenal acting, truly magnificent. There are some who suggest this sequel doesn't top the original but I for one disagree as I see this the best of the three in the franchise. Having been away from Narnia for quite some time, they miss the adventure and overall excitement that they explored before.

In conclusion, a must watch for the family although I would advise younger audiences to watch the third film rather than this, then in time they can explore what this film has to offer to all."
The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,66,73,audience,"Although different in many ways to the book, it has redeeming qualities and makes the film more dramatic and engaging for the audience. Andrew Adamson proves he can work with an international cast and make movie magic and a fun watch for all the family"
The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,66,73,audience,"as good as the first one containing, another magical story, interesting new characters and a climactic and epic final battle. these first 2 movies are almost perfect and it's sad to see the 2 older people go."
The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,66,73,audience,"I really love this series, I don't know why others don't like it , ALSO WAITING FOR THE 4th MOVIE!!"
The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,66,73,audience,"A definitive downgrade on the first film, but this sequel still entertains to a good level.

'The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian' is a suitably entertaining production, if not an exceptional one; though it's not far off. I like the fresh new story and the fact that all four of the youngsters remain, but the change from dark, snowy settings to plain, summer-like conditions means the film does lose some spark. There's also much less intrigue with the villains.

Georgie Henley (Lucy), William Moseley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund) are again enjoyable in their roles. Liam Neeson, just barely, reprises his role of Aslan - his inclusion does feel forced, as great a character as he is.

Away from those four, you have a number of new faces. Ben Barnes (Caspian), Peter Dinklage (Trumpkin), Warwick Davis (Nikabrik) and Eddie Izzard (Reepicheep) are my standouts. Barnes is solid, I liked watching Caspian. Dinklage is great, while Davis and Izzard are welcomed newbies. Like the first film, the casting here is done astutely.

They definitely should've shortened this though, the ending does drag a fair bit. There's also a couple of different moments that feel like the end, yet evidently aren't - there's certainly more than a few pacing issues.

With all that said, I still had a more than decent time watching."
The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,66,73,audience,Terrible adaptation. They wasted valuable film time on ridiculous scenes that never were a part of the story. Caspian was far too old which ruined the premise of him being a prince and not yet a king. There is unnecessary conflict between Peter ans Caspian. Even small details like the DLF joje that could have been done right were screwed up because of laziness and general incompetence. This shit show is a disgrace and a spit in the face to Lewis and his story.
The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,66,73,audience,"No es tan buena como las otras dos, pero igual es un 10/10"
The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,66,73,audience,"Consideravelmente melhor que o primeiro.

Enquanto o antecessor focava um pouco no desenvolvimento dos personagens e suas relações em família - o que não deu muito certo -, o segundo se dá a alma que Narnia, como um reino, precisa.

A falta de harmonia não é mais um incomodo. Os novos personagens são ótimos, mesmo que não recebam tanta atenção quanto mereciam, na minha opinião. As cenas de ação são bem coreografadas, principalmente a batalha final. Mesmo que o duelo não seja dos melhores, foi interessante acompanhá-lo. A OST é ótima, como sempre. Junto com toda iconografia no que se diz respeito a magia de Narnia.

Fico feliz que o primeiro filme que assisti no cinema tenha como cast Peter Dinklage, que mesmo com menos da metade do potencial aproveitado, está muito bem. Liam Neeson também me agrada bastante. É impossível imaginar a voz de Aslam com algum dublador que não fosse ele."
The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,66,73,audience,"An entertaining and visually stunning follow-up, combined with Adamson's direction, the script he co-wrote with Markus and McFeely, the performances of the cast, Gregson-Williams' score, Lindenlaub's cinematography, Evan-Jones and Campbell's editing, Ford's production design, Brown's set decoration, Mussenden's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, Prince Caspian makes for a fantastical adventure back into the wonderous world of Narnia!!!"

Leatherheads,52,38,audience,"An enjoyable film with a story based loosely on Red Grange being signed by George Halas back in the day. It's a comedy; so, just enjoy the story, the actors, and the music."
Leatherheads,52,38,audience,"Entertaining, great cast."
Leatherheads,52,38,audience,"Best movie of all time. Leatherheads will baffle you with a jerk of a protagonist, an innocent antagonist, and a climax that makes no sense. I mean that final scene where Geoge Clooney cheats and lines up on the opponents side doesnt make a difference. I give this a 5/5. Very creative but I think the writer should try again."
Leatherheads,52,38,audience,"Leatherheads starts off as an amusing romantic comedy set in the early days of football, but then, about halfway through, it calls an audible and the tone of the movie shifts. Suddenly it's throwing in farce, slapstick and ambiguous moral conflicts. It's as if George Clooney stole the playbook for a Coen Brothers movie, but he didn't quite understand how to use it."
Leatherheads,52,38,audience,"Fast, witty banter, a true screwball comedy. Ahead of its time, hence the poor reviews from so many cynical reviewers"
Leatherheads,52,38,audience,"Think to an extent, this movie is a bit underrated.Clooney fits perfectly into this movie. I usually don't care what Ren'ee does but she was a fine choice for it. An entertaining ""football"" movie with good back and fourth banter that yes I do agree carries that ""nostaligia"" feeling with it but....well look at what it is based on...It should have some nostalgic feeling to it. I think there are some rather boring scenes but overall I found the movie pretty entertaining. With that said, that really shoudl be all that matters. It was enteraining, nothing really over the top besides the forced word play but i think that is what brought more laughs to it over stale faces. Not like I know how they talked back in the day though either ha."

Black and White,39,30,audience,"I gave this movie 2 stars kinda didn't want to though, this movie kinda reminded me of the movie Kids, but a adult version. Brooke Shields with cornrows, braids that was interesting and the parts with Mike Tyson and Rob. Downy Jr. was all off the cuff so it was kinda funny to find that out and watch that part. Gritty on the street type movie about different people and the way they live Brooke Shields plays a woman filming different people, small talk kinda slow would I would probably not watch this one again."
Black and White,39,30,audience,"The cast on this indie was a who's who of soon to be big leagues, with a simple plot and plenty of room to watch and dissect the problems that humanity still tends to have with inequalities ranging from genetic makeup to social status , ""Black and White"" is happily more than just a flick with a couple Wu-Tang cameos thrown in to exude star power. From the odd choices of editing in most scenes to the watermarks, the debauchary, Frodo let""s slip a slur a, Iron Man gets beat up by Mike Tyso and subsequently comes out the closet - all this as the audience is not only treated to a lesson on social structure from Method Man mid-film but also a Raekwon mini-music video at the end - ""Black And White"" is a sleeper that deserves an awake audience."
Black and White,39,30,audience,"Black and White doesn’t even hold together as a proper movie. It is like a series of vignettes that happen to features some of the same characters along the way. There is an attempt at a few little storylines, but most of it is scattered, and doesn’t have any flow at all. I despise that lack of focus and purpose, even in well-crafted movies, and this is far from well-crafted. It doesn’t properly take a stand on anything, and might be downright destructive in the way it presents its views. The theme is focused on the differences between white culture and black culture, and it includes a handful of white people who desire to cross the dividing line and either observe or be integrated into the black culture. The problem is that this movie seems to think that every stereotype about black men is accurate. All the black men are destructive, unfaithful, corrupting people who indulge in every vice and try to take down the poor misguided white people with them. It is so shocking that Black & White takes such a bold stand against an entire race, this movie kind of made my skin crawl. It approached some similar things with homosexuality, but it didn’t give the gay character enough screen-time to fully exploit him. I think it’s safe to say that I don’t think anyone should ever sit through Black & White, and those who made it should probably be a little ashamed."
Black and White,39,30,audience,"James Toback directs an extremely underrated film that plays out like a
slick, urban version of a Robert Altman piece. Things unfold like a
sledgehammer towards the end (I like how a rap music video carries the
closing credits into a sort of weird epiphany). The performances are
solid and the plot lines intertwine with a feverish tone. Black and
White got an extremely unfair ribbing from critics. I think it's
powerful stuff. 

In terms of the acting, Ben Stiller as the unacquainted lead, anchors
things and he deviates from his comedic persona to give a unhinge
performance. Also, look for a scene where co-stars Mike Tyson and
Brooke Shields share a weird and poignant moment. 

All in all, Black and White gets my full recommendation. See it again
(or for the first time) and give it its rightful due."

Perhaps you remember ""The Pick-Up Artist,"" the movie that single-handedly killed Molly Ringwald's career? That was another Toback production. ""Black and White,"" for all its arty pretensions and supposed shock value, doesn't break his losing streak.
 "
Black and White,39,30,critic,"
It doesn't try to spell out all aspects of the issue or arrive at any particular point. Toback presents specific characters dealing with specific problems and, through their stories, somehow manages to take the temperature of the times.

"
Black and White,39,30,critic,"
This movie doesn't provide the luxury of detachment; it forces us to sort out the confusing racial dramas of contemporary America, and it's far more involving because it has no narrator telling us what to feel.
 "
Black and White,39,30,critic,"
This lively mess proves that when Toback loses his head, he does it with style.
 "
Black and White,39,30,critic,"
A study in multiculturalism, Toback's film is something of a melting-pot itself: mixed-up, messy and teeming with vitality.
 "
Black and White,39,30,critic,"
Amateurish in the worst possible way and sorely lacking ideas or any sign of intelligent life.

Good: Themes and Tones, Acting and Characters, Direction, Editing

Fair: Plot, Dialogue

Poor: Score."
Titan A.E.,51,60,audience,"With dates CG that doesn't really blend with the traditional animation this film hasn't really aged all that well. However a strong cast, decent action and a few good original ideas still make it a fun watch."
Titan A.E.,51,60,audience,The animation is gorgeous especially considering the time it was made in. The voice actors were great too. You could tell there were a lot of talented people working on this film. The only downside is the story.  The movie isn't bad by any means the visuals and voice acting are great and the story is ok. I wish the writing was a little better the concept was good in idea they just didn't pull it off.
Titan A.E.,51,60,audience,"So what if it feels like a copy of every sci-fi movie ever?! That doesn't mean it's bad! Could use some work, but it's really enjoyable, hands-down."
Titan A.E.,51,60,audience,"It's a fun enough sci-fi adventure, with great animation (as usual with Bluth), but it doesn't do much outside of stringing together a bunch of space opera cliches. Some cool idea in it though."
Titan A.E.,51,60,audience,Fun sci fi movie. The concept of the dredge was hella cool. Overall some really interesting concepts!
Titan A.E.,51,60,audience,"I watched this movie a few days ago and I expected something like Cars, something that has a fanbase but is actually really bad. Turns out, yes it has problems, but I really enjoyed it. It's more adult than most animated films out there and the animation is spectacular. The second act has seriously flawed story structure, but the climax was a lot of fun. Check it out, but don't go into it with expectations, just see what you think of it"
Titan A.E.,51,60,audience,"Maybe it is because I was a young adult at the time, but this movie was memorable to me.  I really enjoyed it.  The animation was superb.  The story concept was intriguing .  The flaws I found were related to the fact that there is really no back story or motivation for why the events in the story even occurred.  That said,  the movie was a one off enjoyable feature film."
Titan A.E.,51,60,audience,"With regards to where Titan A.E. ranks among the trilogy of commercially unsuccessful animated sci-fi films of the early 2000's, I personally consider it to be better than Atlantis: The Lost Empire but inferior to Treasure Planet. It helps that this movie's narrative is more focused whereas in the former, by the time we get to Atlantis there's not enough runtime left to fully explore the world and its culture before we get to a big action-packed finale. Titan A.E. is not a bad movie, it's just confused. While there have been worse movies that had problems figuring out who their target audience is supposed to be, the criticisms about whether this movie was meant to be for kids or for teens are justified. On one hand, you have the smartass quips you'd expect from a Joss Whedon script as well as visible human bloodshed and even some surprisingly violent deaths. On the other hand, you have characters like that John Leguizamo alien who, from design, voice and mannerisms, are clearly intended to appeal to children, which can call more attention than was likely intended to the fact that this was a Don Bluth-directed film. Even the commercials reflected this uncertainty. Note that Earth blowing up is one of the earliest things even children get to see in the trailers. Regardless, Titan A.E. is definitely not lacking in the merits department. The visuals look great, especially given that the animators were working on a time crunch. Yes, there are moments when the animation looks unfinished but they do a good job integrating the 2D and 3D together for the most part allowing for some really cool angles at which to capture the action. The voice-acting for me is a bit hit-and-miss. It's not awful but sometimes the line delivery doesn't mesh well with the animation killing the mood. Other times, the voice acting works well for when anybody is speaking Whedon-ese. And while the story is rather paint-by-numbers by sci-fi standards, I can't say it wasn't lacking in its own interesting ideas such as beings made out of pure energy. The characters were definitely in need of a much better script. While I liked the Nathan Lane alien and the human characters just fine, the other two characters, while certainly not the most obnoxious, were clearly Don Bluth characters whereas the other four were Joss Whedon characters. World-building was interesting, if sparse. Doesn't help that most of the lore was shafted to a comic book and two different novels that not everybody is going to be reading. In conclusion, Titan A.E. had all the makings of an animation classic but what ultimately ruined it was inability to decide whether this was a Don Bluth movie or a Joss Whedon movie and wanting to prioritise one dimension of animation over another. At least the former got to enjoy three years of newfound success following his otherwise poor '90s output. Maybe one day that Dragon's Lair movie of his will finally see the light of day."

U-571,67,62,audience,"Alongside Pearl Harbor, Braveheart and The Patriot, this has to be in the running for the most historically inaccurate film ever made, not to mention the implied Anglophobia alongside Pearl Harbor (and a dishonourable mention for Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"") in completely failing to recognise the contribution made by any other allied nation in WWII (yes, I'm talking to you Stephen, there were other nations involved in D Day, in fact more non-US than US personnel) and the absolute blatant Anglophobia from the renowned Anti-semite, racist misogynist Gibson."
U-571,67,62,audience,"DAS BOOT  it is NICHT (NOT)  Ich  spreche Deutsch (I speak German)  This movie  has a good plot, but I think it could have been done much better. For me it was too rushed.  They do speak German in the beginning,  but most of it is in English. Some of the crew just didn't make me feel it was during  World war  2 in 1942. Characters could have been better developed. For me realism just wasn't there.  They were an inexperienced crew, but then suddenly everyone knows everything etc. The movie does have a lot of action,  I will give it that, This was a one time watch. It was exciting,but nothing I would  buy. It was a good try. You won't be bored."
U-571,67,62,audience,"If you could summarize the plot, you could make it about stealing credit from other countries and making one crime represent an entire military service.

While movie itself is good as a cinematic piece, the real crime is that it implies itself as being historically truthful while being quite the opposite. It takes the Kreigsmarine of Germany, who regularly aided their victims with provisions and makes them into callous war criminals. Factually, there was only ever ONE incident of U-boats shooting shipwrecked sailors in the entire war altogether, which the German Navy universally condemned upon discovery. So this serves to misinform the public audience with essentially fictional content. 

Second is that the British actually captured a different U-boat while the US never captured one at all. All these vessels had nothing to with any of the made up events. 

This movie may has nothing to do with the war, and should therefore be seen as what it is, an insult to veterans of all nations involved, falsification of history, and stolen valor."
U-571,67,62,audience,Not my cup of tea but it is exciting and intense. A great cast also help.
U-571,67,62,audience,"At a propagandic degree of heroic favoritism, it is genuinely inaccurate just to sell the story on a different turf as a composition of submarine films with atmospherically tense thrills and routine idealness that still honors the actual story in general through dedicated shots and decent, solidly-casted performances. (B+)"
U-571,67,62,audience,"Das Boot remains the definitive U-boat film, but the story here was interesting and kept me interested throughout. Not bad, but not great."
U-571,67,62,audience,"This submarine drama was pretty good. Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, Jake Weber, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job in this movie. This true story about capturing a German submarine and retrieve an enigma code machine was pretty dramatic and intense. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's worth seeing."
U-571,67,62,audience,"Okay Plot, Kinda cheesy underwater explosions, pretty good film"
U-571,67,62,audience,"These reviews are laughable. Roger Ebert's review is the only one who hits correct. 

This is a dumb movie, completely inaccurate, crediting the US with cracking the enigma when the UK had done it before the US even entered the war. 

Everything you see the Americans do in this film the British did. HMS Bulldog,  the story of British mathematicians and 
 Alan Turing, a Cambridge University mathematician and logician, provided much of the original thinking that led to the design of the cryptanalytical bombe machines that were instrumental in eventually breaking the naval Enigma. And of course all the people at Bletchley park. The true story is really interesting! But yet they think that US audiences wont watch it if they think there is a chance of suggesting the US didn't win the war all by themselves. 
Cryptanalysis of the Enigma was 'instrumental to an allied victory' according to Eisenhower, but it didn't happen like this. 

If you want to watch a good professional sub film watch Das Boot (1981) or even The Hunt for Red October (1990)
They are more likely to tell a good story with some truth to it."

My Salinger Year,78,74,audience,"There many themes in this movie, some about self-discovery and trust, some about risk-taking and personal growth.

My Salinger Year,78,74,audience,I really enjoyed this film.
My Salinger Year,78,74,audience,"That was awful, disjointed story telling. It manages to be simultaneously cheesy and flat. The soundtrack is so bad that it's actually distracting from what little story there is. 100% disappointed."
My Salinger Year,78,74,audience,"Very 'Devil Meets Prada' for literary nerds, but also shines on its own terms. 'My Salinger Year' is briskly paced, charmingly scripted, sprinkled with spunky humor, sports unexpectedly warm, colorful photography (with keen composition), and has breezy performances all around.

I'll have no complaints when Margaret Qualley's career takes off; she's endearing (decidedly not phony) and has got the goods to handle a range of roles, you can just feel it watching her. Sigourney Weaver is brilliant with her own spin on the Miranda Priestly prototype; shrewd literary agent Margaret is distinct - strict, but inherently flawed and never beyond reason (her aversion to technology is quite amusing).

'Salinger' is diverting and goes down like a fizzy cocktail."

Malcolm & Marie,58,68,audience,When it comes to these smaller films the most important aspect is the acting. John David Washington and Zendaya both gave phenomenal performances. The only flaw in this movie is that the story gets a little repetitive at points.

Malcolm & Marie,58,68,audience,"As this deep, well-acted, theatrical look into a relationship where jealousy and ego rule, Malcolm & Marie works well, but sadly there's not enough authenticity nor entertainment here to keep the viewer engaged long before a winner of this (unbearable self-absorbed) couple's dispute is settled. Zendaya makes Washington shine, there's no doubt about it.

The score by Labrinth's dope."

Each of them wants to feel the love and respect of the other, whilst their insecurities repeatedly have them questioning their motives. Intellectual - and at the same time base, real and relatable, cleverly written, superbly-acted, and masterfully directed, this is not what I expected at all"
Malcolm & Marie,58,68,audience,"Charisma gets you a long way and it is this inexplicable attribute, this inherent talent and undeniable magnetism that John David Washington possesses that carries writer/director Sam Levinson's latest endeavor so much further than it would have gone without the actor. Though unfamiliar with Levinson's HBO series, Euphoria, which also stars Zendaya it is evident from experiencing his 2018 film Assassination Nation along with this dissection of perspective in relationships and the constant battle for higher ground - principle or enviable - that Levinson is a writer who likes to put it all on the table. His previous feature was a garbage disposal of ideas that only succeeded part of the time, but Malcolm & Marie is very distinctly the opposite of that; at least from the outside looking in. 

Filmed last summer with a limited crew at the admittedly gorgeous Caterpillar House in Carmel, California Levinson's ""two people talking in a room"" movie was bound to become mercilessly harsh at one point or another and would need to make its way through countless topics in order to sustain a feature running time, but while Levinson has plenty of different things for our titular couple to discuss he doesn't have as many varying avenues through which to drive these conversations. In addition, Levinson has imbued his film with a sense of divine knowing when it comes to how critics - specifically the white guy from Variety, the white guy from IndieWire, and especially the white woman from the LA Times - will respond to and quantify his ""art"" into a handful of paragraphs that seek to interpret his film and his script for more than what it is. Such disdain is in reference to a film our protagonist has written and directed in the context of the film, but Levinson takes few pains to mask his intent as he takes said stance within the first five minutes only to go further into detail and reinforce his point some forty-two minutes later. For someone seemingly so caught up in the function of a film critic though - someone who seeks to better understand a piece of art - it would seem Levinson should understand he's only doing the same with his own thoughts by writing a script as a critic might do with his film by writing a review. Both are taking something born from the unconscious, spawned from nature and ideas that are completely subjective and attempting to unite them with an objective point of view, with reason, and with the intent to craft them into something conscious; something that can be defined. 

It is because Levinson explicitly mocks the seeking of an understanding (or maybe, more specifically, how that understanding is framed) only to then cycle through the same structure with (somewhat) different topics for the remaining hour and forty-five minutes that the introspection of his dialogue doesn't earn as much appreciation due to his lack of latitude for those he's already deemed himself superior to. Needless to say, it's a damn good thing Levinson has Washington speaking his decadent dialogue otherwise this exercise in freelance psychotherapy would have become completely devoid of any charm in a matter of minutes and would have undoubtedly enveloped itself in its own hedonistic nature - which it still does, just not completely - by the time Outkast finally plays us out of this toxic hellhole.

With The Impossible's Naomi Watts playing Sam, a mother of three and wife to Rick Andrew Lincoln's Cameron, she really should think twice before booking any more holidays in Thailand. This is a film that celebrates human resilience and how one comes to terms with and heals in the aftermath of a tragedy, via a clunky metaphor made physical that is an injured bird which the children nurse back to good health. You may roll your eyes at some of the heavy symbolism and sentimentalities it falls into but it will take a heart made of concrete to withstand the cute and well timed work achieved by the titular magpie (apparently 10 were used throughout the shot) which at times make me doubt if it's actually CGI. (It's not, though who knows how many takes they took!) The three child actors are natural enough and manage to get out of the way of the adults while the only real acting Lincoln has to do is to keep a firm grip on that Australian accent, as this is mostly the Naomi Watts show and she's fine here though it's familiar territory for her. The original Jacki Weaver (not that one who has the authority) also pops up as Sam's mother but there's not much for her to do either. Based on a true story, the film feels grounded though at times the signposting is hardly subtle. It's heart-warming, inspirational stuff and a nice effort by everyone involved, and while it's hardly unmissable (unless you love magpies), it's decent enough to fritter away 90mins on."
Penguin Bloom,67,69,audience,What an inspirational story! Sending love to Sam and her family.
Penguin Bloom,67,69,audience,Not fan of this drama.
Penguin Bloom,67,69,audience,Just Wow!!! Amazing movie! 
Penguin Bloom,67,69,audience,I loved this true story.  It is heartwarming and inspiring.  Naomi Watts is excellent as a woman who has to fight depression to get some semblance back of the life she once lived.  Andrew Lincoln is wonderful as the husband just trying to love and help her and his boys.

Watts is such a chameleon of an actress, such a pro at slipping into a vast array of roles without drawing attention to the mechanics of her work, that we almost take for granted how damn good she is - and she delivers beautiful and resonant work as Sam.

Pieces of a Woman,76,86,audience,Tough topic but wonderful acting and a great story!!
Pieces of a Woman,76,86,audience,"First 30 minutes are gruesome. Good movie dealing with difficult subject. The ending is so pathetic. They must have shot 3 possible endings, and then decided to put them all in to make everyone happy. The one they chose is so sappy it kinda ruined the movie."
Pieces of a Woman,76,86,audience,"The opening is flawless, the labor scene is perhaps the best one that I saw in every single movie, but the rest of the film does not takes advantage or even is that great just like its beginning. Still, it is the cast who carries the later acts, especially the great, quiet and stunning Vanessa Kirby, a returning to form Shia LaBeouf and Ellen Burstyn (incredible)..."
Pieces of a Woman,76,86,audience,"How do you deal with a loss that your body constantly reminds you was supposed to be a blessing? How does one do, concentrate, or consider anything else besides what they should have been doing in the weeks and months following? How does everything not simply feel like a waste of time? From the car you just bought to the child-like mannequins in the store windows to the room in your house that was meant to be theirs. The simple sight of a young girl signaling Martha's (Vanessa Kirby) body to begin producing milk. It's cruel, it' unimaginable, and it's made even worse when your most pressing questions have no satisfactory explanations. Even if they did though, they wouldn't ease the pain or heal the hurt. 

In Kornél Mundruczó's Pieces of a Woman the show-stopper is the opening, prologue-like birth sequence that contains all the anxiety, excitement, and physicality of an actual birth; never letting the air out of the room for an unbroken twenty-three minute shot that builds to a moment of blissful promise and then immediate pain. It is in the aftermath of this tragedy that Mundruczó's film with a screenplay by Kata Wéber focuses the rest of its energy. Martha doesn't express her grief outwardly. The self-blame, the shame, the guilt, and the aforementioned grief is all happening internally making Kirby's performance that much more impressive. We don't like to talk about death in general, never mind the death of a child, but this is mostly in fear of stirring up emotions those who've experienced such loss would rather not be reminded of in the moment. The issue goes deeper than simply talking about it though, as Martha's not even sure she herself knows how to express such grief in the first place; society doesn't know how to deal with such a tragedy, so how does she? This is naturally a rather isolating feeling, to suddenly lose this person you've been creating over the past nine months and both Wéber's screenplay and Kirby's performance genuinely capture the confusion and the helplessness of it all. Speaking of helpless, Shia LaBeouf is equally as impressive in an arc that is heartbreaking in its own right. 

The film begins on the fateful day of September 17th and moves spontaneously to different days over the course of the following months as a legal case is mounted against the midwife (Molly Parker) present on the night of the birth. This plotting is largely put in place due to LaBeouf's Sean and Martha's mother, Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn), craving some kind of justice which introduces the family lawyer into the mix as played by Sarah Snook. It's terrible to watch something so intangible and innocent as the love for a child be processed and formalized through something as structured and cold as the court system, but Mundruczó's flawless eye and specific aesthetic paired with Howard Shore's lovely yet restrained score make the difficulties in the minutia of the narrative easier to consider. As Martha drifts in the opposite direction in terms of managing her pain she and the remainder of her family find themselves at odds with one another about the path being taken. What's even more difficult to understand is how people can and why they try to force how they believe others should deal with traumas they haven't experienced in the way they believe is appropriate. It's evident in Burstyn's dramatic monologue (which she will undoubtedly win awards for) she only wants what is best for her daughter and to see her daughter come out of this life-altering event with as few scars as possible, but the fact of the matter is that this is a life-altering event and Elizabeth seems unable to accept the fact she couldn't shield her daughter from such pain.

I understand movies such as this are made not only to reaffirm those that have experienced such tragedy and trauma that they are not alone as well as to be able to work through something incredibly personal. Everyone has to find their own truth and own way of dealing with loss and it's rather courageous to seek this path instead of trying square away your grief into a category. It's a lone journey, but an ensemble loss and the film enlightens the viewer to these multiple perspectives and not only these different reactions to this same experience, but how it impacts these different people in completely different ways."
Pieces of a Woman,76,86,audience,"""Pieces of a woman"" è un ritratto introspettivo del disfacimento di una coppia all'apparenza felice, in seguito ad un tragico evento in cui non ci sono buoni e cattivi; soltanto sconfitti.
La prima, lunga scena sviluppata con un piano sequenza, cattura ed imprigiona lo spettatore fin dai primi secondi, con un crescendo di emozioni che scaturisce con l'evento che caratterizzerà tutto il film.
Purtroppo da quel momento in avanti, il film perde mano a mano ritmo, specialmente perchè tutti i personaggi feriti ed in difficoltà, si isolano andando a comportarsi in maniera poco razionale (ma credibile).
Questo però diminuisce l'empatia, e l'uscita di Shia Laboeuf non aiuta, seppur gli ultimi minuti con la sola e comunque strepitosa Vanessa Kirby le rendono la giustizia che merita."
Pieces of a Woman,76,86,audience,"Beautifully shot and superbly acted, Pieces of a Woman is a riveting look at the ravage of child loss, through sometimes its intentions can appear somewhat vague."
Pieces of a Woman,76,86,audience,"Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf star as Martha and Sean, a couple on the verge on having their first child. Vanessa insisted on having a home birth and before long, something goes terribly wrong and the baby is lost. Both attempting to move on, they handle the grief in their own ways and as such, drift further apart. Sean self-destructs while self-medicating, while Martha not only has to deal with the lose of her child, but her overbearing mother (played by Ellen Burstyn), who wants revenge against the midwife as she's made to be the scapegoat for the lose of the child. I really wanted to like the movie after viewing the trailer, but other than wonderful performances by both Kirby and Burstyn (I could see one or both get Academy nominations), the film seemed rather dull and sluggish at times, with the exception of the one shot birth scene in the beginning."
Pieces of a Woman,76,86,audience,"It made me cry in the first half hour of the movie. Beautiful, exciting, an important story to be told."
Pieces of a Woman,76,86,audience,"Pieces of a Woman is an exacting and yet poignant portrait of loss and grief. An extremely intense opening twenty minutes gives way to a considered portrayal of a relationship running to ground. The film is concerned with Martha and Sean, a couple living in Boston expecting their first child. They have decided to have a homebirth but when the time comes their midwife can't make it and they receive a substitute. Sadly there are tragic outcomes. This opening of the film is both exceptional and incredibly confronting. After the events we track through a year in the life of the couple, chronicling how they react emotionally. Sean wants revenge and compensation whilst Martha wants to move on. Also coming into the picture is Martha's mother, played with supreme skill by the iconic Ellen Burstyn, who has many issues with her daughter. This studied film though is not a grief fest though but more a perceptive look at how grief impacts people and how relationships can come asunder. Its strongest feature is the acting. Burstyn of course is wonderful but Shia LaBeouf is superb and Vanessa Kirby is blindlingly good in her role. This isn't light viewing but it is certainly worthy and admirable."
Pieces of a Woman,76,86,audience,"Powerful opening, just didn't find the rest of the film particularly engaging."

MLK/FBI,99,72,audience,Maybe the most boring documentary ever made. No new information. Exhaustingly long. Dreadfully bad. They uncover NOTHING new. How is this not universally panned? So bad.
MLK/FBI,99,72,audience,"""Looking at the FBI campaigns against King, the Black Panther party, and many other people I think there's a core component to this that really is structural and functional. People hold these attitudes and we focus on J. Edgar Hoover's own particular history and person, but I think that these are attitudes that have been core to how the racial order operates in the U.S.

What helped motivate these campaigns was the real fear that black people could undermine the way the country wanted to see itself. And this manifested itself not only in the targeting of leaders and the people that were visible, but of ordinary people. So, this core fear and aggression toward African Americans has a lot to do with white people's own conception of themselves and black people forcing a reckoning with the violence of the American past.""

Hot. Damn."

MLK/FBI,99,72,audience,"Horrible use of film who claims the focus was to ""shame"" the FBI for filming Dr. King but whose real intent was to cast shade/doubt on Dr. Martin Luther King's legacy. An abomination and disgrace to documentaries worldwide. Have some class, talk about good things in people and try it again! If we went after everything the writers of the film did that was bad, I'm sure we could easily frame a ludicrous picture of them as well. I'm requesting a refund."

'well, i don't care for him. he's too bossy. thinks he's too smart.' pretty much sums it up..."
MLK/FBI,99,72,audience,"When we turn our progressive leaders into Gods or demigods, and pretend they have no flaws... we ignore their humanity.  ""Respectability Politics"" (which makes marginalized people into squeaky clean, mainstream people - rather than humans with flaws) have forced us to make our leaders into perfect Supreme Gods.  

Turning our progressive leaders into gods, allows the power structures (who want to maintain the status-quo) to partake in clandestine activities that wish to expose the flaws of our progressive leaders, in order to tear them down.  

The FBI wiretapped MLK and they eavesdropped on him and found his flaws.  They then tried to use Martin Luther King Jr.'s flaws against him.  They did everything to destroy his character and the progressive movement he represented. 

This is not an excuse of MLK's flaws --- anyone saying that this documentary is trying to excuse MLK's flaws is twisting things around and not paying attention.  We all have flaws -- none of us are perfect.  That is the point.  But when a person's flaws are used to ""cancel"" that person out (whether the left or the right does it) it is ugly.  

In this instance, the FBI tried to do that to King, and this documentary dives into the history.   These are the things we are not taught in school.  MLK wasn't perfect. Gandhi wasn't perfect. Malcom X wasn't perfect.  No one is.  

This documentary is a reminder that each one of us, even with deep flaws and imperfections, must still do the work to make the world a better place.  And the ones who try to expose our flaws -- they do it because they have their own flaws that they don't want us to see.  

The FBI is a deeply flawed organization.  J. Edgard Hoover, its leader, was also flawed.

If you want to understand how power structures abuse their authority, I recommend this powerful documentary that takes a critical look into how the FBI (one of America's main power structure groups) did everything it could to stop Black leaders, communist leaders and anti-war activists.  

This is a critical look into America's overall right-wing history that tries to damage the character of leftwing, progressive leaders.  If you work for the FBI -- (or any police group -- or the CIA --- or any group like that) then that is even more reason for you to watch this documentary.  The only way to make the world a better place is by not perpetuating the abuse, by breaking the cycle."

In Gunda, a remarkably fine meat-is-murder documentary, director Victor Kossakovsky studiously avoids color, music, and quick editing and so pulls you into a world that seems found rather than made.

The Prom,55,64,audience,"Wow. I was not expecting that. I was not expecting anything at all, to be honest. Ryan Murphy has disappointed me lately, and this was not the case.

It was pure glittery, colorful fun. I guess that what I liked the most is that every single one of the characters transmitted the fun they must've had while filming this. I can't recall a time where I saw Meryl Streep having these amounts of fun (yeah, she sure did in Mamma Mia!, but this...), and Nicole being this sazzy (at least not since Moulin Rouge!). Every single one of them delivers what they should, in this heartwarming, timely, necessary, optimistic, and touching piece of musical magic. A bright and joyful way to end a weird, craaaazy year.

*Still not my favorite, but it's actually the first time I enjoy James Corden's performance.
*I urgently need every single one of the outfits in this movie (the glittier, the better).
*You may (will) cry."
The Prom,55,64,audience,"I didn't get to see the Broadway musical before it closed, but I found this movie very entertaining. The costumes and sets were appropriately colorful and spectacular. Jo Ellen Pellman reminded me of a young Drew Barrymore and her performance was excellent!"
The Prom,55,64,audience,"El gran Ryan Murphy de la mano de legendarias figuras de Hollywood! 
Esta espectacular comedia musical destaca por ser fresca y llevadera, debería considerarse de entrada un éxito a nivel de Grease o High School Musical."
The Prom,55,64,audience,It's a gay celebration with funny colorful characters and touchy stories.  Loved it and it's amazing message
The Prom,55,64,audience,There's a sweet story in there but the music isn't as good as it should be and the whole thing is about 45 minutes too long.
The Prom,55,64,audience,"Pumping up the gay stuff to unbearably ultra sugary levels, everything is too desperate to be camp, and becomes embarrassing to watch (and yes, I am gay). No redeeming qualities... to watch an actually good campy 2020 musical, go watch ""Valley Girl"" instead, more straightforward in its intention of paying tribute to the 80s without overcomplicating and exaggerating the stuff. Summary... Valley Girl is honest, The Prom is a wannabee"
The Prom,55,64,audience,The sucked. Turned it off before the first song was over. 
The Prom,55,64,audience,"Wow, what a film. This made me cry, laugh, smile and cry some more. It's just a truly feel good movie, it doesn't matter who you are and who you love just be yourself that's the message I got from this movie. Cordon's performance was just brilliant, his character had a background story that made you feel his pain and heartache. I was just amazed with everything the singing, dancing and music was beautiful. I will be watching this again and recommending it to everyone. In my eyes it's a 10/10."
The Prom,55,64,audience,"The acting and the story are strong but I think the songs are forgettable, old-fashioned and drag everything to a halt."
The Prom,55,64,audience,"I really enjoyed this movie! I loved the colorful visuals that it had, and the songs were entertaining and catchy. The message that goes along with the film is also amazing, and I think anyone would get a joy out of it if you enjoy musicals. All of the cast performed beautifully and did an awesome job."
The Prom,55,64,critic,"
The Prom reflects its characters: full of good intentions but lacking in execution. Those just looking for a ridiculous couple of hours won't mind one bit, but for a story about such an important topic it's missing the impact that should be there.

...for a film supposedly about finding your identity, The Prom offers nothing but fifty flavours of sell-out...
 "
The Prom,55,64,critic,"
Like many a stage musical, the new musical film The Prom can be broken into two acts. And as with many a show that has graced stages from Broadway to London's West End, its first act is a lot more entertaining than its second.
 "
The Prom,55,64,critic,"
So why does the film fall short? The answer is overproduction and slickness.
 "
The Prom,55,64,critic,"
The whole movie tries to balance the elitist, self-serving nature of these people against their desire to help someone. This delicate balance is handled clumsily.

The Prom,55,64,critic,"
Alas, The 'Prom' is a little too slick. Murphy loses the camp that made the story's silliness acceptable on Broadway. It's easy (and fun) to leave common sense behind when you're watching a staged show. It's harder onscreen.

Stardust,19,31,audience,"I tried I really did. Poor Marc. He was great. He was the only thing keeping me interested. This movie had no budget kinda like the storyline. I kept seeing the same exact cars in different places. The music chosen to open scenes was unnerving. What moron would keep essential paperwork scattered about in a car? 
 The main lead who played Bowie should have researched his role/character better if at all. He's one of those over reactive actors. Horrendous in every way. I haven't seen a movie this bad since Ishtar! I should've checked with my Bowie friends before I wasted my time. This is a warning. Don't waste your precious time."
Stardust,19,31,audience,"Great movie! Maybe someday, it'll be more respected. "
Stardust,19,31,audience,David Bowie was an Artist. This film was not artistic. David Bowie carried great cultural significance in his message and convictions. This film said nothing and caused me to drift off. David Bowie is still worshipped by many. This film was sacrilegious.
Stardust,19,31,audience,"So the secret's out. This movie was about the poorly fashioned orange yarn wig from props that magically transformed Bowie into the alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The movie does nothing to flesh out the influences that inspired him to this end, or beginning. Instead the film makers hacked into Bowie's insecurities, inability to hold normal interviews, highlighting a lot of whining not to mention eye rolls from the press. It makes me wonder if the film makers who couldn't get the rights to Bowie's music were so sore that they pressed on without it and for kicks left a whole portion of the movie on the cutting room floor. And honestly, the absence of the music? What else will these guys come up with, ""Dylan-no lyrics""...Can't wait."
Stardust,19,31,audience,"Ignore the bad reviews because it is painfully obvious that those folks do not get David Bowie, his early struggles to break into major stardom, or his insecurities and fears about his family's (including his half brother Terry) history of mental illness.  This movie is a very thin slice of the David Bowie story, and probably not one many casual fans know about, or maybe even care to much to learn about?  Marc Maron is absolutely stunning as the late, great Ron Oberman,  the record label rep that took Bowie under his wing when he first came to the USA. Admittedly,  the movie didn't get the nod from the Bowie camp or feature lots of his big hit songs, but it is a wonderful little film that was extremely well done and worth seeing...It is truly staggering to me that this movie is not better reviewed...Do your homework on Bowie's early story,  manage your expectations that you are going to see something like the Queen or Elton flicks, and enjoy what is truly a terrific look at Bowie's progression to the Ziggy Stardust era of his career.   This movie deserves so much more praise than it is getting."
Stardust,19,31,audience,"what a dull mess ! honestly, this snooze-fest is an abomination to the genius of who David Bowie is, the director is so out of his league on this 'pseudo-biopic' for a music legend such as Ziggy Stardust. Seriously, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and 'Rocketman' have been far better executed than that movie, it make Gabriel Range look like a freaking amateur as he completely missed the mark, even on a shoestring budget. Obviously, Bowie's family has disavowed this feature film, so of course no original songs are spread out through out this boring flick. David Bowie fans should and must avoid this insult of a celluloid disaster at all cost."
Stardust,19,31,audience,"There is something beautiful about this film  : it's about an artist finding himself, the relationship between creativity and mental health,  and the failures you endure to succeed. Ignore idiot critics : David's music would have made this even better, but it's a mark of how good it is that it works without it. Even if Marc Bolan looks like a cross between a tansvestite trucker and Bonny Prince Charlie."
Stardust,19,31,audience,Marc Maron was great in this movie
Stardust,19,31,audience,Total Meh. Main problem is just too old and uninspired main actor. Don't ask me to watch another Johnny Flynn movie.
Stardust,19,31,audience,"This is an amazing film about one year in David Bowie's life, 1971, just before he became the iconic Ziggy Stardust. Johnny Flynn does a stunning job portraying the young Bowie. The story is about Bowie touring the USA with publicist Ron Oberman, attempting to promote his album under the most challenging circumstances. Bowie and Oberman have to work together to overcome the skepticism of David's album from the record company and the public. In facing these challenges and potential failure, we watch Bowie find his way, inventing and developing himself as an artist. Especially poignant are the scenes where David spends time with his brother, who faces the challenges of Schizophrenia. This is a thoughtful and sensitive portrayal of a turning point in an artist's life."
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
If you compare Stardust to Bohemian Rhapsody or Rocketman ... then this David Bowie drama is like a rare groove B-side.
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
An unauthorized David Bowie biopic without the music begs the question, what's the point?
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
As a true-to-life biopic Stardust doesn't really make the grade, and Bowie fans may need to hold their nose, but there's an interesting piece lurking beneath Johnny Flynn's wig. It's just probably not the one you're looking for.
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
...a small, intelligent drama that riffs creatively on the legend of David Bowie...
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
Stardust is a startlingly conventional movie about a man who was anything but.
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
If it is possible to make a good David Bowie film without any David Bowie music-and without the blessing of Bowie's family-then this certainly isn't it.
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
The low budget leads to an unconvincing re-creation of the period, and the film does a terrible job of capturing the hippie era's tail end as it faded into something new.
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
There's a loose, scruffy charm to this biopic about a pivotal moment in David Bowie's life.
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
Absolute Beginners might have done a better job.
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
The film stumbles between moods, caught between overt mythmaking and something closer to historical detail, which leaves an enjoyable but incomplete picture of the great musician's life.
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
The whole thing feels strangely pedestrian, unable to capture or channel Bowie's maverick spirit.
 "
Stardust,19,31,critic,"
A by-the-numbers biopic that does a disservice to its star and subject, and sorely missing a killer soundtrack. Watch The Man Who Fell To Earth instead.

STARDUST isn't entirely without merit, but it lacks the cryptic charisma of its subject; something that might distract from a disjointed and inconsequential narrative.

Exasperating viewing for fans and certain to baffle newcomers, it's a curious, imaginative thing, but who exactly is it for?

Stardust fails to do justice to musical icon David Bowie, with the lack of his back catalogue feeling especially absent, along with an inability to capture his unique and otherworldly essence.

Flynn carries off Bowie's clothes and delicate mannerisms plausibly enough and, impressively, he does his own singing. But, all too often, this Bowie looks as if he is presenting TV's Bake Off.

Zappa,95,75,audience,"I knew little to nothing about Frank Zappa going in and now I don't know if anything has ever re-contextualized the music industry, especially in the 60's, like this Alex Winter-directed doc. 

Seemingly captures the genuine essence of a guy who was near impossible to pin down.

Would love to write more about this film and Zappa himself after digging more into the man's life and work as well re-visiting the film again afterward."
Zappa,95,75,audience,"As seen through Winter's electric and incisive new documentary, Zappa's ethos is situated somewhere between a libertine aestheticism and a libertarian egoism: This is not so much ""art for art's sake"" as it is ""art for the artist's sake."" For Zappa, art that aims to appeal to its audience is ultimately as corrupt and senseless as its audience—hence, in an aesthetic epoch as asinine and alienated as ours, art should itself be alienate its audience and embrace something of the asinine. Winter does much to draw a distinction in this regard between Zappa's outsider eclecticism and the Beatles' popularity, but I think here is where the outlook shows its limitation—didn't the Beatles themselves stop touring and reject their audience at the very height of their celebrity, going so far as to ""perform"" under a different name (SPLHCB) and release what ultimately amounts to the most widely listened to (and frequently skipped) avant-garde music on their self-titled record, even more so than Zappa's?"
Zappa,95,75,audience,A good introduction to the provocative musical pioneer and social commentator with international influence that was Frank Zappa.
Zappa,95,75,audience,"If you have heard any Zappa at all, it's a requirement to see this.  If you haven't, you might not enjoy it quite as much, but it's still enjoyable as hell.  It encapsulates him perfectly, showcasing all of his strengths and all of his flaws and how they came together to release 62 albums plus enough extra material to release 54 + who knows how many more posthumous releases.  Truly a giant."
Zappa,95,75,audience,I still don't think he was all that but definitely good for what he was and did
Zappa,95,75,audience,"This movie is a fascinating overview of Frank's work, and provides some insight into the uncompromising iconoclast that *clearly* was always pursuing the capture of the ""music"" he heard in his head, over pursuit of any form of popular musical success."
Zappa,95,75,audience,"Why is everyone treating this like a unique documentary created soley by Winter? The documentary simply splices together various existing interviews and concert footage or at least 90% of it is. That being said, it is what it is. If you're a Zappa fan, you already know most of what's been presented. Even though there were only a few new nuggets i picked up, it was enjoyable to see these previously filmed bits spliced together to create a new whole. Finally, if you're a fan enough to notice that, for instance, certain albums and time periods were missed or gone over quickly, what do you care? You've seen them already"
Zappa,95,75,audience,"Genios workaholics como Zappa son pocos y muchos pasan inadvertidos. Este documental muestra la carrera de Zappa, el genio, pero poco profundiza en Frank. Es muy bueno porque muestra lo brillante que fue y todo lo que nos dejó, pero poco dice sobre quien (realmente) fue. En todo caso, gran tributo al esplendoroso Frank Zappa."
Zappa,95,75,audience,A nice in depth look into the amazing talent and life of Frank Zappa.  I liked it!
Zappa,95,75,audience,"The theater staff, while polite and apologetic, was unable to show the movie that was advertised, disappointing to say the least!"
Zappa,95,75,critic,"
A full account of how Zappa ran his own race throughout a dizzying, intermittently brilliant career that flitted across the mainstream and alternative music scenes is lovingly dispatched in Alex Winter's excellent, absorbing, long-belated profile.
 "
Zappa,95,75,critic,"
Lively, detailed and riveting, this documentary attempts the difficult feat of condensing Frank's life and impact into 129 minutes - and, regardless of whether you're already a fan or not, it does an impressive and engaging job.
 "
Zappa,95,75,critic,"
... moderately fluid as well as competently organized and edited... Zappa fans won't want to miss this.
 "
Zappa,95,75,critic,"
It makes a very good case that you should be interested in Zappa's work.
 "
Zappa,95,75,critic,"
If there is one American musician who was overdue for a comprehensive documentary, that's Zappa -- and this one doesn't disappoint. It's as messy as his music in parts, but that fits.
 "
Zappa,95,75,critic,"
Key to the success of the film is the editing, a pinballing assault of free association, claymation and gleeful profanity, which goes some way towards recreating what it must have been like to spend time inside Zappa's head.
 "
Zappa,95,75,critic,"
Winter has simply collated the resulting audio and video recordings into more than two hours of slightly sophomoric Zap-tastic musings on the pointlessness of commercial music, the need to fight the system and the tediousness of mainstream success.
 "
Zappa,95,75,critic,"
Winter has created a fascinating watch.
 "
Zappa,95,75,critic,"
An excellent exploration into the stern, eccentric ways of Frank Zappa and his pursuit for musical perfection

Zappa touches on so many aspects of Frank Zappa's too-short life and career that, by the end, one realizes that although a greatest hits collection is an entertaining overview, Zappa really deserves a box set.

The definitive biopic doc long awaited by Zappa fans.
 "
Zappa,95,75,critic,"
Winter's doc can't hold a candle to any of the musician's best songs or climactic symphonies... The good news is that Winter seems to have recognized that from the start, and made a certain peace with the low ceiling of his film's conventional structure.

Fatman,45,84,audience,"Stop looking for a Best Picture award and sit back and just enjoy the movie.  Mel's take on Santa is ""real"".  The hardships of running a business along with the way kids are now a days takes a toll on the Fatman.  Ruth is another very relatable character.  As for being a comedy well, I don't know about that.  I would classify it as a good old fashion action flick, with a smidge of dark humor.  I really enjoyed this movie and I believe that if you don't take it too seriously then you will too."
Fatman,45,84,audience,I had fun watching this movie! The idea of Santa this way was intriguing. Mel Gibson and Marianne Jean-Baptiste did a good job of bringing the characters to life. I'd watch a sequel if the story was right.
Fatman,45,84,audience,ridiculous waste of a movie.  Is hollywood out of ideas?
Fatman,45,84,audience,Mel Gibson plays an acholic Santa in a gritty Christmas movie. That's all you need to know
Fatman,45,84,audience,"Before 2020 ended they had to release this movie lol, fit in perfect.  Reminded me of Scrooged movies of Santa's workshop being attack by terrorists.  But this is an actual full movie, if you leave what's going on in the world at the door it's a great movie.  Though are some undertones I didn't care for but it's Hollywood."
Fatman,45,84,audience,"Gibson really works in this role. This could have been the first of a series of films. The direction seems inspired but there are times it's obvious that we are dealing with a new director here. A greenhorn so to speak. He's hesitant even when he hits the right notes, on which he should be confident. And this hesitance ultimately affects the overall development. However, the story is well suited to be told by a noob. It's simple as a snowman right down to the buttons and carrot nose. All the pieces are larger than life. It's truly a puzzle of 100 pieces to put together. At the end of the day, I found what it had to say was something that not everybody wants to hear, and for that reason the darker aspects of the humor work very well."
Fatman,45,84,audience,"Hahaha, this movie is funny, in that weird kind of way you don't expect.  First the premise is a little out there.  Kid didn't get what he wants under the tree last year, so, yeah, let's knock off the big guy.  If you were expecting a serious or even christmassy movie after this, then yes, you might want to look in the mirror and start the process of self-realization of why you have no freinds, or are a professional movie critic, sheesh you went to college, and this is it?
Anyway, getting back to the movie...yes it is slightly off-kilter, and yes it a new way to look at things, and yes I say ""and yes"" way too much (or yeah), but for my wife and I it was very enjoyable throughout.  We loved it.  We laughed.  Actually we watched it right after Christmas, which is (yes) I think the best time to actually watch something a little more crass, or a little more down at the corners of the mouth.  Mel Gibson kills it making Mr. Claus self-deprecating and ah shucks at the same time.  A simple charachter is built for the jolly old man, but some hidden secrets await those in for a penny and in for a pound.  Watch it if you are feeling glib around the holidays."
Fatman,45,84,audience,"I wanted to love this but the performances (outside of Mel Gibson) were awful, the story dragged, the characters were one dimensional and, although magic was alluded to, no magic was shown (except fast healing).
Re-edited, recast and a few special effects added could have turned an interesting premise into something truly magnificent."
Fatman,45,84,audience,great movie. mel gibson still got it. go see it.
Fatman,45,84,audience,Santa was a badass! 
Fatman,45,84,critic,"
Despite a scene-stealing Walton Goggins, Fatman doesn't quite succeed tonally. The ultra-dry humor lurks around the edges, in small ornamental details. Overall, the clever concept is better than the execution.

Fatman is an exhausting, vile, depressingly boring movie which might have been kinda funny as a skit or short.

Mel Gibson plays a non-traditional Santa Claus in this R-rated dark comedy and I was here for it.
 "
Fatman,45,84,critic,"
The movie very quickly becomes a big mistake, with no wit apparent and a repugnant ultra-violent streak that should have been tamed.
 "
Fatman,45,84,critic,"
Aren't most people expecting a campy action film with a wink at the camera? Not a mean spirited gritty Santa action movie like Fatman is? No thanks.

The Invisible Man,91,88,audience,"Some viewers may find this Australian movie offensive, but not me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
The Invisible Man,91,88,audience,"A modern take on the 1933 horror film of the same name as well as a social commentary on the horrors of domestic abuse. The story really worked in that regard as this is definitely a psychological horror film rather than you're typical slasher. Elisabeth Moss gives a wide range performance as Cecilia, a young woman who escapes from her abuser but who is able to ""cheat death"" to continue harassing and abusing her. However, as the story plays out, it becomes repetitive: Cecilia says her abuser is not dead but is still terrorizing her and since no one can see her, they victim blame her and make her feel as if she's losing her mind until she finally outsmarts him and proves to everyone she's not insane. Again, a good modern take on the story that probably could have been cut down some and doesn't finish particularly strong."
The Invisible Man,91,88,audience,Elisabeth Moss was great but the plot holes and really bad dialogs make the film unbearable
The Invisible Man,91,88,audience,"The main character was annoying the whole movie, the plot twist wasn't surprising, in fact, there probably shouldn't have been a plot twist at all. Worst of all the plot wasn't good and the movie wasn't scary. I loved the idea of the invisible man but the execution was terrible."
The Invisible Man,91,88,audience,"extremamente envolvente e cheio de adrenalina e suspense. A trama focando no misterio desde o inicio deixa tudo melhor, a forma como trabalham o abuso que a protagonista sofre deixa o telespectador aflito e temente pelo bem estar dela e quando chega o segundo ato esse sentimento se instala permanentemente"
The Invisible Man,91,88,audience,A well done modern reimagining of a classic movie monster.
The Invisible Man,91,88,audience,This movie just feels weird from beginning to end but you do get the sense that it is the kinda weird that a movie about the invisible man should feel like.  Ending was kinda ‘meh' though.

The Invisible Man,91,88,audience,Excellent suspense drama with wonderful twists and great acting.
The Invisible Man,91,88,audience,What the world didn't need in 2020? a woke invisible man movie. All the recent Universal Monsters films have been stinkers.... will the new creature from the black lagoon save us all? Can't be worse than this stinker!

This film - with its science-fiction slant - delivers scares and works as a heightened examination of obsession and an abusive relationship.

Leigh Whannell's update of the classic concept stars Elisabeth Moss as the ex-girlfriend of a millionaire inventor turned high-tech gaslighter whose goal is to erase his victim's humanity as effectively as he has obscured his own visibility.

It's doubtful any of The Invisible Man would work so well ... without Moss.

The Invisible Man,91,88,critic,"
Staring, waiting, preparing for the worst creates the most unease in the viewer ... Whannell's script is equal parts action, suspense and surprise. He doesn't go for the easy scare, and much of the film is anxiety-inducing, not seat-jumping.

The Assistant,92,25,audience,"What a WASTE OF LIFE! I kept thinking to myself ""something must happen sooner or later."" Alas nothing. I have never seen a worse movie in my life. All that happened was, the girl went to work, then at the end of the day, she went home. No conflict, no resolution, absolutely NOTHING HAPPENED! Worst movie ever!"
The Assistant,92,25,audience,"A catastrophe divided between the personal, the work and the toxic, since Julia Garner explores that world in a very stressful and dangerous way, while delivering one of the most realistic performances I have seen, and if you have experienced something like this in a job, The Assistant is not for you, but if you want to see how a person with a university degree suffers and with two months working, just like you, you will be interested to know more about this film."
The Assistant,92,25,audience,"Smart enough to not focus on the person in question, but the machinery set-up around that person and those on the other side of his always closed door, Kitty Green's The Assistant is deliberate to a fault. While a story of power and consent this is a story of power and consent told by and from the point of view of a woman. There's no gratuitous and/or sensationalized scenes of what happens beyond closed doors, but instead we remain with a lowly clerk who makes copies, gets lunch, and tidies up after meetings. Nothing here feels exploitative for the sake of such despite the subject matter, but rather Green paints a delicate portrait of Julia Garner's Jane whom no one notices, but whose every internal conflict and struggle is all we see. Garner has an amazing presence that translates almost everything we need to know about what the character is feeling without hardly saying a word.

In the similarly themed Promising Young Woman the style is more heightened, but the situations aren't - they're very real and regrettably commonplace - and The Assistant operates in this same area where everything that occurs feels oddly ordinary, unpleasantly familiar, and certainly possible. Green sets her film within the world of the film industry (a detail I initially thought was the wrong - or maybe too much the obvious - choice), but what saves this for general moviegoers is that Jane doesn't necessarily have to be working for a powerful Hollywood producer as this could easily transfer to any other corporate environment. The Assistant is a film made up of small, specific moments that - while not driving towards anything grand or set in stone - analyzes a culture gone awry; lost to the conditions of those in power and where the idea of simple human decency quickly fades away."
The Assistant,92,25,audience,"Solid little movie. I work in the film industry, so definitely connected on some level. Solid concept, solid execution."
The Assistant,92,25,audience,It was a day in the life of MUNDANE. The previews are misleading!!! Don't waste your time.
The Assistant,92,25,audience,"If you get past the first 30 minutes of nauseating, mundane and emptiness of acting and story you will be rewarded with more white people thinking about oppression and harassment in narrow ways. Do yourself a favor and keep moving... Nothing to see here."

English Review

We share a day at the work of Jane (Julia Garner), assistant to an important film producer, in a company with a work environment that is becoming abusive and toxic.

This is documentary filmmaker Kitty Green's first fiction film, and you can see that look in this extraordinary film.

It is remarkable how the story immerses us in the routine work of Jane, a young university student, efficient and who gives her all, and how little by little she reveals, almost like in a horror movie, what underlies what she is perceiving. The immersion experience for the viewer in this work reality, first harmless, is total. Our point of view is always that of Jane, which allows a ""lateral"" look at what is being revealed and also feel with her the mistreatment that she herself suffers or perceives.
Jane brings us reminiscences of Elisabeth Moss's Peggy in Mad Men.

All this Green achieves with his surgical detail as a documentary filmmaker, an absolute elegance in the frames, an intelligent use of medium shots or details and a masterful use of the off-field (see footnote).

Due to all these characteristics and the nature of its protagonist, The Assistant is located in the antipodes of the Hollywood scandal (Bombshell, the well-known ""based on real events""), making the approach to the issue of harassment and labor abuse much more daily and disturbing.

Julia Garner does an extraordinary and subtle job, with her lonely Jane who is recording and feeling everything that happens around her, all the time on screen and at work, almost without being able to peek into her private life, speaking little and telling us everything .

SEMISPOILER NOTE: we never see Jane's boss, since he always stays out of the field.

Reseña Español 

Compartimos un día de trabajo de Jane (Julia Garner), asistente de un importante productor de cine, en una empresa con un ambiente laboral que se va revelando abusivo y tóxico descripto con precisión quirúrgica. 


Esta es la primera película de ficción de la documentalista Kitty Green, y se nota esa mirada en este extraordinario film.

Es notable como el relato nos va sumergiendo en la rutinaria cotidianeidad laboral de Jane, una joven universitaria, eficiente y que da todo de sí y cómo de a poco va revelando, casi como en una película de terror, lo que subyace en lo que ella va percibiendo. La experiencia de inmersión para el espectador en esa realidad laboral, primero inofensiva, es total. Nuestro punto de vista es siempre el de Jane, lo que permite una mirada ""lateral"" de lo que se va revelando y también sentir con ella los maltratos que ella misma sufre o percibe. Jane nos trae reminiscencias de la Peggy de Elisabeth Moss en Mad Men.

Todo esto Green lo logra con su detallismo quirúrgico de documentalista, una elegancia absoluta en los encuadres, un inteligente uso de los planos medios o detalle y un empleo magistral del fuera de campo.(ver nota  al pie)


Por todas estas características y la naturaleza de su protagonista, La asistente se ubica en las antípodas de la hollywoodense El escándalo (Bombshell, la consabida ""basada en hechos reales""), en un abordaje que torna el tema del acoso y el maltrato laboral mucho más cotidiano y perturbador.
Julia Garner realiza un trabajo extraordinario y sutil, con su solitaria Jane que va registrando y sintiendo todo lo que ocurre a su alrededor, todo el tiempo en pantalla y en su trabajo, casi sin poder asomarnos a su vida privada, hablando poco y diciéndonos todo.

NOTA SEMISPOILER:  al jefe de Jane no lo vemos nunca, ya que siempre permanece fuera de campo."
The Assistant,92,25,audience,"Incredibly stale film. Feels like a glorified student project. It’s lack of any music or nondiegetic sound in lieu of droning office noises, jarring buzzes, and overly compressed ambience over nicely lit visual shots for an hour and a half lend a boring aesthetic to an even worse plot line. The film is vague in its meaning and delivery of criticism of the toxic Weinstein culture that has permeated Hollywood since its foundation. The positive was Jane, the main character’s performance. It’s lack of consideration for plot development was nihilistic at best and almost offensive as I struggled to make it through the anticlimactic ending. Unmemorable. "
The Assistant,92,25,audience,"Conspicuously naturalistic and something of a Rorschach test, but works well nevertheless.  
[Mild Spoilers]
As a meditation on how naturally we all tend to fall into soul-calcifying complicity.  Hence the title.  Without countless dedicated such 'assistants' (including many of the girls themselves) busy holding their positions within their very own little hamster wheels - systems like Weinsten's (and Stalin's for that matter) don't become animated.  
A 'Swimming With Sharks meets Compliance and tones itself way tf down' type deal.
Macfayden especially, is glorious here."
The Assistant,92,25,audience,I watched this movie and finished it with a bit of fast forwarding. Julia Gardner is one of my favorite actors. And her acting was excellent. But the movie was very very slow and boring.
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
Like a suspenseful horror film, Green doesn't reveal the monster in the light of day, but his presence and influence are always felt.

The Assistant is Julia Garner... only because of her [the film] would deserve the five stars. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
The Assistant is compelling, and a clarion call for others to hold people in authority accountable for their actions.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
...a quiet, restrained condemnation of the kind of male behaviour which still provides a huge hurdle to any notions of workplace equality...
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
The Assistant is a searing portrait of the Weinstein power dynamic. But its strength is that it could be any exploitative workplace.
 "

Whatever connections we choose to make, this could be any office, anywhere.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
""The Assistant"" is a stealth bomb of a movie: It barely makes a noise but it leaves a crater in your heart.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
Although the film addresses #MeToo, it's also a thoughtful study of power and complicity, as well as what people will do to get ahead in a cutthroat industry.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
Based on hundreds of interviews with real-life assistants, this is more than just a movie, it is a timely document of abuse of power and complicity.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
It's the first great movie of the new decade.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
Despite the lack of excitement you would expect to find in a film like this, it does keep us on the edge of our seats, hopeful that the perp is caught and the women liberated.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
Green has the confidence of a filmmaker who knows she need not make anything explicit in order to shake you to your core.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
Director Kitty Green does an extraordinary job of saying a lot with very little. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
The Assistant is brilliant because it is told through small actions that speak of a big and very real problem. [Full review in Spanish]
 "

...a meditation on the passing of time, the many faces of staying in place, and the pursuit of happier and healthier endeavors in the new year.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
Kitty Green's 'The Assistant' is not a movie that captivates me for an hour and a half, but it does have an interesting commentary on working life and sexual harassment within the film industry. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
A hard, nerve-wracking watch, but it earns every bit of it.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
... the taciturn drama poignantly expresses the miserable work environment that many people experience but haven't the courage to denounce.
 "
The Assistant,92,25,critic,"
This compact, almost Bressonian narrative feature by Kitty Green, an Australian non-fiction filmmaker now in Brooklyn, has a dark, tense force it keeps in place through minimal dialogue in limited settings.
 "
63 Up,98,93,audience,Wonderful follow-up in the series. I started watching with 21-Up and have been rooting for everyone in the study ever since. Very well done.
63 Up,98,93,audience,"I have already seen all the other 7 Up films, and I always eagerly anticipate each new film. This one did not disappoint. One gets very invested in the lives of the subjects, and it was nice to see how well most of them are doing."
63 Up,98,93,audience,"I have seen all of the films in this series, and hope the series will continue!"
63 Up,98,93,audience,"With Its utter uniqueness into the human and  emotional qualities of everyday life ,  the Up series should be considered the Rosetta Stone of reality film. Long before the Loud family, ""Boyhood"" and the continuous roll out of the bio-pics, Apted and the gang continue to explore the English class system in ""63 Up.""  Am a little concerned that this may be the last Up we get.  Rest in peace Lynn Johnson. (1-26-20)"
63 Up,98,93,audience,"This feels like a summing up of the many themes explored throughout the Up series which follows a hand full of Britons from the time they were seven years old. The fourth wall really comes down at times as the subjects interact with director Michael Apted, challenging and questioning his agenda directly. But fundamentally this is a celebration of the common man and woman, a chronicle of what these people go through in life as a surrogate for what we all go through. It's brilliant and riveting."
63 Up,98,93,audience,"I’m not sure when I first saw this series. Maybe at 49? But watching these people grow up, in 7 year installments, at exactly my age, is incredibly intriguing. What a project to start. And I hope I’ll get to see 70 Up. "
63 Up,98,93,audience,"Because of the 7-year rule, it jumps all over the place, at the 7-year intervals, following different individuals, pretty much randomly. So, it's really not smooth.  It's an OK film."
63 Up,98,93,audience,Anyone who spent time with the Up series can’t help but feel gratitude for the generosity of the subjects and the unimaginable ways working on this project has impacted each of their lives. Among the many reasons to celebrate this as one of the great works in cinema history is the way Apted and team have edited each of the seven year episodes to be both self-containing and cumulative to the iterative experience for those of us lucky enough to have seen them all.
63 Up,98,93,audience,Have seen every reincarnation of this series since 7up in 1965.  The three hours flew by with remarkable speed... The quality of the social study documentary series continues to maintain a very high level of entertainment and erudition
63 Up,98,93,audience,Not as trenchant as the earlier entries in the series.
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
With each installment, and each passing seven-year period, I find myself growing more attached to these people, and less prepared to say goodbye.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
Watching 63 Up as a stand-alone endeavor may not seem remarkable. In fact, it may even be a little boring. But watching it as part of the larger picture imbues it with immediacy and power.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
In the span of a minute, we see a hopeful young boy grow into a disaffected young man, then into a mellowed older man. It's impossible not think of ourselves, our parents and our children, and how quickly life happens to us.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
There is a touching universality to these life stories, which at this point have a lulling near-sameness...
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
With 63 Up, the quiet wonder of simply executing such a project reigns -- the potentially mundane resonates profoundly when watching a human life arc or veer before your eyes.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
At first glance, 21 Up played as somewhat of a novelty. That was over forty years ago. Today, it stands as one of cinema's greatest achievements, a use of the medium that's at once blatantly logical and profoundly affecting.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
There can never be an unimportant chapter in the lives of real human beings. For that reason, the new 63 Up demands watching just as much as any of the previous eight.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
This film and its predecessors are a mirror to all.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
Though no one perspective is universal, 63 Up's remains admirably considered, sweeping, and reflective, which is all just as it should be. It's less an elegy than an ode to life.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
As a whole the 'Up' series is truly an extraordinary cinematic accomplishment...As befits the age of the principals, this installment feels more leisurely and autumnal than earlier ones, but that certainly doesn't make it any less affecting.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
The 7 Up series is uplifting, devastating, profound...and it will leave viewers filled with admiration and awe for these creatures we call human beings.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
With so many backstories to fill in, the movie runs to nearly three hours, yet it's an invaluable portrait of humanity in transition.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
Because of Apted's long relationship with these people, such discussion does not feel exploitative; instead, we glimpse a rare, pure emotional honesty that may not even be shared with friends.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
Kim Horton skillfully weaves together clips from past films - the participants' lives inside a fishbowl literally flashing before our eyes - and both Apted's narration and his gently needling, off-camera interrogations give you all the context you need.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
63 Up moves from brief profiles of one subject to the next, drawing on imagery from their entire lives in chronological order to contrast it with their present selves.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
A fascinating watch and a unique social experiment.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
When I was 27, I arrogantly predicted the series would be over at ""35 Up"" - and I'd be happy to be wrong again.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
Collectively-especially now, with so many of them-the Up series paints a captivating portrait of the arc of a life
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
If you're coming to the series cold, there's enough filmed background to get you up to speed. And if you've become hooked at some point over the years, 63 Up makes for essential viewing.
 "
63 Up,98,93,critic,"
The steadfast subjects-10 men and, still shockingly, only four women-have gone through the usual life changes.

The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,audience,"Great movie.  The actors, script, and of course the directing is amazing, if you read the overview and can't imagine it would be good.  It's better this director rarely has made a bad movie.  Make a point to check it out."
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,audience,"Great acting by Benedict Cumberbatch and the underrated Michael Shannon. Stunning period based visuals as well. Dialogue often felt reminiscent of Aaron Sorkin, though without as strong a plot. Wish we got to see more Tom Holland of course."
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,audience,"What makes for a dull Physics lecture, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon dazzles with spectacular production design and cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung's flashy camera movements in this dramatization of the famed titular rivalry of Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse in the race to light up American cities with electricity that also leads up to the world's first execution by electrocution of William Francis Kemmler."
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,audience,Very interesting story. I was disappointed upon learning that a key plot point was not historically accurate. Overall very entertaining.
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,audience,"Its flaw is quite simply its scope.  Its a 2-hour movie attempting to tell the story of the invention frenzy of the turn of the 19/20th century and its just too much to try to condense even the essence of that historic period into 2 hours.  So what the movie does is show the snippet highlights and while this might work if you're telling a much smaller story it doesn't work with such a huge story. No one who hasn't read the history of the time comes away thinking ""I get it"".  So the best it can do is make audience goers want to read/investigate more about the actual story and that's not going to happen. So from that point its disappointing. Perhaps if they narrowed down the story it would have worked better. Every actor is excellent but that's not enough to make this a great movie, unfortunately."
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,audience,"This movie was excellently filmed, well acted, and a wonderful representation of American ingenuity. Absolutely loved it"
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,audience,It wasn't terrible.  Interesting enough and a nice history lesson but overall very boring.
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,audience,one star goes to Benedict Cumberbatch.
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,audience,"This has to be one of the most inspiring movies I've seen in 2020, great acting from all actors and actresses, really compelling story with fantastic score, highly recommend!!!"
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,audience,"The good editing of this movie intrigues to follow the characters in this biographical story about the men that brought the energy to the US.
If everything in this movie was coherent with the real facts, this is a great way to make the story interesting to watch. Good note for the soundtrack."
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,critic,"
The Current War is instructive and lively, bolstered by the talents of Cumberbatch and Shannon in particular.
 "
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,critic,"
Benedict Cumberbatch as boyish, blustery Edison and Michael Shannon as the reserved, ruminative Westinghouse - provide the juice to make this history lesson shine.

Overall, the movie lacks the voltage necessary to relate this epic tale in the manner it deserves.

It's a dizzying menu, aimed at eliminating any hint of fustiness and show that this is a story as modern as the rivalry between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. And I suppose it is. But it's also absorbing enough not to need any artificial means of support.

This is an interesting, well-filmed historical drama about a technological showdown that produced something we now all take for granted, as Edison predicted we would
 "

Rejon does his best to liven up the material, employing all manner of stylistic flourishes - some delightful, some distracting, but can't overcome a script trying to do too much at once and not achieving much of any of it.
 "
The Current War: Director's Cut,61,79,critic,"
Shamefully, the women in the film don't seem to matter a damn. Neither spouse (played by Tuppence Middleton and Katherine Waterston) is given enough to do. It's ironic and telling that this was one of the last Weinstein Company films.

Jojo Rabbit,80,94,audience,"Some great moments, but the blend of comedy and drama doesn't work for me. It isn't that it's impossible to make a comedy set in Nazi Germany, but some of the plot felt random and I found a few of the performances (Johansson for instance) overrated."
Jojo Rabbit,80,94,audience,"It was brilliantly done. Waititi is genius. It takes real skill to combine one of the most tragic times in history of humankind with comedy without offending anyone. 
All the performances were above par, especially Roman's. That kid will be an Oscar winner should he stay in the business."
Jojo Rabbit,80,94,audience,"JoJo Rabbit is another well-rounded master piece from Taika Waititi. I laughed out loud, and bawled my eyes out intermittently. Which is a lot, because i normally feel nothing.
5/5 would recommend."
Jojo Rabbit,80,94,audience,"Taiki Waititi does a masterful job presenting the horrors of World War II and the Holocaust as seen through the innocent naive eyes of a young boy growing up in Nazi Germany. It will take you on an emotional journey from laughing to crying to feeling good again. JoJo Rabit was my pick for the best movie of 2020 and that is saying something because it had stiff competition; Joker, 1917, Ford vs Ferrari, Parasite (winner) were also worthy in my opinion."
Jojo Rabbit,80,94,audience,The best movie I've seen in ages. Quirky thoughtfulness throughout a film Taika Waititi's brilliance permeates. Roman Griffin Davis is a joy.

Jojo Rabbit,80,94,audience,"There were very few parts that I found funny. I appreciated the interesting cinematography and unique concept, but I found it quite unsettling as the perspective seems to cause confusion about whom to root for, especially because the audience already knows the historical outcome. Also, some of their accents were difficult to understand."
Jojo Rabbit,80,94,audience,"Great movie! Very well written, actors were spot on."
Jojo Rabbit,80,94,audience,"A truly beautiful movie with so much heart, about one of the worst events in the history of humanity. Despite it's comedic tone. throughout majority of the movie, the movie still takes it's subject matter very seriously and doesn't shy away from extreme drama and emotion.
The performances are all incredible with the stand outs being Scarlet Johansson and Roman Griffin Davis.
It's absolutely hilarious, depressing, hopeful and optimistic, dark and somber, and inspiring, It has everything a great story needs."

Parasite,98,90,audience,"THE PERFECT DECEIT


Every now and then a phenomenon appears in the world. The movie world is no exception. I know that the Oscars are one of the most popular events, but let's be honest, everyone who is even a bit interested in the beauty of cinema knows well that the Cannes festival really awards world-class works. For example, last year's winner of the festival ""Parasite"". After watching the movie myself I understood why. Bong Joon-ho is distinguished by extraordinary originality in his movies. ""Snowpiercer"" or ‘Okja' are pure evidence that this director never repeats himself. He will always surprise us with a new story, completely different from the others, with something astounding about it. His new work ""Parasite"" also belongs to this canon, but this time Bong Joon-Ho presents us with a story that surpasses all previous sensational achievements of the Korean. 

This should be a review, not a spoiler, so I will try to describe the plot of this masterpiece as simple as possible. Let's start with the fact that the main characters are a poor Korean family (parents and two young adult children) living in a musty basement. The movie starts with a great misfortune, the wi-fi password was changed in a local area and the family loses access to the Internet. At some point we can all relate to this little ‘catastrophe'. Sooner or later thanks to a friend's recommendation the family's son, finds a job as an English tutor to a teenage girl from a wealthy family. He quickly starts implementing a plan that will allow him to get his sister and parents to work for the rich. At this point, it felt like the entire movie was supposed to be a comedy of contrasting poor and rich families, and seeing the poor struggling to stay afloat. But don't worry the movie is about more than that.

Most of the things that happen as the story unfolds are unpredictable. The unconventional creator doesn't give everything up on the plate right away. Parasite starts off as a comedy, we have a lot of black humor here, incredible plot twists, the scenes are erratic and the tension keeps growing. It is impossible to guess what's going to happen at the very end or even in the next few moments. And on top of all this, Bong Joon-Ho shows us one of the biggest issues of the world: the differences between rich and poor. 

Not only the script and direction in Parasite is excellent. The whole thing looks great in every possible way. The shots and music are a real feast for the senses, and the way the camera is operated makes us get to know the Park house like our own pocket. In addition, we also get a small look on a poor Korean town, which in my opinion may interest the European viewer. Also the cast of this movie did a stunning job. 

Parasite is told in a modern, poetic, light and daring way. This piece of art devours the spectator, does not cause any problems with assimilation, and at the same time is an absolutely refined work at the highest level. In my opinion everyone should watch this movie. It hides a lot of variety that you will not notice at first glance. It has an intriguing story, combines humor with seriousness and the both family's cannot be seen as good or bad. ""Parasite"" is an extremely courageous movie that touches on social stratification, and it does it in a daring manner it amuses and moves. Bong again provided great entertainment for us."

Parasite,98,90,audience,"Easy to captivate an audience with just the script and directing, when the movie is shot on the Arri Alexa 65 with Arri DNA lenses.

Parasite,98,90,audience,"Parasita é fantástico. É inteligente. É engraçado. É perturbador. E sim, há um poderoso tema subjacente à divisão entre ricos e pobres.

Everyone can do everything for their life even though they know that it is not right. The villain is not Park's family but it is the unfair society. It is the system that always helps and support the rich people and this system makes to the poor can't rise. Every scene is like a art, the audience can feel how they separate the class of the rich and the poor in one frame. And the soundtrack is very minimal but it is very emotional."

The Goldfinch,24,72,audience,"I found it immensely engaging, and an easy watch.  I cant quite say why in retrospect, the characters were hollow, the story was fragmented.  Somehow this largely incoherent movie, managed to be both moving and uplifting and yet completely flat and disingenuous at the same time.  An interesting watch if for nothing more than the strange experience of having watched it."
The Goldfinch,24,72,audience,"This movie just so-so I was debating between a 6 or a 7. It's a good story, but there is something missing. At a little over 2 1/2 hours it should have been able to tell the story better. Also there was a lot of jumping back and forth in time which didn't help matters. The pacing was decent, but I think better editing would have helped. Nicole Kidman was excellent and so was Ansel, but Luke and Sarah's roles almost could have been eliminated. I don't think it is movie I would watch again."
The Goldfinch,24,72,audience,It's like a movie trailer that drags on for 2.5 hours. No depth. Cliche after cliche.
The Goldfinch,24,72,audience,"Nonostante sia un vero piacere per gli occhi grazie all'ottima regia tecnica, questo banale tentativo di adattamento cinematografico al romanzo Il Cardellino è un totale disastro. Il film è molto lungo, ma per poter condensare in modo appropriato tutte le importanti nozioni raccontate nel libro erano necessarie, circa, dieci ore di più. Ovviamente non era possibile e si è scelto di tagliare brutalmente tutto ciò che rende il libro un piccolo capolavoro, presentando allo spettatore solo le scene chiave in un ordine (tra l'altro) totalmente storpiato. Il risultato è una sorta di mini trailer del romanzo che non riesce in nessun modo ad esprimere i concetti d'arte e di bellezza, a emozionare con i fantastici pensieri del protagonista o a scalfire minimamente la superficie dell'oceano di informazioni presenti nell'opera letteraria. E' un po' come provare a mangiare una minestra con la forchetta, non si riuscirà mai ad assaporare il vero gusto corposo della zuppa."
The Goldfinch,24,72,audience,"This was undoubtedly one of the dreariest, most ill-conceived, piles of pretentious twaddle I've seen in a long time. I would rank it alongside Brad Pitt's Tree of Life and the interminable Tinker, Tailor adaptation as suitable only for self-flagellating punishment or a test of your ninja meditation skills."
The Goldfinch,24,72,audience,"I did not like the book at all, but caught the movie on a flight and it was really good..."
The Goldfinch,24,72,audience,"This movie was a lot better then I expected. Now sure why the critics didn’t like it. Thought how the film was shot and the story was pretty good. The only downside is the last bit, ending felt a bit lazy and rushed. But aside from that overall great film. "
The Goldfinch,24,72,audience,"Personally, I thought the film was entertaining, moving, and beautifully shot. I guess the critics and viewers who felt the need to bash The Goldfinch need to stick to instant gratification and Michael Bay films."

Un necesariamente fragmentado drama de personajes con aliento novelístico

En una habitación de hotel el joven Theodor (Ansel Elgort) pasa revista a parte de su vida a partir del momento traumático en que con 13 años sobrevive a  un atentado en el Metropolitan Museum de Nueva York en el que pierde a su madre.

Basada en una novela de Donna Tartt, y por ser bastante bastante fiel a ella, la película de John Crowley quizás resulte demasiado ambiciosa y algo dispersa. Esto puede ser, en parte,  por su estructura temporal,  que alterna entre el Theo adulto  y sucesos de cuando contaba 13 años (a cargo de Oakes Fegley), por el carácter trunco de ciertos episodios, por la variedad de tópicos tratados  y por cierta desconexión entre ellos. Pero este carácter fragmentario resulta coherente con la situación que vive el protagonista en el hotel y por el carácter de los sucesos en una vida para nada lineal y con bastante mala suerte. De golpe, Theo, a los 13 años, debe elegir y tomar decisiones a un edad en que es fácil equivocarse y en que son los adultos los que en definitiva deciden. Elecciones y decisiones que tienen que ver con quiénes se desea y elige estar, el valor de los objetos, el mundo del arte, el cuidado de sí mismo y la búsqueda de contención.

Con algún momento de acción, la película sale adelante sin embargo porque es un drama de personajes bien construidos y por las interpretaciones, comenzando por las notables actuaciones de Fegley y Elgort, con quienes es imposible no empatizar. Los acompaña un gran elenco, comenzando por la infalible Nicole Kidman (componiendo otra de las interesantes madres que ya le ha dado al cine) y siguiendo con Jeffrey Wright, Luke Wilson, una Sarah Paulson más  sexy que nunca y un avasallante Finn Wolfhart  como su amigo en la adolescencia.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A necessarily fragmentary character drama with a novelistic breath

In a hotel room, the young Theodor (Ansel Elgort) reviews part of his life from the traumatic moment when, at the age of 13, he survives an attack at the Metropolitan Museum in New York in which he loses his mother.

Based on a novel by Donna Tartt, and being quite faithful to it, John Crowley's film may be too ambitious and somewhat scattered. This may be, in part, due to its temporal structure, which alternates between the adult Theo and events from when he was 13 years old (by Oakes Fegley), due to the truncated nature of certain episodes, due to the variety of topics covered and due to certain disconnection between them. But this fragmentary character is consistent with the situation that the protagonist lives in the hotel and because of the nature of the events in a life that is not linear at all and with quite bad luck. Suddenly, Theo, at age 13, must choose and make decisions at an age when it is easy to make mistakes and when it is the adults who ultimately decide. Choices and decisions that have to do with who you want and choose to be, the value of objects, the world of art, taking care of yourself and the search for containment.

With some moment of action, the film goes ahead however because it is a drama of well-constructed characters, for its novelistic breath and for the interpretations, starting with the remarkable performances of Fegley and Elgort, with whom it is impossible not to empathize. They are accompanied by a great cast, starting with the infallible Nicole Kidman (composing another of the interesting mothers that he has already given to the cinema) and continuing with Jeffrey Whright, Luke Wilson, a Sarah Paulson sexier than ever and an overwhelming Finn Wolfhart as his friend in adolescence."
The Goldfinch,24,72,audience,"I normally don't write reviews like this but seeing the ratings of this movie absolutely broke my heart. I might not know a lot about literature nor am an expert on films but I've never been touched more by a story than when I read the Goldfinch. I will admit the main reason why it is so beautiful is because it is based on a masterpiece, so I definitely recommend reading the book first. That aside, I loved how the actors brought my favourite characters to life. I loved the small details from the original story that they used. I loved the way the things they said almost sounded like poetry and I loved how I found myself so easily relating to these characters without really wanting to. I highly recommend others to read the book or watch the movie because it would be a shame to let this incredible story go to waste because of negative responses."

While perhaps not the surefire Oscar bet that might be expected of an adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize winner, The Goldfinch is nevertheless an enthralling story filled with fascinating characters and great performances.

This is one of the many muddy and unhelpful responses to the events of 9/11 and what has come after them, along with other events in the new century.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
The rough-edged-yet-tender friendship between Theo and Boris feels lived-in, yet somehow, when it resurfaces in adult form, it feels as phony and superficial as if the characters were being introduced for the first time.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
The expansive story takes one or two strange turns too many and feels stretched in its final half-hour but is bolstered by tremendous performances courtesy of the ensemble, with Fegley, Kidman, Jeffrey Wright and Luke Wilson leading the pack.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
In what could possibly be the most ambitious adaptation of the year - if not of the century - The Goldfinch swings for the stars and lands with the birds in a supremely sentimental, highly cinematic and oftentimes unbearably manicured film.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
Crowley's film isn't awful, necessarily, but there's a narrative anaemia that leaves the whole thing feeling flat.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
The approach is so lackluster, with such little energy within the scenes, that it was a struggle to keep engaged with what was happening.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
Thank the casting gods for seeing that this overlong and confusingly plotted film has at its core a heartbreaking performance from an imp slightly under five-foot-tall, Oakes Fegley.

The Goldfinch felt messy, poorly paced, and indicative of having been based on a book that I fear may also bore me now that the film has spoiled the bulk of its plot developments.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
A cinematic jigsaw puzzle with too many pieces missing. Easy on the eyes, hard on the brain.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
The Goldfinch feels rushed yet lacking in energy, more a transplantation of the book's plot than an invested adaptation.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
The thrilling crime drama that grips the book's final third flits by in about five minutes, as the director perhaps realized that we were already at the two-and-half hour mark.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
This adaptation of Donna Tarrt's novel has an interesting -- if not always plausible -- story, but there must have been a more efficient way to tell it. Large stretches, especially the coming-of-age Nevada chapters, are leaden longueurs.
 "
The Goldfinch,24,72,critic,"
Though The Goldfinch may have a solid enough cast and impressive visuals, they are not enough to boost up a film weighed down by its lack of emotion, episodic story and overlong runtime

If you are one of the many people who read the novel by Donna Tartt, however, this maligned, handsome film is more than worth watching.

A dull, dreary picture that never seems sure where it's going but takes two-and-a-half hours to get there anyway.
 "

As pretty as the film looks, it's also static, stifled by its own portent, a butterfly mounted on a corkboard with wings spread.

Within the odd missteps, I find myself moved by the full-mouth, open-hearted yearning for hope and forgiveness that The Goldfinch espouses.

A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,95,92,audience,"Tom Hanks does a fantastic job fantastic job in his portrayal of Fred Rogers and I'm sure this will garner him an Oscar nomination (which I believe would be rightly deserved). I didn't see WON'T YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR from last year but after watching this film, I have more of a desire (especially to compare how closely Hanks' performance was to the real Mr. Rogers). The film plays as an episode of the show, which I found to be an enjoyable take, although at times it almost seems the movie is about journalist Tom Junod as opposed to Mr. Rogers. Other than that, this is typical Oscar bait that may garner more nominations other than Hanks. Overall, it was a pleasant movie but once in which I'm sure many people won't have a long memory for in just a few months time."
A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,95,92,audience,"This movie was slow, but a sweet story. The cinematography was creative. Acting was obviously amazing. The music was loud/distracting at times, especially in contrast to the stark silence at other times. There was also a high pitched ""ringing-in-your-ears"" sound at uncomfortable moments, which I found very annoying."
A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,95,92,audience,"I'm going against the grain but I thought this was rather average. On a positive note, there are touching moments and it has an endearing message of love, compassion and understanding which is particularly relevant to our time. However, this is not a Fred Rogers biopic. It's a story of a reporter and his dysfunctional relationship with his father. The script is emotionally intelligent but slow and the long pauses between dialogue and overly soft tone make scenes feel like they go on forever. I also found the cynic-turned-believer arc of the main character rather cliched and predictable. Overall average, but I would recommend for the positive message and themes."
A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,95,92,audience,"One of the best-written movies I've seen in years.  Hollywood could have really screwed this up, but they did not.  It's a must-see!"

It's a simply lovely story about the importance of optimism, the power of niceness and the virtue of knowing how to control and channel emotions into something useful.

What are we to do with...a film with not a mean millisecond in its length; a film that celebrates kindness, forgiveness, compassion, faith, and innocence with reckless abandon? Here's what you do: You embrace it.
 "
A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,95,92,critic,"
A film that positions Tom Hanks for Best Supporting Actor because he's surprisingly not the main character. If you know that going in, you'll love the movie. Just don't expect it to be Fred Rogers' life story in a traditional biopic.

"Where'd You Go, Bernadette",49,74,audience,"FUNNY MOVIE with a witty slant on a certain upscale, tech-enriched segment of today's Seattle (I've lived in Seattle a long time).  Best part is Cate Blanchett's clever take on the quirky genius and maddening vulnerability of Bernadette Fox.  I'm guessing that women like me (a bit older but forever young at heart) are the biggest fans of this movie, but tender guys and families with teenage girls should find plenty to like here, too.  Plus, if you'd love a virtual journey to Antarctica and much good humor along the way, ""Where'd you go, Bernadette"" is well worth the time you'll spend watching.  OVERALL MOVIE QUALITY=3.5 stars; but make that 4 stars if you stream it as a Saturday afternoon matinee with buttered popcorn."
"Where'd You Go, Bernadette",49,74,audience,"I haven't disliked Cate Blanchett in a role this much since her Russian Indiana Jones nonsense.   I gave it a full star as apposed to a half as I watched it for an additional 15 minutes before I turned it off..as there was a slight glimmer of hope..

Oof."
"Where'd You Go, Bernadette",49,74,audience,Cate Blanchett is wonderful but she probably could have played the dog Ice-Cream and been worth watching. The rest of the movie was like some sort of happy Disney movie.
"Where'd You Go, Bernadette",49,74,audience,"This film fizzled at the end but one aspect of the narrative that I appreciated was the daughter's unconditional love and staunch defense of her mother. Most films depicting a family in crisis has the children, and especially daughters, at screaming odds with the maternal figure."

Blanchett and Nelson in particular have some excellent scenes together, natural chemistry between two women. If you like movies about misfits trapped in a conformist tribe, this film revels in its main character's ornery uncooperativeness."

"Where'd You Go, Bernadette",49,74,audience,"What did I think of the movie? this film has a great performance by Cate Blanchett

"Where'd You Go, Bernadette",49,74,critic,"
It's easy to see why Cate Blanchett was drawn to such a project - especially with Richard Linklater... But his film adaptation of Maria Semple's satirical novel about motherhood and ambition is uncharacteristically ham-fisted.

Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice,89,99,audience,"If you love good music and one of the best voices of all time, you should know about Linda Ronstadt."
Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice,89,99,audience,Fabulous documentary about one of the absolute greatest ever.
Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice,89,99,audience,"JUST ONE LOOK

You want the dirt? There ain't none. Documentaries without bite kinda bite, but can serve as well placed bookmarks for times long forgotten. Some say for the best. Yet there's enough in this here Linda Ronstadt biopic to achieve a wee bit of melancholic flashback entertainment.

Chiefly forgotten these days, Linda Ronstadt was a money making dynamo in the seventies, cranking out platinum albums, crossing over genres like there were no walls, dominating the AM radio charts, and gracing magazine covers with her squeaky clean cutie pie all American girl next door looks (sometimes in a Girl Scout uniform). Cool that next door is actually Mexico (which flows in her river of blood), and proved to be the inspiration for the fabulous ""Conciones de mi Padre"" record, easily the musical highlight of her varied career.

Ronstadt turns out to be quite the smart lady, delivering a confident maturity and political savvy belying her fresh years in an early clip. Her climb to fame, which at the time looked meteoric, was actually a struggle, yet seems all but inevitable because of her awesome pipes. It is great to see the power, command and drive in her live performances, since most of her albums are now garage sale filler. Ronstadt was a force of the times, but because she wasn't a composer, gets little historic play in the cruel entertainment biz.

As is par for a music doc course, the formative early years are the draw, and Ronstadt's are surprisingly kaleidoscopic. Her quirky family, which includes heralded inventor, great grandpa Ronstadt (the electric toaster!) deserves more air time, but the heady, just post-woodstock adventures with the Eagles, Emmylou Harris and Neil Young, is what rock loving boomers crave, and get.

A juicy tabloid romance with much maligned Governor Jerry Brown is hardly mentioned, which begs the question is there more than this squeaky clean wikipedia style document offers? Perhaps not. There may not be any dirt, but surely they could have dug a bit deeper.

Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice,89,99,audience,"Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice is a unique documentary that focuses on an American singer who tackled music genres from Country to Mexican folk. I love the people who are interviewed, the concert footages, the pacing and the storytelling. Before this documentary, I barley know who Linda is because she made music with Dolly Parton. After seeing this documentary, I now enjoy her music. Overall, Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice is a pure and unique music documentary."
Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice,89,99,audience,I bawled throughout this entire movie. There's something about Linda Ronstadt that cuts right into my soul and stays there
Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice,89,99,audience,"In general hubby and wife are not fans of these puff music documentaries, and while hubby could take or leave 'Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of my Voice', wife rather enjoyed it.  Hubby:  It's a nostalgic trip down memory lane and undoubtedly there's some really good music, but there's nothing of substance.  It's surface and feels like an E True Hollywood story with only positivity.  The doc almost entirely glosses over the last 15-20 years of her life with little explanation.  Once we find out why she's disappeared from public life, I wanted to know a lot more about her thoughts and feelings and we just don't get that.  Also the current Ronstadt is used as a narrator, but she's barely on camera.  Do yourself a favor and go listen to some of her music and read her Wikipedia page and you get about the same content.  The doc also branches off to explain how Ronstadt brought other artists together which is welcome, but it spends too much time going off subject which makes the titular individual seem less relevant than necessary.  Wife:  I didn't mind the reminiscing, however it was just a musical review of a wonderful career.  Nothing profound, but nothing lost.  Wife: 7.6/Hubby: 6.4 Average Final Score: 7.0/10"

It's heart-clutching and makes one understand what Ronstadt's Penzance co-star, Kevin Kline, says earlier in the film about her voice: ""Celestial yet earthy. So absolutely pure. It made me cry.""
 "
Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice,89,99,critic,"
You don't reach the level of stardom Ronstadt did without a white-hot fire of blind ambition, and although the film paints a portrait of an artist hell-bent on success, it's also clear she was also forever doubtful of her own abilities.
 "
Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice,89,99,critic,"
Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice is essential viewing for any of her fans, and it's worth seeing for anyone who appreciates knowing more about a very talented and unique singer.
 "
Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice,89,99,critic,"
The film successfully paints Ronstadt as a whip-smart, boundary-breaking artist... But it shys away from critically evaluating her accomplishments while portraying her as somewhat forgotten in today's music scene, which seems a tad unfair.

Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am,97,96,audience,"Refreshingly honest, 'Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am' is a first person account of the beloved author and it's pretty great.  Intermingled with lots of photos from decades ago, and interviews with friends, colleagues, and admirers, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders weaves together a wonderfully positive documentary.  The two hour runtime flies by as the words of Morrison are bathed upon you like glitter.  I have not had the pleasure of reading a Morrison book, but i will now. Perhaps this is one giant commercial, but it's quite effective.  When the dustbin of history is uncovered centuries from now, it's pretty clear Morrison will go down as one of the most revered American authors.   To be clear, there isn't any negativity here.  If Morrison did have any flaws they're not shown.  The movie is primarily talking heads, and one of them is Oprah Winfrey.  That's a pretty big get.  Definitely worth watching with a cup of tea.  Final Score: 8.6/10"
Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am,97,96,audience,"Wonderful look at Toni Morrison & her story—loved this powerful line about how racist or supremacist ways of thinking & being damage white folks as well: “If you can only be tall if someone’s on their knees, then there’s something wrong with you.”"

Timothy Greenfield-Sanders's documentary portrait of the Nobel-winning author is a fluent introduction to her work, but its main attraction is the sense it gives you of being in her company.

Instead it capitalises on the authority with which she talks about her craft and the life experience and history that has informed it to provide an illuminating personal insight into her radical body of work.

Whether you have read everything she wrote or have never ventured into her worlds, it's likely that the first thing you'll do when you leave the cinema is pick up one of her novels.

Greenfield-Sanders's film is not as structurally daring as its subject, but it makes great use of archive and text alongside its talking heads.
 "
Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am,97,96,critic,"
Timothy Greenfield-Sanders' timely documentary on the Nobel Prize-winning novelist is a persuasive argument for rereading Morrison if you've already read her works -- and if you haven't, an imperative to get to it.
 "
Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am,97,96,critic,"
The revelation that Morrison was also a single mother of two, who would get up daily at 4am to write before going to her high-powered job at a New York publishing house, is equally inspiring and exhausting.
 "
Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am,97,96,critic,"
This documentary is a potent commercial for the books themselves.

For all the intellectual content, the most rewarding part of this documentary is the presence of Morrison herself - her infectious laugh, her famous carrot cake, her joyful love of parties.
 "
Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am,97,96,critic,"
Coming less than a year after her death, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders' film can't help being an elegy - but a celebration, too, of a woman acutely of her times and always a step ahead of them.
 "
Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am,97,96,critic,"
It's incisive, it's precise, and it's honest
 "

A celebratory portrait of author Toni Morrison painted by those who knew her, this compelling documentary also explores how her work gives such a powerful voice to the African American experience.

[A] fitting tribute to a national treasure.
 "

David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,audience,"This is Rock History! What a unique individual that 
LIVES & LOVES...
Change Rock with his message... 
""CSN MESSAGE WILL LIVE ON FOREVER"" in our HEARTS..
Love U David Crosby🙌🏽"
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,audience,"I very much enjoyed this.  Here's a great documentary that tells the story of another life super well lived.  I get the sense from the life that David Crosby has lived that I am not living my own life even half to its fullest.  I'm enchanted with the era that he lived through, including where he was when he was surrounded by all the fun going on around him in his younger life.  It makes me wonder why my life seems so boring in comparison.  The music made by CSN and CSNY was so amazing.  The magic and heart and soul is so discernible in the sound of it all.  I would certainly watch this again some day.  That Crosby still lives after all he's been through means that he is a biological miracle."
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,audience,"This film was a powerful, spiritual and life reckoning journey for a man who help set the tone for a generation. I strongly encourage my peers to see this movie."
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,audience,"One of the more honest and genuine autobiographical documentaries of recent memory, 'David Crosby, Remember My Name', is a worthwhile venture for fans of the musician.  Not without flaws from a first-time filmmaker, the best thing is that Crosby just talks.  Contrite on certain issues, defiant on others, but brutally honest Crosby is polarizing and his spirit is infectious.  There's a lot missing, perhaps due to the drugs Crosby has done over the years, but the truths and the introspection is reason enough to watch.  It's not easy, but it goes to show ya if you just stay out of the way as a writer and producer of a doc you can make a good film.  One major problem is the lazy way the film is made by having Crosby voiceover (clearly reading) certain aspects of his life.  It's especially distracting when the voiceover occurs directly after Crosby is being interviewed.  I hope there's more than this 90 minutes on Crosby.  He's fascinating and his wisdom and ideas should be out there.  Final Score:  7.2/10"
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,audience,"This biopic changed my mind about David Crosby....I now see him less as the pontific narcissist he comes off being in his autobiographies, and more as an eccentric visionary whose gift was to bring the right people into a room and make magic. The story about the making of the song, Ohio, is illuminating. It digs down to reveal the role an artist can play that is driven by genius, madness, and yes, narcissism. But to discover a man in the dark winter of life expressing such contrition....it really throws the ball back into SNY's court. There is no time! Crosby knows there is a vacuum in our music world, and like Carl Bernstein, he wants back in. He wants to take CSNY back out for one last sweet spin. We need a new ""Ohio."" Otherwise.....Well laid out documentary by master film maker, Cameron Crowe, you are in for a treat with a journey through the Laurel Canyon past. It's a hell of a ride!"
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,audience,"This documentary not only captures a time, place, and era - but Crosby himself warts and all. A captivating, frank discussion with a music legend who is owning his behavior and rightly proud of his art. Totally engaging, interesting, heartfelt, and informative. A wonderful snapshot of not only the sex, drugs and rock and roll - but a tutorial road tour by one of rocks greatest artists.  Crosby reflects and pulls the curtain back on himself and the group dynamics of the music industry and his peers. They in turn, weigh in too.  It ain't pretty - but it's pretty fascinating.  Crosby is terrifically glib, reflective, intelligent and engaging.  He's still on the road. Still writing & performing wonderful music -  and this is must see for all music fans of that era."
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,audience,"Such a story of innocence, beauty and reality - all within a dream. The ending is profound ♥️"
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,audience,"Poignantly presented and an amazingly candid portrait of a gifted artist coming to terms with his own mortality and taking stock of his failures as well as success. His music is timeless and I saw him in concert the night before the movie. See it even if you are too young to know the music. He has lessons to teach, cautions to heed."
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,audience,"Having grown up in that time that CSB & Y  were becoming famous I enjoy the documentary very much.  Having always felt that David was the bad boy reported in news stories in later years,  the film gets a first hand account from the artist.  AJ Eaton made the edits  all blend together.  Quality of the cinematography, use of the archive footage and animation made a memorable story that keeps you wanting to hear more. We had the pleasure of listening to AJ Eaton in Sun Valley on Labor Day weekend.  There were many more stories that got left on the cutting room floor but look  forward to the Blue Ray coming out. "

What David Crosby: Remember My Name feels like is an elegy. Crosby understands the end is near and that he is bound to leave behind unrepaired relationships and financial messiness. He's trying to fix it, but there's just not enough time.

There's some kind of lesson there: Be full enough of spit and vinegar, and you might just survive your biggest mistakes.

This come-clean doc has Crosby telling a lot of solid rock tales all in the name of truth. Whether you believe him or not, though, the man really does make good music, even now at 78.

The film has a solid first hour, then loses focus and sort of drifts off in its final 30 minutes. Still, there is much to admire here, for this is no warm dip into fuzzy nostalgia.

David Crosby: Remember My Name records a life as rich as the music Crosby recorded. It's well worth remembering.

Strangely, while you may not regard Crosby as a decent person, you respect his candor and are touched by his vulnerability as he opens up to filmmaker Cameron Crowe, who produced the movie.
 "
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,critic,"
Crosby is making amends the only way he knows how, really... To his credit, that wonderful voice has remained pure and strong, and he's using it to get out all he has to say, as quickly as he can.
 "
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,critic,"
The secret sauce here is Crosby himself, who is at turns cantankerous and charismatic, surly and sentimental -- but always willing to answer even the most personal questions.
 "
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,critic,"
After all this time and all of his proclivities he is alive and kicking. That alone makes this film worth watching.

Even without this film, Crosby's the kind of figure who would have always been remembered, but director Eaton has delivered a fascinating document worthy of such a remarkable life.
 "
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,critic,"
Here is a musician that shows no signs of slowing down, remaining as fascinating as he has ever been. ""Remember My Name"" serves as the perfect showcase for that talent.
 "
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,critic,"
Throughout, Crosby is true to himself, even if that means coming to terms with being insufferable. Remember My Name is a portrait of an artist in reflection, and it's a hard, sobering look in the mirror.
 "
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,critic,"
As a portrait of a flawed and regretful human being, even one who has seen great successes along the way, [A.J.] Eaton's film does have a valuable sobering quality that feels more universal.
 "
David Crosby: Remember My Name,93,87,critic,"
Most importantly, the film is not an exercise in hero worshiping. Crosby's warts are visible for all to see.

Maiden,98,97,audience,This is one of the most uplifting movies I have ever seen.
Maiden,98,97,audience,"If there was to be only one movie to answer a question of an alien fife form wondering ""what the hell humans are all about?"" - that would be it! A wonderfully crafted, true, inspirational and emotional story that makes me proud of being a human being. A masterpiece!"
Maiden,98,97,audience,"A movie to enjoy even if you are not into sailing.  It is a bit like Apollo 13: you already know the ending, but it still feels like a surprise.  A really feel good movie that shows that you can win without winning."
Maiden,98,97,audience,"Excellent telling and filming of the entire story, especially the struggle for financing and Bob Fisher's (sports journalist for The Guardian) coverage."
Maiden,98,97,audience,"Solid watch. Strange to be transported back to the times where women were viewed as laughable tarts for attempting manly task they might be better suited towards. If there is one complaint I think they sanitised the sexism of the time. Much worse occurred and not many thought anything of it. A sign of the times piece of work, showing women sticking it to the man. The only disappointment was those swimsuits into New York...but, sign of the times. The best line was Ms. Edwards expressing the disbelief of what, ""That little horror grew up to achieve"". Good stuff."
Maiden,98,97,audience,An extraordinary achievement and uplifting story.
Maiden,98,97,audience,"'Maiden', is a documentary film about Tracy Edwards and the crew of the Maiden as they compete as the first all-woman crew in the 1989–1990 Whitbread Round the World Race.  It's lovely and packs a punch and should be made into a dramatic feature film.  These are strong incredible women who defied odds just to compete.  It's just a remarkable story.  As for the doc, it's fine.  Tons of unearthed footage and standard talking heads.  We surely could have dove deeper into how the funding came so suddenly, but that isn't the overlying theme.  Show this to a teenage girl when they're down in the dumps!  Uplifting!  Final Score: 8.2/10"
Maiden,98,97,audience,Authentic and Perfect in every way! A must see..
Maiden,98,97,audience,Well done documentary using footage of the actual event. As someone with a little experience sailing small boats on lakes and bays I was awed by the power of the Southern Oceans and the courage of the young female crew.

Luckily, this isn't the type of film that coasts on its inherently interesting story. It's edited with gusto, lining up its talking heads to emulate conversations.

Without revealing too much, it's fair to say Maiden, Edwards and her crew did better than most people expected.

Maiden is simply riveting, a story of grandeur and sweep that's also moving and intimate because there are so many naked emotions in play.

Late Night,79,77,audience,"Nicely done. It's a genuine look at a worn out television staple - the late night talk show. This movie is well cast, written and a blessing during the extended lock down we all share. Grab some popcorn and get ready  to smile."
Late Night,79,77,audience,"Although it is at times overbearing in the execution of its themes, and the plot isn't entirely original, Late Night still greatly benefits from a timely (and often hilarious) examination of diversity, representation, and misogyny in the late night television business, as well as an immeasurably enjoyable and committed performance from star Emma Thompson."
Late Night,79,77,audience,"Despite a strong performance by Emma Thompson, the movie fails to deliver any meaningful message in an original, or even entertaining, way. 
Relying on tacky oversimplification while trying to deliver meaningful observations in an attempt to balance light drama with social insight, the movie lands on mediocre, accomplishing neither very well."
Late Night,79,77,audience,"It was alright, but did not do much for me"
Late Night,79,77,audience,"Boring, predictable and lacking originality, Late Night show won't show you anything you haven't seen before about power abuse and maltreating employees. It hasn't any funny moments and the plot is so vulgar that you will be always guessing with success what happens next."
Late Night,79,77,audience,"Badly directed by Nisha Ganatra and terrible script. Very average acting performance by all the 'B-listers', including Mindy Kailing. The plot was all over the place with nothing for the viewer to really catch on to. 1 out of 5"
Late Night,79,77,audience,"Proof that an excellent cast can't compensate for poor writing. Billed as a 'comedy' that is sparse on the lols and heavy on preachy social justice themes. It is hard to wring laughs out of a format like this, but in the hands of a more nuanced or skilled writing team this could have been passable. This film is targeted at a specific demographic, of which I am unlikely to be a part. For its target audience, this will deliver the desired comfort-viewing and provide affirmation for underlying beliefs."
Late Night,79,77,audience,"Late Night is unlikable in the worst possible way. While some comedy movies' strengths come from cynicism and mean-spirited humor, Late Night tries too hard in being satisfying rather than being engaging or enjoyable."
Late Night,79,77,audience,Exceeded all expectations.

Late Night had the potential to break out with some pointed commentary about how women are treated in the entertainment industry, but it falls short at almost every turn.

A showcase for Thompson's ability to elevate any movie she appears in.
 "
Late Night,79,77,critic,"
Not shying away from stereotypes and calling others out for following the status quo, it's a film that is hilarious from start to finish, allowing not only Kaling to shine, but Thompson as well.

It has a lot to say about the positioning of famous women, and women of colour, in today's world.
 "

Tackling ageism, sexism, privilege and racism, Kaling's script doesn't quite have the snappy one-liner ratio or political nous required for a movie set in this industry, but Thompson is as magnetic as ever and their chemistry together sparkle

Where Late Night goes off the rails is in its last third, which feels entirely disconnected from what precedes it.

Late Night is the kind of wish fulfillment comedy that makes for a pleasant viewing experience with relatively low stakes and a charming cast.

The Tomorrow Man,41,44,audience,"The Tomorrow Man is a fresh approach to the struggles and challenges of aging. The man here is afraid of the present and gets ready for a future he may not have, and the woman he loves lives in the present but is surronded by the chaos she creates. They both need each other because they complete each other. It's a well acted film that encopasses the world of old age, as some of us get orderly without enjoying the present, and some of us live in the present forgetting that a minimum of precautions should be taken ""just in case."" But the fact that Hollywood put the main light on the old rather than the young actors pressured by the look rather than by the soul; that fact I found encouraging and a step toward a more mature cinema. I hope Hollywood will keep at is and show what old actors can give."
The Tomorrow Man,41,44,audience,"This is such a great movie and it's very relevant to what's going on in the world right now. I doubt that Blythe Danner or John Lithgow realized how powerful this movie was going to be but I'm so glad I found it, because I'd never heard of it before. It's a movie that needs to be seen by more people"
The Tomorrow Man,41,44,audience,"Lithgow and Danner have chemistry, and its whimsical, eccentric story is the kind that will look extremely appealing in trailers. However, in truth, the story seems of no consequence and you finish the movie wondering what even happened."
The Tomorrow Man,41,44,audience,"John Lithgow and Blythe Danner are an old couple, one's a doomsday prepper and the other a hoarder. It's a cute little romantic drama with some slight comedic elements. Nothing too flashy here, it's a simple premise really. Did not expect that ending to happen though, that's the only thing that kinda caught me by surprise."
The Tomorrow Man,41,44,audience,"Cast was good and great chemistry between Lithgow and Danner. However, the plot was simply full of gaps that did not necessary connect with each other. The story would be better if there were more emphasis on Ed's relationship with family. Sloppy script that does not allow a message to be clearly conveyed."
The Tomorrow Man,41,44,audience,"This was a slow paced movie but it has its moments.  It is a love story about two senior citizens, both with their own unique quirks.  I can tell you, I was definitely surprised by the ending."
The Tomorrow Man,41,44,audience,Nice to see these actors again just wish it was in a better movie.
The Tomorrow Man,41,44,audience,"I liked this move, a cut love story between older adults.  I personally know a ""prepper"" and a ""hoarder"", and the portraits of both were spot on.  Very interesting to watch how they interact and react to each others' quirks."
The Tomorrow Man,41,44,audience,"Lithgow and Danner are usually outstanding, but with this messy romantic relationship of conspiracy theorists it misses the mark of being equally interesting or even sweet to follow these two. "
The Tomorrow Man,41,44,audience,"DEATH DEFYING

Sap alert: yes this is a geriatric romance of the old fashioned variety, but it has enough little detours to make it work. The exceptional acting from John Lithgow and Blythe Danner doesn't hurt.

As an aging, secretive survivalist know it all, Ed spends most of his time on conspiracy internet boards, that is until he spies Ronnie at the local grocery store. Courting ensues, with all the magic and hurdles that come with any relationship.

Turns out there's more than one secret to be revealed which threatens a future for these lonely souls, and though the plot line is paint by numbers, there's a sweet innocence that saves this film. A bit of an unexpected ending helps wrap the whole thing up with a lovely bow.

The ingredients for something unique and special are evident, but ultimately the characters' colorful (and wildly different) personality traits seem more important than what happens when you put them in close proximity.

The Chaperone,47,75,audience,"Elizabeth McGovern is such a sensitive actor, always a pleasure to watch, and the script gives her enough to work with, though it could be a good deal better.  Haley Richardson is fine in the role of Louise Brooks but I really didn't get Geza Rohrig in this, first of all he's supposed to be German and he clearly is Eastern European do the filmmakers have so little respect for the audience that they don't think we can tell the difference? His lines seem to be muffled as well.  He's a good actor, but seems miscast here.  A passing TV drama, an interesting idea and McGovern lifts it, but overall disappointing."
The Chaperone,47,75,audience,"I very much enjoyed this film and I'm not usually a fan of films set in this time period. The actress who portrays Norma was captivating to me, she kept me watching, made me laugh and cry."
The Chaperone,47,75,audience,"Louise Brooks was one of the epic Hollywood crash and burn stories -- one grim enough that her biography should probably be required reading as a cautionary tale for all young actresses venturing into harm's way. The saga of Lulu is worthy of a major motion picture. Unfortunately, The Chaperone is not it. The Chaperone is an enjoyable film if taken on its own terms; it is a well produced, high quality, made for tv Masterpiece presentation, grounded in excellent performances by Elizabeth McGovern and Haley Lu Richardson as the young Louise Brooks at the very beginning of her meteoric, and brief, career. The high audience scores reward this effort, and some of the critics concur. On its own terms, this is a fine enough small movie. The majority of critics, however, believe that Julian Fellowes chose to tell the wrong story, and I tend to agree. It would be interesting to know about the pre-production conversations underlying this choice. As written, The Chaperone is a tale of changing social mores and, especially, women's liberation (especially regarding sex), framed by a contrast between a respectable older woman (McGovern) suffocating in a sham marriage with a closeted homosexual and the daring young flapper Louise Brooks (Richardson), hellbent to defy convention, shatter taboos and reach for the stars. To the first situation, Fellowes brings a jaded British aristocratic sensibility, sneering at the conservative sexual ethics of Wichita, Kansas, in the 1920's. To the second ... well, that brings us to Louise Brooks, the REAL Louise Brooks, not the legend so beloved by the modern critics eager to make her an icon of social and sexual liberation. The truth is that young Louise was raped by a neighbor at age 9; she was likely a classic example of the frequently catastrophic effects of very early sexual abuse (e.g. depression, alcohol and drug abuse, chronic promiscuity and an inability to form stable emotional relationships). Louise's story is unfortunately far too common -- and she was far from the only Hollywood horror story -- but most such tragedies play out far from the limelight, in neighborhoods just like yours and mine. From childhood on, Louise was a badly damaged young woman caught in a self-destructive spiral.  Fleeing Kansas at age 15 to study and perform with the prestigious Denishawn School of Dancing, she was fired at age 17. She caught on as a New York showgirl and was soon a semi-nude dancer in the Ziegfield Follies. She caught the eye of Hollywood producers (both in and out of bed) and made her film debut at 19. She spent the next three years as a society sensation in Hollywood A-list circles and was a regular visitor at William Randoph Hearst's San Simeon estate. Her film career during this outwardly glamorous period was mediocre, consisting mainly of supporting roles in forgotten films, but she was much in demand as a young starlet valued as eye candy and as a party girl. She recklessly bedded everyone from stagehands to costars, from Charlie Chaplin to Walter Wagner (Paramount) to William Paley (CBS) to George Preston Marshall. She was married at 20 and divorced at 22. By 1929, she had poisoned the well in Hollywood enough to flee to Europe, where she made three films in less than a year before returning to the U.S. (Her two German films are regarded as her best work.) On her return, she was still a big enough name to try to restart a career, but she had soured on Hollywood and Hollywood had soured on her; she was trouble and too hot to handle. (The modern term ""hot mess"" is probably a considerable understatement.) She was bankrupt by age 26 and was done in Hollywood by 1938, at age 32. She bounced back briefly to Wichita and then moved to New York, where she worked as a shop clerk. She fell back on what she did best, working as a high class courtesan; as her appeal eroded, she became a common prostitute with escort agencies. By this time, she was a suicidal pill-popping alcoholic who probably survived mainly because one of her wealthy lovers from her glory years had arranged a monthly stipend; nonetheless, in her autobiography she admits to contemplating suicide. She was living as a recluse in New York when she was eventually rediscovered in the 1950's by an historian of the film industry and was persuaded to write on her experiences. She showed enough talent to find a second life as a capable writer, but she still died alone and in near-poverty in 1985.  Given this history, I am befuddled at the clamor of the critics who want a movie that celebrates Louise Brooks as an exciting symbol of women's liberation and the sexual revolution. Hers is, rather, a disastrous story of everything that can go wrong. A suicidal, pill popping alcoholic prostitute as a symbol of women's liberation? Really!!!??? Yes, she was one of the brightest celebrities in Hollywood for about three years. She lived big. She looked sultry onscreen and her daring haircut became iconic; there's a memorial for you. And she crashed as hard as one can crash. The Chaperone briefly acknowledges the child sex abuse but quickly moves on, with Louise's defiant refusal to be a victim. (A textbook case of denial, but I digress.) It hints at the grim afterstory in an epilogue at the end of the film, but only makes reference to some ""hard years"" in New York. It presents Louise Brooks in the ascendant, played with great verve and charm by Haley Lu Richardson, though with the sex largely stripped out and the heavy drinking -- she was already abusing alcohol as a young teen -- limited to one scene. (In The Chaperone, she's 15 and just leaving home; Louise at 20 or 22, with her life already disintegrating behind the glamorous facade, would require  a completely different storyline.)  This would be a movie worth making, provided one could find and match three different actresses of very different ages to play Louise at the appropriate stages of her life. But anyone contemplating such a movie should think very, very carefully about the story they intend to tell. The iconic flapper with the bob haircut and with the world as her oyster represents the shortest period of her life, and the rest is tragedy."
The Chaperone,47,75,audience,"The Chaperone tells a charming little story in a visually pleasant period drama. The costumes, the music and the beautiful aesthetic of the 1920s are nice but don't change the fact that it's an insignificant and forgettable film."
The Chaperone,47,75,audience,Throughly charming and enjoyable in a long forgotten context of art deco and flapper extraordinaire Lulu. The girl who spay Hollywood out!
The Chaperone,47,75,audience,"I've been a fan of Louise Brooks for most of my life, I've seen all of her surviving films and read her biography multiple times. I loved the book The Chaperone, but the film was incredibly disappointing, mostly because of casting. Haley Richardson was a poor choice for Louise, she doesn't have the sultry grace and presence and is not the same kind of beauty. Louise was often cast as vampy characters, she had a sexy, dark intensity about her, and Haley is just too cutesy, she'd be more fitting playing someone like Clara Bow. 
The acting was also just forced and insincere. Elizabeth McGovern was the only saving grace and kept the film from totally bombing. It really failed the book. So disappointing."
The Chaperone,47,75,audience,"Great! Sucks that this site gives it only 44%, it is worth heaps more!  Lovely set and costumes. Not normally something i'd watch but couldn't keep off it when i flicked through channels."
The Chaperone,47,75,audience,I was rather disappointed in the movie considering one of the producers was Julian Fellowes from Downton Abby.

""The Chaperone"" is like telling the Tiger Woods story by choosing to focus on his first caddy. Sure, it's a way in, but unless that caddy has a really good story, what are we doing here?
 "
The Chaperone,47,75,critic,"
Films like this have a general necessity in providing alternative options for certain demographics, but it helps if they're attempting to do something; whether it be comedic or dramatic, but this little picture fails at both.
 "

'The Chaperone' is a story about a woman who is changing alongside a changing country, making discoveries about herself in late middle age.
 "
The Chaperone,47,75,critic,"
Static and stilted...
 "
The Chaperone,47,75,critic,"
The film might be set in a different period, but its themes resonate today, with Louise and Norma showing the transformation of two quite different women living through a period of cultural change.
 "
The Chaperone,47,75,critic,"
The Chaperone is produced by PBS Masterpiece and is being shown in theaters, but it feels more suited to television. The budget is clearly lower for things like wigs and backdrops and old-age makeup to the extent that it's noticeable.
 "
The Chaperone,47,75,critic,"
It all adds up to a charming, heartbreaking and heartwarming two hours of emotion-inducing entertainment.
 "
The Chaperone,47,75,critic,"
It's an entertaining look at a culture in transition. And it captures some of the reckless spirit that Louise Brooks would hone onscreen during the next decade of her brief but memorable career.
 "
The Chaperone,47,75,critic,"
Not so much a bad film as it is underwhelming and falling short of its promise, all The Chaperone really achieves is wetting our appetites for a full feature about Louise Brooks
 "
The Chaperone,47,75,critic,"
While The Chaperone is still eminently watchable, the slender, selective view we get of the endlessly intriguing Brooks will slightly annoy those familiar with her enduring legend.
 "
The Chaperone,47,75,critic,"
If you relax your twanging synapses (after viewing any Avenger movie), breathe, and slow your pace down, The Chaperone is actually rather enjoyable. And it will give you much to ponder afterward.

The Public,66,79,audience,"This was an excellent representation of the homeless community, and the fact that they are people who are worthy to be loved and heard. It was also nice to see Estevez and Slater in a movie again."
The Public,66,79,audience,An interesting topic but the execution is flat and mundane.
The Public,66,79,audience,"Excellent, authentic filmmaking! I can relate because I've been working in a public library for 32 years."
The Public,66,79,audience,"I actually loved the idea behind the movie and it was almost well-directed and somewhat well-acted but Emilio Estevez unfortunately shouldn't have picked himself for the role, just didn't fit and boy he can not act."
The Public,66,79,audience,"The Public is a well meaning but flawed film that entertains but doesn't truly satisfy in total. Emilio Estevez not only stars in this film but also wrote and directed it. He plays Stuart Goodson, a supervisor at the Public Library of Cincinnati. Each day the library welcomes homeless people to its space, but one night as the weather turns arctic the homeless decide to stay the night as shelters in the city aren't equipped to take them in. It's all very peaceful but the media and the police paint it as perhaps a hostage situation leading to inevitable conflict. The film makes interesting commnetary on how society looks after the vulnerable and what role public institutions play in this, but it does feel like the film skims the surface a little at times. It is quite entertaining though, thanks to a good cast that includes Alec Baldwin and Jeffrey Wright."
The Public,66,79,audience,"I quite liked it, the movie is clasified as a drama, I would call it more a ""comic drama"", there were several attempts at humour"
The Public,66,79,audience,"A quirky, offbeat film that deals with the homeless population all too often forgotten by society.  I appreciated the spotlight on the issue and admire the effort.  Jeffrey Wright, Alec Baldwin, and Emilio Estevez deliver nice performances even though the script is somewhat uneven."
The Public,66,79,audience,"The Public is an interesting idea with a lot of star power behind it yet the decisions made by some of the characters and a major lack of realism portrayed is frustrating at best. What this film tries to commentate on is an important subject that deserves to be tackled right, not treated with kid gloves. Definitely ambitious it what it wants to communicate, but way too reserved to pull it off. I'm guessing there were some rewrites and I doubt the actors, writers and director are all that happy with the outcome."
The Public,66,79,audience,"I work for a library, so it resonated well with me and my job.  Also the acting was great and the social commentary, spot on."
The Public,66,79,audience,"Powerful social commentary which is a sad mirror of our times.
Wonderful cast,  direction, script  and music."

Somewhat light-hearted in its tone, The Publicis clearly a labor of love for its extraordinary cast.
 "

A timely social drama.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
The Public is hokey and entertaining, well-intentioned yet simplistic, both crowd-pleasing and shamelessly manipulative.
 "

Estevez has assembled a quality ensemble cast here, though one can't help but feel like he's given them B-grade material to work with.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
It's heart is in the right place in many ways, but it just outlines everything so clearly in red marker that it doesn't let you discovers things for yourself. Still, it's an estimable effort in some ways.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
With the tender influence of writer-director-star Emilio Estevez on both sides of the camera, it emerges as something warm, smart and shamelessly uplifting.
 "

That everything ends on a weird happy-clappy high is indicative of a scattershot project that could have done with less ambition, more focus.

A mix of eloquence and satire, in this homeless mass uprising takeover of one of the last remaining US sanctuaries for bookworms and the homeless alike, the public library.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
The Public presents a heartening story of triumph of good over evil, but sadly lacks the gravitas one would usually expect from these types of stories.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
Credit to Estevez for making this but it's quite thin, offers no real solutions and has tired characterisations.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
It's all a bit old-fashioned and earnest but with US civil liberties under attack, it's a timely celebration of humanity.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
It is a film with its heart in the right place, but the dialogue and characterisation are both plonkingly unconvincing.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
At times feels a worthy successor to the social issue dramas that were a trademark of Stanley Kramer in the civil rights era.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
The canvas is broad, with lots of supporting characters and subplots, and while the writing is heavy-handed at times in the Golden Age of Television style, Estevez imbues the movie with a large and generous heart.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
Yes, it's earnest and it tries a little too hard, but it sucked me in.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
Well-acted but preachy, sometimes corny civics lesson melodrama that's just touching enough and funny enough to come off.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
There is something decidedly old-fashioned about the storytelling in The Public, but maybe there's truth to the idea that we need to understand and appreciate the past if we're ever going to be able to move forward together.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
Written, directed by and starring Emilio Estevez, The Public is a pleasantly old-fashioned crowd-pleaser, which argues that libraries are the last great bastion of modern democracy, since they provide free access to knowledge, community and shelter.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
It's a beautifully shot and directed film that openly wears its heart on its sleeve as an ode to one of the last surviving bastions of free information and public space - the public library.
 "
The Public,66,79,critic,"
Leaving you with something to think about as you leave the cinema, The Public is both entertaining and informative.

Totally Under Control,99,85,audience,"An infuriating documentary about the Trump administration's mishandling of the pandemic, 'Totally Under Control' can be a depressing watch at times, but it gets its point across in a very effective manner.  Many more documentaries will be made about the last year, but this one is very well put together.  Everyone should watch this."
Totally Under Control,99,85,audience,"It's unsettling to see revisionist history happening in real time. I was halfway through this before I realized it was a ""mockumentary"", I thought it was going to be legit when I started it. Even as a liberal I found it incredibly biased and extremely dishonest."
Totally Under Control,99,85,audience,"I think this is a well researched documentary,  I also think you walk away from this feeling the same way most all the experts who the production team interviewed in this film. 

Trump's non-stop downplaying of the real threat of Covid-19 and the Right wing news machine's loop of constantly discredeting the doctors, scientist and experts 
lead America to it's embarrassing disastrous response to the epidemic of 2020.  

History will not be kind to Trump and his enablers."
Totally Under Control,99,85,audience,"Biased Trump hit piece short on any of the actual science. Glosses over any faults not attributed to Trump, and attributed to bureaucracy(CDC, FDA etc.), emphasizes and distorts minor faults - although there are definitely some fair points/criticisms -  and goes out of it's way to distort positive things or to cryptically blame the 'economic guys'. The comparison to South Korea is fairly brief, and disappears later in the documentary as it descends into blatant politically biased slander. Fails to take a broad look at mistakes that were made, and positive actions that were taken all over the world, and doesn't give any sort of overview or neutral outlook on the virus and pandemics in general. We're still in the midst of the pandemic, but ""Trump bad, everything is his fault, and systemic racism"". Very, very one-sided, and lacking in substance."
Totally Under Control,99,85,audience,"Should play in prime time on every network. If you havent voted yet, this should be required viewing. Every American deserves to know the truth of our government's covid response. This film peels back the curtain using documentation and film that cannot be denied."
Totally Under Control,99,85,audience,"This documentary is an absolute must see. It exposes the mistakes made by the current administration and many government agencies to handle COVID-19. It includes facts to support any opinions made and includes many experts at the top of their field. Despite remaining on top of the news through this pandemic, I learned of many personally unknown efforts, and failures, by the administration to handle the virus."
Totally Under Control,99,85,audience,"I expected to watch a couple minutes before moving on to something more fun. Instead I was glued to the screen for two hours. We've all lived through it, but it's clarifying to see the disaster unfold, day-by-day, sometimes even hour-by-hour. Some of the bungles are simply mind boggling. For example, we hear from one of the young volunteers (volunteers!!!!) who were put in charge (by Jared) of procuring PPE for our ravaged hospitals. Meanwhile, we see nurses crying in front of hospitals where they tried to use garbage bags as PPE (garbage bags!!), and eventually we see governors smuggling in supplies.  Ultimately, the picture of what went wrong is all too clear."
Totally Under Control,99,85,audience,Absolutely horrible. Very little facts and extraordinarily biased.
Totally Under Control,99,85,audience,"This movie is total garbage. It's basically one giant covid documentary directed at bashing President Trump. The entire film is just painting him as the bad guy. Don't get me wrong, hindsight is a beautiful thing and I'm sure the US could have done things differently but wow. This movie is blatantly a political move from the opposition to make Trump look terrible right be this election. VERY BIASED!"
Totally Under Control,99,85,audience,"We obviously all know how much our current administration has fucked us all over and made the pandemic way more of a nightmare than it needed to be, but this still shed light on many things I didn't know about regarding everything that was ignored to save lives earlier this year when Covid hit. This might be one of the most important documentaries ever made, for not only exposing one of the most heinous and fraudulent acts of United States presidency but doing so in such an accurate and timely fashion.

Everything for a Reason,,100,audience,"If romantic films are your thing this is one you need to watch.

Manny's friend Teddy is trying desperately to win back Jenny, and gets Mike's help to trick her into giving him another chance. Mike is dating Joanne, who happens to be Eve's sister. Every character in this film has their own romantic situation which really adds more to the plot. A real romantic puzzle!"
Everything for a Reason,,100,audience,Such a good indie can't believe I only just found this flick. Well acted and a great script. Funniest part is the scene where the two main actors hook up for the first time.  Really funny - a must watch!
Everything for a Reason,,100,audience,"This story of love, romance and everything in between follows twenty-something, Greek-American Manny and his circle of friends, including brother Anthony, insecure Teddy and ladies-man Mike as they each pursue the fairer sex in their own ways. Teddy is still after Jenny, the girlfriend he just dumped, despite her best friend's efforts to keep them apart, and convinces Mike to help him in a scheme to get her back. Meanwhile, juggling artist Mike is dating both his long-term girlfriend, Wendy, as well as his new fling Joanne, who happens to be the sister of Eve, who starts dating Manny despite a rather catastrophic night of drinking. Sarcastic, sensitive and sexy, this romantic comedy's dialog sparkles (at times reminiscent of genre classic When Harry Met Sally), from a clever ploy by Teddy to win Jenny back, to an exchange between Mike and Manny on cheating. Eve and Manny's first hook-up is a hilarious comedy of errors (inexperienced lovers take note!) illustrating how not to go on a first date. Filled with surprisingly insightful aphorisms about love and life and a charming cast of characters, Everything for a Reason is the kind of film that leaves viewers with a warm feeling on a cold winter morning, a delicious antidote to the Sturm und Drang that pervade independent cinema.

Tenet,70,76,audience,"Good movie, although the sound mixing feels a bit off. The action scenes (especially Close Combat) are far better choreographed than in his Batman movies."
Tenet,70,76,audience,"TENET is a thrilling, complex, inventive, and loud take on time traveling. 

I have this personal problem with Nolan. I know there's no intention here to understand every single thing (cause you won't). My problem is that I feel he tries too hard to make this happen. He complicates things to a level that you know you're enjoying this epic and mind-blowing sequences you're watching, but you just can't finish understanding what's happening. Relax. You're not an idiot, cause yeah, a lot of things will click by the end. Some of them will not. At least that was my experience the first time around. Visually stunning and exciting (as we already knew it was going to be), narratively complex, and at times pretentious. 

Also, ‘The Protagonist', don't know if it was my perception but I didn't get emotionally invested in it. Didn't felt a thing for him. The same happened to me with Dunkirk. It lacked this characterization and the human element that to me, is key to make the experience a bit more exciting and real. Pattinson and Debicki were good. I love seeing Pattinson out of his glittery skin (I know, I have to get over his Edward character, it's been a while, and he IS a great actor). While I liked Debicki's story, I didn't like that the only female character was abused and suffered through the whole movie. Now that I think of this, female characters are always the same in Nolan's films. Why, tho? 

The score in hands of Ludwig Goransson gives the film a hype that, without it, I'm completely sure it wouldn't work as well as it does. It was very Nolan, with notes from Hans Zimmer too. Nolan went loud on this one and for me, it worked. Do yourself a favor and watch this film on the biggest screen possible (the IMAX experience was amazing). The sound and the visuals are a worthy trip back to the cinema. 

Overall, the experience was exciting, at times changeling (and frustrating), but we too knew that was happening, and it's ok. I'm sure it will get better and better with every watch."
Tenet,70,76,audience,"Excruciatingly boring, largely hollow and devoid of any emotion. Tenet is a major bummer.

My verdict: D"
Tenet,70,76,audience,"Great movie. Got a little confusing at times but they said at the beginning ""don't try to understand it."" Also Nolan's movies are known to be complex. Once you understand it you see how well done the movie is."
Tenet,70,76,audience,I love Christopher Nolan and was waiting a long time to see this one... even longer because of the pandemic... only to be disappointed. There are occasional moments of brilliant storytelling bogged down by excessively expositional plotting and flat acting... Pass on this one and watch memento and inception again...
Tenet,70,76,audience,not interesting enough to demand attention and too confusing without paying attention. too many cuts and random scenes. feels like this movie was released before the final cut.
Tenet,70,76,audience,"Judging by the overall atmosphere, music accompaniment, and aesthetic Tenent is the best of Nolan's works so far. The plot a bit too twisted and is hard to follow, but it does not spoil the overall joe the movie gives."
Tenet,70,76,audience,Sucked at many points. And then I mean not the plot.
Tenet,70,76,audience,The trailer looked great. How amazing then that everything from the trailer is coming up in the first 30min of the movie. After that lots of boring lengths and lots of bizarre scenes that don't really add up.
Tenet,70,76,audience,"First time watching this movie I can surely say the technical works and the effect is marvelous, the messy plot I think it's still pretty clear but understanding the whole reverse time mechanism is the biggest threat for the experience to enjoy this movie. The second time watching it I got a lot more information out of it but there still a feeling where I think I just barely scratch the surface even after a lot of ""explained"" video on YouTube. The music I think it's good, it can be overwhelming sometimes but I always turn on the Subtitle anyway so I'm still fine with it being a little loud. In terms of performance, John David Washington as the main protagonist is really great both in dialogue and physical performance but I'm gonna be honest, from emotional stand point almost everyone a bit lacking including his character. Overall this is not my favorite Nolan's movie but still a great addition into his line up of amazing directed film."

As a delivery system for the thrills, I think the film gets a long way, and you can kind of sit back and enjoy it. As a delivery system for the ideas, I think it trips itself up an awful lot.

...a high-faluting, high energy, uber-glam espionage thriller...
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
Just go with it. Allow the inversion to pull you along because it does, for the most part, make sense by the end.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
Huge scale, gripping and ambitious sci-fi spy thriller from Christopher Nolan, which simply has to be seen to be believed, and possibly seen more than once to be fully appreciated.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
It's the most Nolan movie ever and I'm not sure it makes since but I was enthralled nonetheless.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
The future is now or in the past
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
Nolan's obsession with making his films as complex as humanly possible is frustrating for those of us who would like at least a scintilla of clarity in our storytelling.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
Washington and Pattinson have palpable charisma, but this cold puzzle offers no incentive to solve it. Throw in damsel-in-distress crap, and both my geek sensibilities and my feminism are offended.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
Something like the epitome of [Nolan's] temporally twisty canon, distilling his many cinematic signatures and preoccupations down to their entrancing abstract essence.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
Nolan's reverence for tech and the cleverness of pulling off a metaphysical narrative puzzle finally swamps his awareness of whether the thing in question is even any good.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
The trippy last hour is jam packed with artfully arranged action scenes that manipulate time in increasingly psychedelic ways.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
Tenet has its moments, but is easily Nolan's worst film. Mostly incomprehensible; this muddled sci-fi thriller is a long way from being the ""savior of cinema."" Honestly, it'd be difficult to recommend even if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
Tenet asks for patience as it winds forward and backward through its narrative accordion structure...savor, even [its] flaws.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
...'Tenet' makes 'Inception' feel like a children's story. The film is magnificently and perhaps quite purposefully confusing.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
Tenet isn't here to collect Oscars. It exists to pummel you with excitement, twist your sense of reality, and leave you confounded with the deafening power of its nine-figure budget.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
The weakest of Nolan's 11 cinematic at-bats to date, Tenet finds the filmmaker unable to get out of his own way as he attempts to spin a yarn that makes earlier efforts like Memento seem as linear and uncomplicated as A Charlie Brown Christmas.
 "
Tenet,70,76,critic,"
I love Tenet so much, despite its frustrations. Nolan wants to keep pushing the boundaries of these kinds of blockbusters, and that means he's going to fail as much as he succeeds.

She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,audience,"If you want to die today watch this movie, joke aside, I can try and understand and analyse all the hidden meanings, the disease of the mind  and the psycho-sociological message of the movie, but it still boring to death"
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,audience,"She Dies Tomorrow has a very original premise, some very effective genre sequences and a solid style to it, but the movie's slow pace made it a far from engaging watch, the lack of dialogue was also frustrating and the focus should have been much stronger. It's an authentic movie that needed a much better execution overall."
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,audience,"Started off intriguing then nothing happened, no explanation just indie nothingness. Not worth your time of day."
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,audience,"Amy Seimetz's She Dies Tomorrow is quite possibly the fartsiest artsy movie of the year that begins by executing itself through such prime examples of indie clichés that I wasn't sure how seriously I should take it. The film then goes 0 to 60 with little care for narrative cohesion or drive, but sure as hell is going to let you know Mozart's ""Requiem"" composition is the shit! 

If you're going to make me take a Tom DeLonge glance at what's going on though (dolphin fucking), at least have the confusion make for a lasting impression. With this only being Seimetz's second feature to direct and her first in eight years the instinct to ""go for broke"" is understandable, but the whole thing just feels like one big exercise in trying to figure out how to tell a friend or family member they're being stupid without letting them in on the fact you think they're stupid. It's an anxiety game. An anxiety game that turns into a game called ""what vaguely familiar face is going to get infected with an existential crisis next?"" 

Bonus points for the plague allegory though; couldn't feel timelier and could totally get into the wrong (or right) person's head if watched under quarantine restrictions."
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,audience,"This is an amazing movie. Not sure about which genre is falls into, as it crosses into multiple genres, styles. The visuals are incredibly affecting. Jan Addams and Kate Lyn Sheil are both powerful in their roles- both shattered, or shattering before our eyes. 
The visual work like the late scene of the blood on the microscope and screen is remarkable. Unsettling, jarring with a lot of jump starts and sudden bursts of music and almost screaming choral vocals, She Dies Tomorrow is powerful stuff for sure. 3.8 stars"
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,audience,"Actress Amy Seimetz slowly cemented herself in the past decade as one of the most underappreciated surrealistic voices out there, even directing a few episodes of the ground-breaking show 'Atlanta'. With 'She Dies Tomorrow' she uses almost virtually no narrative to convey the very idea of existential dread with the help of a simple, yet disarming premise: Amy, a young woman (played by Kate Lyn Sheil) is absolutely certain that she will die the following day. Any person she transmits her fatidic prophecy to is ""infected"" with her fear of imminent death, paying it forward to others in turn.

Every sound effect and horrifying blinding light that Seimetz directs is there for the sole purpose of reinforcing a palpable fear of death, slowly instilling it in our brains. Short and sour, 'She Dies Tomorrow' marches forward with fatalistic rethoric, creating a really solid, although story-less work of existential horror."
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,audience,haunting and captivating 
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,audience,Good premise. Poor execution. Boring. Tedious. Goes nowhere.
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,audience,"What initially seemed very promising, as such strides of boldness are usually only undertaken in the beginning of a film by the most pristine of movies, presentation, ended up being truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It willingly set the bar as high as could be, and I announced early on that I would hold the movie to high scrutiny. One not need hold this movie to high scrutiny to see the true atrocity with which they penned this script. Nothing even remotely resembling an entertaining plot line, meaningful character development, or any of the fundamental aspects for engagement in a film were present in the least bit in any meaningful way. If there was an attempt made, it certainly was hidden quite well. The entire movie, egotistically puffed up with being deep and hard to understand drags on and on, leaving you desperate for some sort of engaging sequence of events only to end on a scene just as dull as the rest. I actually am not a consequentialist, I do not believe that the ends justify the means, and if rewarding half of a star on this website was a form of giving credit, you would not be reading this review right now. The only reason I can post this review and not feel that I have violated my conscience is because of the provided summary of the half star raring ""Oof, that was Rotten.""

If you are considering watching this, and you are going through reviews to determine if you should, I do not seek to tell you what to do with your life. But you can never, ever tell me that I did not warn you.

SHIT. FILM. ABSOLUTE. TRASH."
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,audience,"Theme of existential dread superficially explored via lethargic characters, with occasional flashing colors and jarring cuts to give the illusion that something interesting is happening. Stylistically Lynch-lite, but far too few ideas for 84 mins."
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
Forget the weepy schmaltz of stereotypical terminal illnesses dramas, because this haunting film couldn't be steeped any deeper in existential terror.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
A dizzying and an extraordinarily ambitious project, if She Dies Tomorrow doesn't hit you in the guts, you should probably check your pulse.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
This is a tale about grappling with the things you have no control over.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
It doesn't congeal in the end, and it ends before it really knows what to do with its premise.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
She Dies Tomorrow promises to be an inventive exploration of anxiety but it's just far too indulgent and ultimately lacks depth.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
A beautiful, funny, sad film about intimations of mortality from writer/director Amy Seimetz.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
She Dies Tomorrow is the kind of film that makes people hate arthouse movies. The title seems to promise a certain type of experience, but the film delivers something completely different. It may be art, but it sure as hell isn't entertainment.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
I felt a connection not only to the characters but to the director too.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
A gorgeous and affecting nightmare with a weight of timeliness that can't be ignored.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
In a time where COVID-19 has spread worldwide, bringing angst and unease, a movie that examines human behavior in the face of transmittable trauma is, perhaps, a nightmarish artistic inevitability.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
To paraphrase: The only thing we have to fear is fear of death itself.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
While She Dies Tomorrow is a deeply melancholic film, Seimetz is able to sneak her pitch-black humor into moments such as when Amy decides she would like to be turned into a leather jacket.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
Comes across like a glorified student film rather than a contemplative exercise in existential anxiety.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
It does one thing very well, and it does it with no little amount of style.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
There are parts of this film where the action is so slow that you can speed up the video playback to twice normal speed, and it still looks slow. The faint, mumbling dialog doesn't help, either.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
It's a mood piece more than anything else, sometimes unsettling, sometimes hilarious, and always intriguing.
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
There's no doubt that the idea is ingenious... but on screen it doesn't have as much force as it should. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
The film is never less than time-passingly bonkers, but I rarely found it much more than that either, and its plot is so deliberately opaque that it seems to be daring you to mentally check out at every non-turn and un-twist.

 "
She Dies Tomorrow,83,23,critic,"
Amy Seimetz's film is a powerful, unshakeable slice of horror cinema. This is a grand, great film, one that feels all too relatable, and is all too proud for knowing that too.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,audience,"I wanted to like this film so much, but it just left me wanting more. Not enough of a drama or a comedy to be considered either. The ending was also so far out of left field that I just felt rushed."
Irresistible,40,64,audience,"I thought the idea and the overarching moral of the story were very clever. It was a fun political comedy from Jon Stewart. It was silly here and there but I enjoyed watching it and at the end, it really made you think about things on both sides of the aisle. It was not a one-sided red or blue take at all but the game of politics in general."
Irresistible,40,64,audience,"Brilliant, funny, and terrifying. So much truth shining through the plot, the characters, and the dynamics that allow it all to happen.  Wonderful resolution as well.  Unfortunately, small towns in need won't be the ones benefitting from the horrendous ""election economy"" - and we know who will.   Interesting to see the interview at the end of the movie that explains why nothing will be done to stop it.   Jon Stewart, still cutting through the BS, right to the heart of things."
Irresistible,40,64,audience,"I liked a lot about this, but all in all it's a mess that makes it tough to sympathize with any one character before the third act.  Rose Byrne seems like the only actor who knows what movie she's in, and she deserves a medal."
Irresistible,40,64,audience,"I laughed out loud several times, and that is unusual for me. How often is someone willing to really skewer this stuff and not just certain parts only?  I thought it was funny in the over-the-top, not trying to be particularly inventive, but as a jab/commentary injected with some major basis in truth.  I didn't think it was supposed to be a drama or read like seriously real characters - too much reality would ruin the satire and just make it extremely sad -  but rather supposed to allude to characters and places in an east xaggerated way. Kinda like Ocean's 11 for the pundit class.  A couple of scenes were a little disgusting for me, but only a few, which kinda miraculous in itself.  Enjoyable and fun!"
Irresistible,40,64,audience,"Disappointing.  Starts off well enough for about three quarters of its run time as a mild comedy.  Steve and Rose are amusing, even though the overall situation is pretty unrealistic. (Most small town elections are not national party partisan.) But then  [mild spoiler alert] one of the ""good"" characters does something quite stupid and mean and a plot twist follows which turns pretty much all the seeming  ""good guys"" into scammers.  In the end there is no one left to root for and the movie ends up with a very preachy semi-documentary finish. Apparently we are supposed to have sympathy for small town folks who take advantage of the liberal elite even if it involves lying and conning people.  Left a bad taste in my mouth."
Irresistible,40,64,audience,"I went into this movie with low expectations, but was very pleasantly surprised thanks to the comedic was that this movie addressed the sacred cows of the American election machine and the media's lazy and often uninformed coverage and manipulation of that process. Def worth watching."
Irresistible,40,64,audience,"Witty, real, unbiased, and surprisingly not political as much as it is conversational about our current system. Well done Jon Stewart. "
Irresistible,40,64,audience,"Irresistible has its moments, thanks to Steve Carell's deliveries, but most of it is a movie one would watch to pass time on a flight."
Irresistible,40,64,audience,Clever and engaging. Jon Stewart takes on the system in a novel way. Great cast.
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
Irresistible is far too happy to coast on stereotypes of supposed Democratic and Republican party supporter traits, and for far too long.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
The problem is Irresistible can be a clunky political critique, one that struggles to maintain its momentum and to establish a consistent tone. It's fast, it's slow. It's sarcastic; it's earnest.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
...something of a time-waster, with an absurd 'money-solves-everything' motif...
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
This zingy satire is so perfectly, beautifully Jon Stewart: big and brash, raging with fury at the state of American politics but also underlain with hope that it might be changed for the better.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
Irresistible is an entertaining film in fits and starts, but Stewart doesn't find his storytelling groove until the very end. By that point, many viewers may have already given up.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
Doesn't exactly blaze new ideological ground but the as a reminder of why the political system is twisted and broken, it's a timely tale.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
Missing Jon Stewart's commentary won't save this film for you.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
The intent is timely and noble and there is a third-act twist that makes it almost worthwhile.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
Irresistible represents a missed opportunity to show the world something new when it comes to dirty politics.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
It's plain all along that Stewart has little interest in his characters and their troubles except as a means for him to score didactic points, primarily about the evils of unrestricted campaign financing.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
A sly, consistently witty affair that wisely doesn't exactly choose a political side to skewer; let's call it a comedy for equal opportunists.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
The movie has its funny moments, but the messaging is super overstated and the premise ends up being fairly simplistic.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
Does the media spend too much time framing stories as strictly binary narratives? Sure. Could we have gotten that message in a more straightforward way? Almost certainly.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
If you're wondering what sets this film apart from its satirical peers, it's the confidence its filmmaker has in his audience.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
The more grotesque the film tries to be, the worse off it is. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
Given the opportunities for satirical complexities, Irresistible is disappointingly plain.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
If you're a fan of Carell (or Stewart), you'll lap this up. But if it's sharply honed political satire you crave, you'd be better off binge-watching The Thick of It or Veep, or tracking down a DVD of the truly magnificent Bob Roberts.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
...a well-intentioned misfire that could (and should) have been so much better.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
...its vicious comedic blow - what Stewart would passionately deliver most nights The Daily Show at the end of a rant - never comes.
 "
Irresistible,40,64,critic,"
Beyond simply failing to amuse or offering any political substance in what is ostensibly a political comedy, Stewart is actively reckless in his message.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,audience,"I liked Pete Davidson more before I saw this movie. Man is he a Loser and a Whiner, and those tattoes are ugly as Hell. Don't know why Marissa Tomei accepted that role. The guy who played the fireman was the bright spot of the movie."
The King of Staten Island,75,83,audience,"A charming comedy about Pete Davidson that is lengthy, but doesn't waste your time. A great cast and good jokes keeps the runtime breezy, along with other complex characters and true human moments we expect from Apatow. Burr and Tomei are also fantastic and it's hard to not root for Davidson's Scott when all is said and done. Good movie."
The King of Staten Island,75,83,audience,A very funny movie with also some uplifting moments. I found it weird seeing Bill Burr here in some scenes but he did a great job his co-star Pete Davidson also did an amazing job.
The King of Staten Island,75,83,audience,"No matter how hard the filmmakers and cast tried to sell this story of an angst-ridden millennial perpetually mourning the loss of his firefighter father, I didn't buy it -- not for a minute, despite a semi-autobiographical story and script by protagonist Pete Davidson. Director Judd Apatow's overlong, unfocused comedy (a term I use loosely) takes far too long to find its feet, and it does so with an endless string of snappy, smarmy one-liners that don't jibe with the supposedly fragile mental state of the allegedly troubled lead character. And, when the film finally does start to move forward, the narrative's warm, fuzzy conclusion lacks plausibility in light of its cynical setup, a problem made worse by steaming heaps of melodrama and inordinately saintly characters primed for canonization. While the picture genuinely features a fine performance by Marisa Tomei, its attempt at making Davidson's character into more than the one-dimensional player he is sorely falls short, a fate not unlike that shared by many other former SNL regulars who have attempted to transition from the small to the big screen. In all, the premise here is shaky to begin with, and it's made all the worse by too many tangents, insufficient clarity and poor execution, suspicions that first surfaced when I screened the trailer and that became all too apparent while sitting through this endless slog."
The King of Staten Island,75,83,audience,I really enjoyed this movie a lot and would highly recommend it to anyone if they have not seen it yet.
The King of Staten Island,75,83,audience,"Meh..

Mostly a lot of  middle-class family comedic drama involving sisters... I have no idea what this behavior and these relationships are.  I can click with the settings and some of the situations but not with any of the characters or their relationships with each other.  I don't know if it's good or bad, none of the jokes or humor really landed with me."
The King of Staten Island,75,83,audience,"Love it ! A little long , but the progression and plot were amazing and so funny and heartfelt. "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,audience,"This is an amazing movie put together by Pete Davidson.  It's both heartfelt and hilarious.  The King of Staten Island is awesome, and I'm sure Pete's father would be proud, may he rest in peace."
The King of Staten Island,75,83,audience,Its a great movie 100% recommend it!
The King of Staten Island,75,83,audience,"Originally I had no desire to see this show.  Then I heard Pete on the Talking Sopranos podcast and thought I would give it a try.  Glad I did.  This was not a perfect show, but Pete Davidson's story is a good one.  It does stumble a bit, but his life has had stumbles.  The supporting cast was really good too."
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
If you've ever felt lost and not knowing what to do with your life, you will connect with the story. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
While it doesn't reach its potential, The King of Staten Island has enough going for it that it's worth a lukewarm recommendation. Just don't expect it to enjoy a long reign in your heart.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
The King of Staten Island may or may not turn out to be Davidson's Trainwreck, the film that brought Amy Schumer into the mainstream. But it shows that he has much more to offer than he has shown on SNL, a welcome development for any comedy lover.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
The premise of The King of Staten Island doesn't sound like the stuff of comedy but this story of how tragedy effects a family balances humour with heartfelt and humanistic observations in a very winning way.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
King is perhaps Apatow at his most tender, amplifying the tugging of heartstrings more than the elicitation of belly-laughs.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
It ends up as a middling entry in Apatow's filmography, but is easily his most earnest.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
The movie is definitely sprawling and overlong, but Davidson's aching vulnerability gives it wonky charm and heart, while his goofy comic sensibility proves well matched to Apatow's relaxed, improvisational style.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
A touching story about the stumbling blocks some people face when searching for their place in the world, and the value that friendship and mentorship add when trying to move forward in life.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
Director Judd Apatow's best film, he does a masterful job balancing moments of sincere emotion with genuine humor, never letting the over two-hour running time lag.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
Every time he makes a film these days, it's as if Apatow got carried away at the pick-and-mix and walked off without realising the bag has split.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
Emotionally disarming, but meandering and laconic, it doesn't quite pack the punch it wants.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
The movie should be a self-indulgent chore, but never comes close to that, thanks to Davidson's charismatically awkward presence, and the colourfully committed performances of a great support cast led by Marisa Tomei and stand-up comedian Bill Burr.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"

 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
The King of Staten Island  is much like Scott himself. It struggles to find its feet and flounders most of its time. Once it lifts, it manages to be a funny, heartwarming piece of work.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
It's a film full of characters who have to say ""I'm sorry"" a lot. Bottom line, though-they're all quite recognizably and vibrantly human.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
The King of Staten Island is worth seeing for its humour, its themes and its performances.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
Beautiful and funny, honest and heartfelt, The King of Staten Island may very well be my favorite Judd Apatow film to date.
 "
The King of Staten Island,75,83,critic,"
... Staten Island is profoundly personal, dark, and unfettered in a way that makes the audience confront their own pain, the kind that they may not realize they inflict on others.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,audience,this felt like a sketch that never got fleshed out
The Lovebirds,65,50,audience,"Hilarious, uproarious comedy. Only reason I took away a star was the unnecessary insertion of exposition from the villain at the end of the movie. Viewers aren't dumb. There were an infinite number of ways that piece of the puzzle could have, should have unfolded, instead of the way it did. With that being said, Issa and Kumail have phenomenal comedic chemistry. Can't wait to see them on screen in another comedy."
The Lovebirds,65,50,audience,"This is the most perfectly 3-star film I've ever seen. Everything about it is average: the plot is insubstantial, the jokes will only make you smile, and the acting isn't great. But all of that makes this adventure quite charming."
The Lovebirds,65,50,audience,"this movie has expected twists in it but the chemistry and all out funny moments between the two leads is worth watching as soon as possible! seriously don't take either of these actors for granted, they are stars!!"
The Lovebirds,65,50,audience,The best thing about the lovebirds is the two leads do you have a good chemistry together. That’s about it. We’ve seen this kind of movie before and the script is predictable with a predictable by the book ending. The movie has some really good set ups for jokes but it doesn’t really know where to go with them. And sadly most of the funny parts are seen during the trailer. I can see how this movie would not have done very well in theaters so it’s good it went straight to Netflix. It has a few good laughs but it really could’ve been a lot funnier and more risks could’ve been taken.
The Lovebirds,65,50,audience,"The two leads are clearly funny and talented, but this is one of the worst scripts I've seen in years. There are a few funny moments, but this is a tough watch"
The Lovebirds,65,50,audience,"Had some chuckles, but had a scattered plot"
The Lovebirds,65,50,audience,"There’s a few laughs and a whole lot of continuity issues with hair, make-up and wardrobe. "
The Lovebirds,65,50,audience,I've never snorted kombucha out of my nose before. Ow. Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani have chemistry and comedic timing in spades. A perfect comic duo. Thanks for the much needed laugh!!!
The Lovebirds,65,50,audience,"I honestly thought I was tuning in for 1 hour and 27 minutes of pure stupidity and nonsense when I pressed the play button for ""The Lovebirds"". I was kind of wrong. 

I have to start this review with praise for Issa Rae's hilarious performance. Her lines made me cackle like a witch! Though we all can agree this film isn't THE best film, I personally enjoyed it greatly. Being a guy with a nice sense of humor, I thought the jokes weren't too cheesy; I actually found them funny. The chemistry between Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae wasn't the worst (which is code-word for ""good""). The script was pretty decent too. Overall, I'd recommend giving this film a chance before labeling it ""absolutely idiotic"". You never know, you might have a good time.

I'm honestly glad ""The Lovebirds"" didn't premiere in theaters because it would've flopped financially FOR SURE. <3"
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
Nanjiani doesn't stray from what he does best, but his comic sensibilities work so well here. He is, as usual, hilarious.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
The filmmakers either needed to lean more into the insanity or more into Jibran and Leilani's relationship, but both are given relatively short shrift.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
It isn't so much what [the film] does wrong as what it doesn't do right. The film is undermined by perhaps its two greatest strengths, its leads, who are given the heavy task of carrying the weight of the film without a sturdy script to stand on.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
The plot is scattered and unfortunately predictable, whilst the jokes often strain to hold the whole enterprise together.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
The chemistry between Nanjiani and Rae is dynamite, their back-and-forth electric with witty insults and quips, making for a far better time than you might expect. These two deserve a better movie.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
A huge opportunity was missed discussing the couples interracial relationship and different cultural backgrounds, but it's still a cute little movie.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
It may have originally had a cinema release, and it may be a little better than some Netflix original comedies, but The Lovebirds unfortunately doesn't make good enough on its potential to truly stand apart from the pack.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
It has got about as much ingenuity that can be coded into its algorithm. Of course, the intention is to entertain, not to reinvent the rom-com, but it does run through some familiar junctures with a pep in its step.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
A witty send-up of the buddy comedy genre that benefits greatly from its two leads' electric chemistry
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
The Lovebirds fulfills its duty to the audience to be just sweet enough while providing an outlet for Rae and Nanjiani to play off of each other's comedic timing.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
The appealing personalities of [Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani] just can't quite turn this stinking mess of a movie into the comedy feast that it should have been.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
Best of all is the Seinfeldian observational humor asking why cars still have cigarette lighters and why milkshake orders always come with an extra cup. The latter is an instant classic like Jack Nicholson ordering the toast in ""Five Easy Pieces.""
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani are a hilarious duo with great chemistry. The reality of their stakes never felt too intensely dire, but their journey was a ton of fun.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
The Lovebirds is a generally lightweight mystery-comedy, given an extra boost by two hilarious performances from its leads
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
Along with Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani's terrific chemistry together on screen, their comic timing seems perfect. Here's hoping they appear in more movies together.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
Everything was fine, until the plot kicked in, which was only ten minutes into the movie...
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
They work well romantically, in my opinion...the love scenes are sweet and believable, sweet while it lasts though...they even argue like a real couple...
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
Nothing real here...none of it seems to make any sense, just bumbling and stumbling around...
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
An innocuous and lightweight but likable and funny screwball crime comedy.
 "
The Lovebirds,65,50,critic,"
Here's the thing. This movie isn't very good. In fact, it's forgettable and not that funny. I just finished it an hour ago and it's starting to drift from my memory already.

Downhill,38,14,audience,Movie was boring and depressing. Would never recommend this movie to anybody.
Downhill,38,14,audience,"Horrible watch, will not watch again, and warn against.

As much as I am not a fan of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, I thought Will Ferrell would be a proper counter balance.

This is a somewhat closer to the vibe of ""Everything Must Go"", except now the wife and kids are there to actively attack.

That perspective does show that the movie does what it intended to do, have the audience relate to the trouble and turmoil of the characters, but I just don't feel like it amounted to much.

Perhaps this is intended for a very specific audience of ""troubled"" or ""broken"" families trying to stay together, but it really almost feels more like like someone's therapy exercise as an outlet on how to deal with the pain of a similar event."
Downhill,38,14,audience,"A little dull and kindve pointless to watch. Hopefully ""Downhill"" isnt what we need to expect in the future from these 2 iconic careers..."
Downhill,38,14,audience,"I loved it, I empathised a lot with the main character just wanting a fun ski holiday and them getting him down all the time."
Downhill,38,14,audience,"I have never reviewed a movie online before, but this one was so exceptionally terrible that I felt the need to warn anyone considering wasting time from their life watching it. Not funny, just cringey. The scenes are awkward and uncomfortable."
Downhill,38,14,audience,Yawn....(and I'm an avid skier)
Downhill,38,14,audience,"Great movie , don’t get the hate nor do I care lol "
Downhill,38,14,audience,That was 2 hours of suck
Downhill,38,14,audience,Top 20 worst movies I've ever seen.  Awful.
Downhill,38,14,audience,Terrible movie. Angsty and highly over dramatic. I want the hour and a half of my life back. How the hell is this a comedy????
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
There's hardly anything redemptive of Downhill and none of it is enough for me to claim any love for the film... We can make room for other stories.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus are as good together as you'd expect, and we'd love to see them pair in something again soon, be it more serious or far less so.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
""The remake turns a serious magical movie into a shallow one.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
At first, glance seeing the pairing of Dreyfus and Ferrell seems promising; however, the opportunity for cinematic hilarity was wasted.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
Downhill puts two titans of comedy into some supremely difficult situations, and the process of seeing them go through them is more rewarding than a straight-up comedy would have been.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
By the end, it feels like maybe it would have been more fun to have jumped off the edge of a mountain than have watched this couple fight on one.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
It's a bitter little pill, but it worked for me. Proceed with caution and you will be rewarded with an insightful drama.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
I realise why you take great foreign language movies and remake them for English speaking audiences but I'm not sure there's a single element of Downhill that is the equal of the original film.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
Force Majeure literally means ""superior force"" in French, so maybe they had no hope, but there's also something ugly about this latest in a long line of US studios breaking foreign films an attempt at remaking them.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
""Downhill"" retains the essential DNA of ""Force Majeure,"" and therefore remains a strange and prickly piece of work.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
'Downhill' is a perfect word to describe the steep slide into disappointment that your expectations will take when you think about how this movie wastes the talents of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
If you're looking for something a little more than a pretty good comedy/drama, you might come away slightly disappointed.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
You'd be better off seeking out the more effective original than settling for a pale facsimile.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
...it accomplishes what it sets out to, but overall the film seems out of balance. For every moment that is genuinely hilarious and great, there is another that drags on or doesn't quite land.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
The story still works, with the bigger revelations and solutions packing a punch, though it's a shame that it's not original.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
Downhill lives up to its title. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
Takes a troubling and uncomfortable study of human relationships and turns it into mildly entertaining sitcom.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
Lacking chemistry between the two leads, the bottom of Downhill's slippery slope is unsatisfying.
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
This movie starts off with potential, but goes downhill pretty quickly (pun intended).
 "
Downhill,38,14,critic,"
Downhill, like its brash American protagonists, is far more abrasive about its intentions than the very emotionally reserved Forced Majeure. It has less patience for silences, which the Swedish original absolutely revelled in.

On the Record,99,81,audience,"This movie is so engaging and entertaining, It's definitly one of my favorite movies of all time because I know I will remember it"
On the Record,99,81,audience,"fucking powerful. You literally watch a woman (Drew Dixon among MANY others) discover their voice therefore discovering their place in the world again as they brave sharing their scars for the world to see. The fact that Oprah dropped out of this is baffling to me.  Whatever her issue was with the ""artistic direction"" was not worth trying to shelf the truths of these women."
On the Record,99,81,audience,"This doc touches on POC women affected by sexual assault in a way that other films haven't. For me - as a white woman - this film dives more deeply into the complex, intermingled, social contracts between men and women, and more specifically between men and women WITHIN minority populations in the US. 

Aside from the primary focus on sexual assault, power, and race - I was deeply touched by the conversations about what we lose as a society WHEN TALENTED WOMEN DISAPPEAR. I think Drew's story, and her early successes, help us feel the deep implications and loss around this question. 

At on point Drew talks about her pain. She says her pain and her creativity lived in the same compartment of her coping mechanism - this description of how these traumas live inside and alter the course of a person's life is extremely impactful in how we should think about the effects our actions have on others and society."
On the Record,99,81,audience,"I dunno where I've been, but in all of the MeToo stuff I never heard Simmons name. I was happy to see the discussion on the radio show where the hosts were questioning their own biases. 
I feel like that more than anything is my take away. Question my thoughts and why they exist in the first place. Where have I been influenced and does it represent how I want to think going forward. 

I'm grateful for docs like this that allow me to listen to other people's experiences."
On the Record,99,81,audience,An important documentary about a devastating subject that is rarely discussed.
On the Record,99,81,audience,Hm.....................
On the Record,99,81,audience,"Oh God, just the opening of this was the same old tired narrative that we have seen way too many times. I almost turned it off after 5 minutes because I knew where it was going. I have way too much to say, but none of it would pass the moderator muster.

I didn't even know what this was going to be about. I literally thought it was going be about actually vinyl/CD history with the vinyl poster.

Plus so much of what was being said was just inaccurate either from trying to romanticize their past (or un-romanticize) or they just have poor memories regarding the historical aspect of the 90s etc.

Regarding the sexual allegations, I mean, they just didn't make any sense. The first one, he harassed her, but she kept working with him over and over again. What happened to strong women saying no? Is she saying her career and earnings were more important to keep than walking away from being harassed? This sounds more like a regret story than I was trying to get away but got forced into something story. Too many gaps in what she is telling us. It was just the most bizarre story I have ever heard.

Just to recap she left the bar without him trying to get away from hi, but somehow ended up in front of his apartment where he grabbed her and asked her to go upstairs. Even though she wanted to get away from him, she agreed. Once upstairs she goes into the bedroom. You know, the bedroom. Because why not after being harassed by him over and over again and not wanting him near her. Then of course he does what all men do, come into the bedroom fully naked with a rubber on, slams her on the bed, and once she sees the handcuffs on the wall she gets scared and passes out. Yup, you know how it goes.

Guess what. Next she is in the bathtub with him naked. We'll leave out all the details in between of what actually happened and how she got into the bathtub with him, after all, those are just minor details. Then she tells him she is leaving and she walks home 22 blocks, even though she can grab a cab.

She gets home and actually takes a cold shower with ALL her clothes on. Because that is what we do. But she kept working there and even sat on his lap. You know that's what rapists do. They beg their victim to keep working there and offer them more money. Why did they go to the media and not the cops? Don't get me started on this.

If you want to believe that 10% story with 90% missing you go ahead. There was ZERO evidence to back her up, except her hollow story.

The second story one was a 5 second description. Literally. From then on, the stories just seem to get worse and worse. They literally seemed to be making up their stories as they went along.

It must be sad to look at life through race and gender. smh They selective only picked

Over all too much minutia and nonsensical details to fill up a documentary. Who cares about the album she put together?

You can see they had practically no one in this documentary that was from the time. It was just a few nobodies. That should tell you a lot about the legitimacy. This could have been a 30 minute segment on youtube. Feminist gibberish. Overly broad allegations and trying to make connections between things that don't have any evidence to be connected, like the Clarence Thomas and lynching. It was pretty outrageous how far these women are willing to go. It's ironic because the very thing they claim to fight like collectivism they actually use as evidence for their own claims.

You can easily skip this.So predictable..."

 "
On the Record,99,81,critic,"
Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, who co-directed the searing documentary, ""The Hunting Ground,"" about serial rapes on college campuses, have directed another outstanding wedge film.
 "
On the Record,99,81,critic,"
Their stories have not been told. It's shocking to hear, yet so obvious. And that's what makes On the Record such a compelling watch -- it lays out in the clearest possible terms the ramifications for black women who dare to stand up.
 "
On the Record,99,81,critic,"
On the Record is propaganda made on the divide-and-conquer principle of the progressive movement.
 "
On the Record,99,81,critic,"
It is told with conviction and rigorous honesty...
 "
On the Record,99,81,critic,"
By detaching itself from Simmons's legacy, On the Record centers the women's stories.
 "
On the Record,99,81,critic,"
On the Record co-directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering don't lose sight of the overall message...Sexual misconduct should not be excused because of someone's race, and #MeToo survivors should not be shamed or pressured to keep silent because of their race.
 "
On the Record,99,81,critic,"
On The Record does a good job of showing that Black women feel like they have been forgotten during these advancements. For all of us to move forward, their voices need to be heard.
 "
On the Record,99,81,critic,"
It's a poignant reminder for black women that relief can be found if their voices are heard. In order to do that, society needs to listen and On The Record is an important place to start.
 "

The film feels like a brave act of confession from these women, and a passionate plea for justice.

[T]his is the quintessential conversation starter, smartly edited and always thought-provoking.
 "
On the Record,99,81,critic,"
This compelling story of sexual assault and powerful men violently abusing their positions is a reminder than the #MeToo movement didn't begin - or end - with Harvey Weinstein.
 "
On the Record,99,81,critic,"
The real accomplishment of Ziering and Dick's film is to present Dixon's story as an experience unique to black women, at the bottom of a historical hegemony that finds white, rich men very much at the top.

Frozen II,78,92,audience,Worth the wait for a sequel.
Frozen II,78,92,audience,Aburrida y con contradicciones en todos lados. Pero no se puede negar que la animación es espectacular.
Frozen II,78,92,audience,"I want to save everyone time. DO NOT WATCH Frozen 2. It has none of the punch, pizzaz or entertainment value of the first film. The story and songs are lackluster. As a disney channel original I may give this 3.5 stars. As a feature film it is a shameful waste."
Frozen II,78,92,audience,"Really enjoyed it, even if it's not quite as good as the first one. The soundtrack is strong and the lyrics are clever and quotable. 

I also found the movie to be really funny, especially where it gently pokes fun at itself. Kristoff is a highlight in this movie too - his relationship with Anna is strong and realistic, and as a man he's able to be vulnerable too."
Frozen II,78,92,audience,"This film is a masterpiece. It's even better than the first one, it has smarter humour, more than one great song, its conflict is superior and it's just so beautiful, every part of it. It goes into many aspects of paganism and Nordic legends put together and Elsa's character sends all the right messages once again. This is just absolutely perfect, best animated film ever."
Frozen II,78,92,audience,"Might be controversial to say this sequel is better than the original, but it is going to be said anyways. 'Frozen II' does a fantastic job of following up the original story with another great story that keeps you wondering what is happening next. Josh Gad is just as funny in this as he was in the original. Menzel and Bell do great jobs back in their original roles as well. The message is one of incredible strength that I believe girls and boys can take away and enjoy. Anyone can enjoy this movie, especially with the mystical animation and powerful music numbers."
Frozen II,78,92,audience,"This is a really good movie and the spirits are amazing, especially Bruni the salamander."
Frozen II,78,92,audience,"Wow, all I can say is I lowered my expectations from the original but I didn't realize the quality of the story was going to degrade this much.  The first one was expertly paced and written and just a joy to watch.  This one is the complete opposite, lazy, horrendously paced, overly casual, completely lacking in the achievements of the first one.  Barely a sentence of two of dialog before another meaningless song starts that you just wait to be over."
Frozen II,78,92,audience,"A visually stunning movie with a message that more adults will resonate with than kids. ""Show Yourself"" is an absolute showstopper that plusses ""Let it Go"" in every way. Well done, Disney Animation Studios. Well done."
Frozen II,78,92,audience,Too many cringy songs
Frozen II,78,92,critic,"
Like most sequels, Frozen II doesn't quite live up to the first film, but it's far from a waste of time. If nothing else, it's nice to be able to spend some more time with the engaging characters of Arendelle.
 "
Frozen II,78,92,critic,"
The beauty of this sequel is that it is more intricate than the first, namely in plot. It ditches the simplicity of what boiled down to repairing a sister-sister relationship and opts instead for lofty, complicated concepts in a children's movie.
 "
Frozen II,78,92,critic,"
While it's usually difficult to surpass the original, this broader, more engaging follow up to the wildly successful original speaks more to the power of togetherness than its predecessor even considered.

Pleasant and enjoyable but unlikely to leave much of a mark.
 "
Frozen II,78,92,critic,"

""Frozen II"" is sure to please the kiddies and their parents with catchy tunes and wondrous animation, even if it makes the plot more complicated than it needs to be for its target audience.

Frozen II is a solid follow up to a brilliant film, managing to surpass the original in a lot of ways, while also being weaker in many other ways.

Gemini Man,26,83,audience,"Smith's supposed to be the ultimate pro but after he finds a radio transmitter in his boat, he jumps to the ridiculous conclusion that a young female boat dock employee is a spy and is surveilling him.  He even accuses her of being a DIA spy.  So incredibly stupid I couldn't watch anymore."
Gemini Man,26,83,audience,"With the cast (Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Clive Owen) plus director Ang Lee, this film should have been much better than it was. The de-aging technology used on Will Smith looked fine, however, the CGI used for the fight and action scenes was too cartoony and took away due to it's terribly obvious computerized imagery. The story is a mess, Clive Owen is barely in it and when he is, he's given nothing of note to do. The only semi bright spot was Winstead's performance, who actually throws down a little bit (can't think of many movies she's gotten physical in)."
Gemini Man,26,83,audience,"SO GOOD. In my opinion, the plot was fabulous and the movie was executed greatly. There were so many twists and turns throughout the movie that left my eyes glued to the screen. At the end of the movie I practically had to pick my jaw up off the floor."
Gemini Man,26,83,audience,"Didn't expect much more than a boring vehicle for Will Smith's celebrity and sci fi interests. It turned out that way yet entertaining all the same.
The de-aging of Will Smith is for the most part some of the best I've ever seen."
Gemini Man,26,83,audience,"I understand why Will Smith might've thought this was a good idea, but I have no idea what is going on with Ang Lee."
Gemini Man,26,83,audience,Rating: 8/10. 80/100
Gemini Man,26,83,audience,Lots of extended chase and fight scenes fail to make a simple plot interesting. Yawn.
Gemini Man,26,83,audience,"I thought I'd eventually get around to watching this movie, thinking surely it can't be that bad? Boy,was I wrong. There are so many plot holes, contrived scenes, obvious foreshadowing - fear of bees, drowning - that I felt my brain melting away from such a dumb script. If you're going to waste this much money on a big budget film then why don't you hire a good writer for a fraction of the cost to make sure the plot works and doesn't have such awful dialogue. Really bad movie, even by Will Smith's standards."
Gemini Man,26,83,audience,"It was action packed.  Somewhat predictable, but no dull moments."
Gemini Man,26,83,audience,"Half-decent performances and Will Smith gives it a good go. A few good action scenes. Can't help but feel that something was missing, as if some plot points needed to be looked over."
Gemini Man,26,83,critic,"
Gemini Man is yet another underwhelming movie led by Smith, made doubly so because he also plays his own clone. Big ideas can sometimes get in the way of good judgment, and despite all the talent involved, hardly anything about this movie works.
 "
Gemini Man,26,83,critic,"
A 90's sci-fi action thriller that fell through a time vortex.

Gemini Man,26,83,critic,"
Smith and Winstead make an amusing team during the action scenes, but little else can be taken seriously enough for this to succeed as an A-list thriller.

Gemini Man could have been a guilty pleasure form of entertainment, but instead, it's clumsy and wooden. A waste of time for a movie fan.

You're not watching Gemini Man for its sweeping vistas of Colombia. You're watching Gemini Man to see Will Smith beat the crap out of Will Smith.

Smith has the chops to enter a new reflective phase of his career. His younger clone, however, feels oddly lifeless. ... Perhaps it would look better in the proper frame rate.

 "
Gemini Man,26,83,critic,"
Gemini Man is an action-packed and forgettable film, that allows Will Smith's talents to go to waste. The crazy thing about this movie is that I suspect it would've been so much better had it released on Netflix or some other streaming platform.
 "
Gemini Man,26,83,critic,"
Will be known for many things, including a dull, abysmal experiment that just flopped right out of the gate.
 "
Gemini Man,26,83,critic,"
""Gemini Man"" is undoubtedly a technical achievement but it clearly isn't enough to offset the movie's huge gap of weaknesses suffered from a middling script and uneven direction.
 "
Gemini Man,26,83,critic,"
The saddest thing about Gemini Man is that unlike The Tingler with its buzzing seats, ... or Avatar with its awe inspiring 3D, there is nothing that will carry on in history about this film. It exists to be forgotten.
 "
Gemini Man,26,83,critic,"
Cliched, corny and flat-out flat, Gemini Man plays out like a generic action thriller minus the action...super clumsy and chaotically unfocused...
 "
Gemini Man,26,83,critic,"
The conflict is literally both internal and external, and Lee spends just as much time with the characters in deep conversation as he does with them battling it out.

Gemini Man is a great reminder that occasionally a throwback can feel like a breath of fresh air.

Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,audience,Brilliant. Can't wait for Rambo 6!
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,audience,"I'm not sure this is how the character of Rambo should go out and I'm usually not a very big fan of the ""I told you not to do that, now you got yourself in a jam, and I've gotta fix it"" kind of movies. And really, the only violence this movie had in it was during the final showdown. We probably didn't need another Rambo and this was Stallone's attempt at parting ways with the character a la Hugh Jackman/LOGAN, but I don't see why this movie got such bad reviews. It's a decent action flick."
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,audience,Always a pleasure to watch sly in these brutal action movies ! Worth watching
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,audience,An incredible sequel that had awesome action (especially towards the epic finale) and Stallone pulling off a wonderful performance.
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,audience,"If gore was magic, Stallone was a mixture of David Copperfield, Penn and Teller.

While the movie has a boring people-story in it's first act like every Rambo movie,
the second act already compensates that while the third act is a beautiful painting of exploding heads, cut limbs and ripped out organs.

This is a men's movie at it's finest, with no excuses or compromises.
PG-13 action can get arrowed to a barn wall after you've seen this.

But let's hope this was the last time Stallone performed this role.
While he managed to pull it off once more (by the skin of his teeth) there just can't be another one."
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,audience,Best sequel yet! it was an amazing film especially to see Rambo's last mission and to see him go all out against all these people and go on a impossible super mission! Super bloody though I don't reccomend it if you get freaked out by blood and gore easily
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,audience,very bad movie and it was terible
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,audience,"Eleven years after the events in Burma, Vietnam War veteran John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) lives in Bowie, Arizona at his deceased father's horse ranch, which he manages with his old friend, Maria Beltran, and her granddaughter, Gabriela. Gabriela tells Rambo that a friend of hers, Gizelle, has found Gabriela's biological father, Manuel, in Mexico. Both Rambo and Maria tell her not to go to Mexico, but Gabriela secretly drives there to ask why Manuel abandoned her and her mother years ago. Gizelle leads Gabriela to Manuel's apartment, where he coldly tells her that he never cared for Gabriela or her mother. Gizelle takes a heartbroken Gabriela to a nearby club, where Gabriela is drugged and kidnapped by the enforcers of a Mexican cartel. Meanwhile, Maria informs Rambo of Gabriela's disappearance in Mexico. Rambo rushes to Mexico and interrogates both Manuel and Gizelle about Gabriela's whereabouts. After being threatened by Rambo, Gizelle reluctantly leads Rambo to the club where Gabriela was last seen and confronts El Flaco, the man who last spoke with Gabriela. A mysterious woman, Carmen Delgado, tails Rambo as El Flaco leads him to Gabriela's location. Rambo is immediately confronted, beaten and marked by the cartel, led by the brothers Hugo and Victor Martinez. They take his driver's license with the location of Rambo's ranch and a photo of Gabriela, whom Victor recognizes. The cartel vow to mistreat Gabriela further due to Rambo's actions...

Rotten Tomatoe critical consensus states, ""Like the sequels that preceded it, Rambo: Last Blood is content to indulge in bloody violence at the expense of its main character's once-poignant story."" The portrayal of the Rambo character was put under scrutiny. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and was complimentary of the story's ""surprisingly brooding examination"" of Rambo: ""Sure, Rambo is convincing when he ends up telling bad people, 'I'm gonna hurt you real bad,' but there is also a kind of fragility that makes us worry about people putting the hurt on him."" Peter Debruge wrote a negative review for Variety: ""This character is a mess of contradictions, representing on one hand the permanent damage that military service can do to one's soul while simultaneously suggesting what the ideal soldier looks like."" Rating the film 4.5 out of 10 for IGN, Witney Seibold lamented, ""A character who was originally meant to stand as a symbol for the damage that war can do to a soldier is now best remembered as an unkillable human machine gun"", but credited Stallone with ""[managing] to give as soulful a performance as the part warrants"". In a negative review for The Hollywood Reporter, Frank Scheck said it ""feels utterly tossed-off and generic, more resembling the pilot for a Rambo television series than a proper send off"", but credited Stallone with ""[keeping] a franchise afloat"". Critics reported being appalled by the brutality of the action scenes, with some comparing its amount of gore with that of a slasher film. Berardinelli said, ""The body count is insanely high and the methods of death are worthy of a Halloween or Friday the 13th sequel"", and gave the film 1 out of 4 stars. Debruge called the violence ""horrible, gut-wrenching carnage to witness, and yet, it's been calibrated to elicit whoops and cheers from fans, who've faithfully followed along as Rambo evolved"". Vince Mancini of Uproxx said, ""It's so genuinely horrific I'm convinced there are real-life cartel videos celebrating the torture of rivals that are less gory"", but recommended the film as a must-see. Conversely, Johnny Oleksinski of the New York Post said, ""Rambo: Last Blood features what's easily the most violent movie scene of the year. 

""Rambo - Last Blood"" makes no sense to me to be honest. Sylvester Stallone has diluted the character since ""First Blood"" and that is really the only good one in this series of 5 films. This is just more violence pornography with a weak and a bit vague storyline that we see on the screen. There´s simply not much to like."
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,audience,Worst movie I have ever seen. And that I'm big rambo series fan.
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,audience,this movie is not so bad it's just kind of boring
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,critic,"
These movies were never what you'd call clever, but was Rambo himself always this dumb?

It's definitely not intelligent, but the catastrophic machismo is mind-numbingly action-packed.

Even the racism is difficult to get too angry about because the film executes it with such a lack of awareness that it feels like a blundering pratfall.
 "
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,critic,"
After years of ridiculous sequels, Last Blood proves that Rambo has been reduced to Hollywood cannon fodder. More than disappointing, it is outright dreadful.
 "
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,critic,"
""Last Blood"" doesn't breathe new life into the series. Instead, it cheapens a once beloved character by forcing its aging action star to deliver some of the most gruesome violence ever put on screen.

Rambo: Last Blood is a brutal way to say goodbye to an iconic action hero, covering topics and containing scenes that are almost difficult to stomach.

The film's greatest sin: taking its trusting audience for granted. For a populist filmmaker like Stallone, this is a grave mistake.

Stallone brings a suitably world-weary performance to his iconic title character.
 "
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,critic,"
It's grim. It looks cheap. It's pretty much racist. It ends with slo-mo highlights from old Rambos. It's no fun whatsoever. It's as enjoyable as a trip to the dentist in a horror movie.
 "
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,critic,"
John Rambo is as American as apple pie. Actually, maybe that's too sweet a comparison. John Rambo is as American as a border wall. Yeah, that feels right.
 "
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,critic,"
The movie isn't as much fun as I was hoping for -- it's downbeat and hopeless in tone, like an action-movie King Lear without the poetry. Stallone's performance feels halfhearted; it doesn't have the exuberance of which he's capable.
 "
Rambo: Last Blood,26,82,critic,"
Sylvester Stallone's 'other' iconic character makes a final bow in this frustrating finale.

Stallone once again plays Rambo as stoic and introverted but also still physically and mentally sharp.

Midsommar,83,63,audience,"Saw it in theatres a while ago are it sure was An Experience. Wild, fun and horrifying in so many ways."
Midsommar,83,63,audience,"Midsommar is one of the best folk horror I have seen in the longest time!
The story is gripping and the characters make you feel involved from the start. I was really happy with the cast as there is some familiar faces as well as some new ones. It was well acted as a whole, most notably  Florence Pugh (Dani) her acting is - phenomenal! 
The plot idea of a modern day cult in Sweden is really interesting and continued to keep me hooked throughout. 
The imagery in particular is very punching especially the sfx and gore. Although some of the props (corpses) let me down as they were blatantly fake but nonetheless the majority were of good quality. 
Midsommar is based around this concept of brainwash, the cult members are brainwashed and so are the visiting travellers. As an audience we kind of buy into this whole idea of fantasy and fabrication of what the truth really is. We become a part of the story. 
I think it is a great movie that needs more recognition for the piece of art that it is!"
Midsommar,83,63,audience,Somebody give me back the two and half hours I spent watching this movie
Midsommar,83,63,audience,"A lot to unpack with this one. It took me some time after watching it to really absorb it. And while it's definitely original and in some parts, a little ""out there,"" I did overall enjoy it. Not as good as HEREDITARY in my opinion but a better follow-up than say Jordan Peele's US after GET OUT. This will probably not be for everybody so I'll say if you enjoyed HEREDITARY, you should enjoy this as well. And don't fear the runtime of 2 hours and 27 minutes. The story keeps you hooked throughout, wondering what'll happen next that you won't notice it."
Midsommar,83,63,audience,"great horror movie, not so much like this"
Midsommar,83,63,audience,UTTER GARBAGE AND WASTE OF TIME!!
Midsommar,83,63,audience,"I have seen several hundred movies in my lifetime and I have to say, without a shadow of a doubt that Midsomar is the absolute biggest steaming pile of shit I have ever sat through in my entire existence. Midsommar, besides its beauty, has absolutely 0 redeeming qualities. Every single aspect of the movie is simply horrendous. For starters, it is disgustingly slow. Practically nothing happens. The movie could simply last 10 minutes, and id still understand it, leaving this movie with 2h 20min of absolute garbage. Simply put, all that happens is the characters talk to the villagers then they die. Moving on to the second thing that makes this movie pitiful, is the characters. Like the movie, they are all boring and do absolutely nothing interesting the entire time. And our protagonist, Dani is the absolute worst character in film history. Annoying, needy and simply retarded. If there's any character i wanted to die, its this bitch. To put the cherry on top of this heaping pile of junk, I need to talk about the ""horror"" aspect of the movie. Calling this a horror movie is an abomination, as there are absolutely 0 scary or disturbing parts in the entire movie (my opinion). Actually, calling this a ""movie"" at all, is disrespectful to every other movie ever created. This is a ""film"" at best. Ive seen class presentations more entertaining than this vile creation. In fact, id say that this ""film"" is a weapon of torture, as i would much rather have a bullet shot through my skull than being forced to rewatch this utterly pitiful creation. If i had the chance id give this movie a 0%. And yes, I did understand the film. Dani loses her parents and sister, but nobody tries to console her, even her boyfriend practically ignores her. However, the cult treats her like family, and she finally feels accepted. THE END. Yup! That's the whole plot! SO EXCITING. RIGHT? Well your welcome, I just saved you 2h30min, now stop reading this review and go do something more productive."
Midsommar,83,63,audience,"Underdeveloped, emotionally and dramatically, and not quite weird enough to make up for it. Pugh does some effectively distraught work, and the opener genuinely upsets, in a way that the rest of the movie cannot measure up to."
Midsommar,83,63,audience,"What was THAT? Some try to fluff this film as artsy, daring, ingenious. Deeply psychological, or something.  Unlike some folks, I watched till the end to see if I could get something from it.  But the payoff never comes. No character development, no scares, just tension that doesn't pay off. The weird cult isn't even developed -- what are those people doing? Perhaps the most depressing aspect is that the little group of ""friends"" don't stick together. The weirdness and unfolding danger doesn't draw them together. There is constant jealousy, mistrust and bickering among them. I feel vicarious embarrassment for the cast, who threw dignity to the wind for this one.  11/2 stars for good cinematography and music."
Midsommar,83,63,audience,Oh my goodness that was horribly bad. Without any real tension or misdirection; you had to wonder if the outsider kids had never seen a horror flick.

Bizarre is the main course in Midsommar, which serves as Florence Pugh's tour de force. A daylight horror movie that succeeds because of the efficiency of its first act. [Full review in Spanish]

 "

A vast improvement over the wildly overrated ""Hereditary,"" director Ari Aster gives us a slow-burn of a horror film that gradually gets under the viewer's skin and proves hard to shake, even after the credits role.

Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese,92,,audience,"Its a very mediocre music documentary, maybe interesting for Dylan fans but there are really few things to make it remarkable. Seems like no one who was interview remembered the time very well and Scorsese had to use the footage to keep the boat afloat."
Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese,92,,audience,"Finally watched Rolling Thunder on Netflix last night - loved it! Favorite moment for me was a conversation just between Dylan and Joan Baez -- among myriad other wonderful moments.But this is a strange documentary....I'd like to read or hear what Scorsese says about it. I know nothing about how it came to be what it is. There isn't that much contemporary or retroactive analysis...and a goodly portion of what's there is a goof (which I hadn't read/heard about ahead of time, but caught on quickly, being knowledgeable about Dylan, and about some of the people featured in the film. The music and the footage from 1976 is well worth it tho. Especially if into Dylan. I tried to watch Renaldo and Clara twice in my lifetime and don't think ever got through it...it's really not watchable...but some of the footage from that is here. And handfuls of super cool footage--musical, audience, societal, interpersonal, and talking heads (like Sam Shepard, Allen Ginsberg)."
Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese,92,,audience,Meandering with great footage and music. 
Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese,92,,audience,"Not long after I moved from Seattle, I got a special invitation to see this film at a small screening at Tacoma's Grand Cinema. I was baffled and called up a friend of mine who also knew and worked with Stefan Van Dorp, whose footage was integral to the movie's narrative. Apparently word had gotten back to Dylan's camp (and ergo to Van Dorp) about my positive review of his album ""Shadows in the Night"" for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which explained the invitation. I found the film quite revelatory about the nuances of Dylan's mythology, and was astonished at some of the heretofore unknown events of the Rolling Thunder Revue that were, quite honestly, unbelievable. I don't want to spoil any of it for you here, but I imagine I might have to address some of it in my liner notes to Dylan's upcoming boxed set, ""The Bootleg Series: One Night in Boise, 1972,"" an as-yet-unheard solo performance of songs that weren't good enough for inclusion on ""Self-Portrait."""

Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,audience,"Fans of the series will not be disappointed by Deadwood: The Movie. Every returning character's representation is written thoughtfully, meaningfully, and provides a sense of finality that the series finale was lacking. Characters, and Deadwood itself, changed enough in the intermittent times to make a revisit worth the trip. However, the plot here is familiar enough; the conflict is essentially nearly identical to the storyline of Season 3, but with more gunplay and the stakes heightened. Fans will be glad to know that this time there is a finality and a proper sendoff to a charismatic western period piece."

Milch gave me exactly what I needed to wipe my face from the spit left there by the season 3, and for a long time, the show's finale.  A great reunion with characters I love and business finished.  I suppose one can pick apart certain aspects of the story, but I think they are missing what this was about.  It was a love letter from Milch and the cast to the fans.  A walk down memory lane to a satisfying conclusion.  It feels like some people can't appreciate a show or movie anymore unless it is dark, or the ending leaves the audience broken or debating what happened. My only disappointment is they couldn't figure in a 3rd character for Garret Dillahunt to play."
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,audience,"It was like being invited to a party with old friends that you hadn't seen for such a stretch, you hadn't realized until this night how much you miss them. Probably the only really successful series reunion show I've ever seen. Good plot, brilliant dialogue and great characters. It was so much better than most of what I've been streaming lately."
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,audience,Finally the series gets the ending it deserves. Faithfully to the shows original framework which all of the main characters given a suitable chance to shine!
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
The Deadwood movie is a deeply-satisfying and tightly-written coda to one of the best TV series ever.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
[I]f the worst one can say is that the Deadwood movie feels more like an encore than a send-off, that's far from the worst position to be in.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
It's a story for the ages and one that finally gets the fitting ending it deserves.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
[David] Milch's gift for raw frontier poetry, with Shakespearean soliloquies filtered through X-rated doggerel, is as entertaining as ever in a violent yet appropriately elegiac (and oh-so-satisfying) two-hour farewell.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
The term ""fan service"" is often used as a cudgel against artists who may or may not be pandering to their loyal audiences, but the Deadwood movie feels like an ideal version of that concept.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
The flowing, often downright poetic dialogue still rolls off the screen and into your ears like beautifully profane music.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
As complete and final as the story may rest on its conclusion, one can't help but yearn for more.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
[David] Milch's writing magnificently blends the high and the low, with old-world phraseology punctuated with great stinging bursts of vulgarity.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
This is a finely wrought return to a modern Golden Age TV classic, which more than makes up for its lack of surprises with the almost tender treatment of its characters, and dialogue that's written to be relished.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
With [David] Milch's words... [Ian] MacShane still raises f'ing and blinding to a poetic art.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
""Deadwood"" movie is a pleasing reunion, giving the characters and Milch the kind of ending this groundbreaking series always deserved.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
A nostalgic and bittersweet end.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
Though the movie does not have the same depth as the three-season series, it offers some new insights on the motley band of humans... who are trying to do right by each other in the face of monopoly capitalism and a political system ruled by the wealthy..
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
Deadwood: The Movie is a perfect ending for a show that explored early and often the redemptive nature of second chances, and if this is creator David Milch's legacy, it is a flawless one.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
This film remains a fitting and satisfying farewell.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
Deadwood: The Movie is true to the show's original spirit and is as satisfying a conclusion as could be hoped for.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
Deadwood is a story, not of this century, but also not quite out of the past.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
Ironically, for a series in which so many the characters were motivated by selfishness, ambition, greed or unadulterated wickedness, this was a surprisingly warm, almost sentimental finale.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
We've had our chance to view the resurrection and synthesis of Milch's genius, and once again Al's words are left ringing in our ears. Last time it was don't go, this time it's rest easy.
 "
Deadwood: The Movie,98,84,critic,"
By the standards of Deadwood itself, the movie may not add much to the conversation. But by the standards of a revival, it's done exactly what it should.
 "
Ma,56,64,audience,"Predictable but still satisfying. Bullying can have lasting effects, Ma was deranged because of her highschool experience and this was handled quickly, as to fit with genre and time constraints. The apprehension and build-ups to her actions were good (for what it was) I didn't hate it.  It's not going to win any thought-provoking awards but it was entertaining enough and left the viewer with the notion not everything is straight forward, there are backstories to protagonists and villains."
Ma,56,64,audience,"Octavia Spencer gives a creepy and enjoyable performance but other than her, this movie is very bland. Storyline is pretty weak and I kept waiting for something to happen and it doesn't really until the last 15 minutes or so of the film. More of a suspense than horror film."
Ma,56,64,audience,"It was okay, but one thing that annoys me is illogical stuff with bondage. You know how someone's a hostage with their hands tied in front and gagged? They have free hands but don't remove the gag and scream for help. Same logic as having a leash around your neck with a latch and your hands are free and you leave it on. That's LAZY directing or writing to me. Use your head people."
Ma,56,64,audience,Not scary in the slightest but Octavia Spencer was fantastic!
Ma,56,64,audience,"This was the 10th movie I saw with Octavia in it and so far the only one where her role is particularly prominent, so I was looking forward to seeing it and thought her performance was excellent. Some of the teenagers did a good job too, and the premise was very good. The problem was the very jilted pacing with her whipping out a gun in the first act of the movie and then very little happening until the end. I also had the impression that some of the scenes weren't very well-rehearsed or they used a take in the final cut that wasn't very good, particularly Juliette's scenes (Maggie's mom) as she came off uncomfortable and robotic sometimes despite being a good actress, likely in part due to the director's friendship with the two Oscar-winning actresses as they both did very well and likely had the comfort level necessary to put out good takes quickly, establishing an atmosphere of not doing the amount of prep work that would've allowed the rest of the cast to keep up with them. Still, I didn't agree with other opinions that they mishandled the premise as giving the backstory they did was an effective way to show Ma's origin story as a crazy person. Blumhouse movies are never perfect and rarely great, but I felt this one was very good."
Ma,56,64,audience,"The story is full of holes, like most movies today. I love Octavia Spencer but this role could have been played by any B actor. I don't want to give too much away, but teenage kids would have fought harder, and I think they would have been smart enough to unhook themselves from a dog collar. Unfortunately, it seems as though writers these days have an idea for a storyline, but lose their train of thought when it comes to the ending."
Ma,56,64,audience,They really thought it was OK to have the imagery of a white woman standing a black woman in the back? Lowest of low.
Ma,56,64,audience,This movie was pretty underwhelming. Very disturbing honestly. It really just feels like a movie that was thought up in 5 days.
Ma,56,64,audience,"Octavia Spencer is a great actress, I saw the movie recently and I was entertained it is a small movie but with her resources they did a lot."
Ma,56,64,audience,Nothing special about this movie
Ma,56,64,critic,"
[Ma is] an antihero of the highest caliber...The catharsis was glorious.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
Though ""Ma"" is a tad uneven, the movie crackles with uneasy electricity anytime Spencer graces the screen.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
Taylor aspires for camp and while the script doesn't fully deliver, Spencer absolutely does. She gives the film an energy that Scotty Landes' screenplay is somewhat lacking.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
Though the film contains a timely theme (the long-term effects of bullying), there's something missing from the latest from Blumhouse Pictures.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
As a result of its staunch yet muddled writing, Ma ends up being a serviceable camp thriller with a tremendous Octavia Spencer performance.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
One of the most unique, inspired horror movie villains to come across the big screen in quite some time.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
If you like your horror campy and funny with a devilishly nasty edge, then Ma will most certainly take care of you.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
Where Landes sees satire, Taylor sees trauma. Where Landes sees a sick joke, Taylor sees a sickness.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
Ma is gloriously trashy, with the right amount of camp fun, creepiness and comedic absurdity.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
We gradually learn more about Ma's backstory, and the only real twist is how mundane it all is.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
It was good. I'd recommend it.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
Super campy, over the top, fun.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
Octavia Spencer delivers an unnerving, daring performance...but this is stupid.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
Spencer is the reason to see this movie, no question.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
[T]he film is mostly comedic for the first half hour of the film, but once the scary side of Ma comes out, it builds with a steady escalation.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
A 'friday night movie' that stays in the safe zone. Spencer shines as usual. [Full review in Spanish].
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
The movie itself is fairly ordinary... [But] when [Octavia Spencer] goes bananas, she pulls the rip-cord. She has all kinds of fun.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
[T]he film never really finds its footing.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
Even though Ma could've been more from a social commentary perspective, I still enjoyed it both as a hoot of a pulpy thriller and as a fascinating racial case study that's ultimately as much about its interpretation as its intent.
 "
Ma,56,64,critic,"
""Ma"" is poorly written, but Spencer lifts it up by making her crazy lady character at least a little understandable.

Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,audience,"The first live action adaptation of the most popular franchise ever is shockingly good, great acting, a not too cliche story, and Ryan reynolds"

Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,audience,"This movie is better than I expected it to be, honestly if you enjoyed the Sonic movie, you may just enjoy this one too."
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,audience,"Todos os pokemon no filme ficaram encantadores, mesmo realistas eles ficam muito mais belos e alguns até mais fofos.

Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,audience,Pikachu's greatest movie!!!!!!!!
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
Kids who don't know any better will probably like it; the parents who are stuck taking them are in for a slog.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
Pokémon Detective Pikachu has a purpose - to indulge fans - and it does so with gusto. Anyone else would be better served by choosing almost any other movie.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
An emphasis on spectacle rather than charm and story.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
Like its live action-animation hybrid predecessors, Pokémon: Detective Pikachu has the distinct smell of a cult classic.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
Pokemon Detective Pikachu might not do the human characters justice, but it absolutely nails all the Pokemon.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
It's a delight for fans to see how immersive this world actually feels.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
Pokemon fans will be delighted at the visual interpretations of a beloved franchise, but the pervasive mildness of it all makes for an easily forgettable production.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
Detective Pikachu is actually a good kids movie, both succeeding at entertaining kids and giving them a good life lesson while entertaining any adults watching as well.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
It's a movie so strange that Rita Ora popping up in a bizarre cameo as a scientist wouldn't even crack a list of the top ten weirdest things about it.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
The makers of Pokémon: Detective Pikachu have done something wise, which is to create a film version of the media/toy franchise that is mostly accessible even to those of us who have zero connection to the phenomenon that is Pokémon.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
[T]he experience isn't so much linear as it is downright circuitous, stranding its nuggets of fuzzy joy in a script that fails to blend world-building with forward momentum.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
I am extremely bored by this Rob Letterman Pokémon film adapted by the 'Detective Pikachu' video game. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
Pays service to the Pokémon fan base but it's Ryan Reynolds Pikachu that injects the fun.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
Detective Pikachu relies so heavily on fan recognition that it doesn't take enough time to flesh out the plot or make their characters people we want stick around with.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
Pokémon Detective Pikachu is incredibly nutty, a bit bonkers and all kinds of fun, even for someone like me with no connection to its base entertainment universe.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
I can't remember the last time I was so disinterested in a film.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
This movie was a waste of time.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
This is a film rooted in a ludicrous concept that doesn't just work, but excels because of the amount of heart that has gone into making it. It's earnest, endearing, and well worth a Pika.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
It's just nice, it's a nice pleasant thing. I think if you yourself have Pokemon nostalgia you'll probably get some enjoyment out of this, just don't expect to be surprised by the plot.
 "
Pokémon Detective Pikachu,67,79,critic,"
Detective Pikachu is a fun family movie that can be enjoyed by many. It's a love letter to the world of Pokémon and easily the best video game movie made.

Knock Down the House,99,10,audience,A fascinating and emotionally moving documentary that highlights the highs and lows of grassroots campaigns across the country. I loved learning about the motivation that drives the incredible women featured and the passion they take into their respective races.
Knock Down the House,99,10,audience,"Yikes, that was bad but what do you expect considering the abysmal protagonist lmao AOC is as brainy as an empty bucket."
Knock Down the House,99,10,audience,"LOL at all the Republicans who conspired to give Knock Down The House a low audience score, but as a non-US observer, this documentary was entertaining and emotionally powerful.  The critics were right that this is 99% certified fresh."
Knock Down the House,99,10,audience,"Excellent documentary of a few everyday women who chose to run for office and make a change in our country. It can be done, regardless of political affiliation. It will be the young people who will make the changes needed to get our country back on track. Keep going, keep trying. As my daughter says, all the old white men need to move out of the way."
Knock Down the House,99,10,audience,"This documentary is empowering. Gen Z will change the world, and we need more of these types of documentaries."
Knock Down the House,99,10,audience,"I just watched this in summer 2020, after all we've been through for the past three years. Gives me hope for the future of this country."
Knock Down the House,99,10,audience,"I love the grit and passion shown by these women through this movie/documentary!  Knock Down the House is a must-see for anyone aspiring to change our society for the better and how to persevere through the process (locally, nationally, globally, and in any field including politics)!  Women, stand up and take up space -- more than ever before!"
Knock Down the House,99,10,audience,Inspiring politician with absolutely clear motives to change life for the better! 
Knock Down the House,99,10,audience,"I loved this documentary! I couldn't help but cry and feel the kind of hope for a better future. I just heard that Paula Jean Swearengin won her primary just recently! 
I was on the edge of my seat and I learned so many things about the inter-workings of how to get into office. This inspired me to start phone banking and I didn't know I had it in me to talk to strangers for hours, but when you have hope for a better world you can do amazing things, just like these ladies."
Knock Down the House,99,10,audience,Rather revealing. And inspiring.
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
...one of the greatest political underdog stories seen on screen.

Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
If only the film had expanded this focus [on AOC] to include the nexus of all four women.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
Robin Blotnick's editing bobs and weaves between their personal and professional lives, refusing to stuff them into any gendered, ethnic, or social boxes.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
An average documentary that will inspire, anger, and perhaps even motivate viewers to change the world.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
Lears makes efficient use of time, diving just enough into the lives of the candidates to understand where they're coming from, but not making them come across so weepy as to be ineffectual.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
It's impossible not to find yourself cheering and feeling a lump in your throat at this David versus Goliath story. But also find your heart breaking with the tears of loss of those other candidates who were less fortunate.

Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
They're Democrats, but the movie should be inspiring to anyone who wishes to see firsthand the immeasurable value of good retail politics and hard work.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
Regardless of one's partisan leanings, it's hard to resist the dramatic momentum of these intertwined narratives.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
It's incredible how [Rachel] Lears captured AOC's improbable ascent, and for that reason alone people will get a kick out of this film.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
[Rachel] Lears mixes [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez's rise with the campaigns of three other Brand New Congress candidates around the country. And they're sometimes more compelling than the future congresswoman.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
If anything, filmmakers could have spent more time with these organizations... Instead, one gets the sense [Rachel] Lears, like the viewer, was swept up into capturing Ocasio-Cortez' near mythic rise.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
If the storytelling is a bit uneven, the story itself more than makes for it.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
I cheered. You will, too.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
Although Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the ""star"" of Knock Down the House, the movie is at its best when it shows the hard work of community organizing.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
It's a friendly record of an extraordinary moment.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
Everyone likes an underdog story, and when the underdog is as eloquent, passionate and righteous as these four women are, the final reels of this film feel like a Rocky movie.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
I found myself in awe of the courage these candidates had to put their name out there, and [Rachel] Lears is right there with them as they pound the pavement, knock on doors, and fight for the causes that got them off their butts in the first place.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
The inspiring documentary Knock Down the House shows the rise of AOC and three other progressive women who emerged after the 2016 elections.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
The sort of inspiring, invigorating film that will remind those in the existential funk created by all things Trump-related that there is hope.
 "
Knock Down the House,99,10,critic,"
[It proves] a bit superficial [since it's] less about what standing up entails than the circumstances that got them to stand in the first place. [But it's] interesting enough.
 "
The Hottest August,85,,critic,"
Story, perhaps better known outside Canada for her stylistically distinctive work, has been compared to Errol Morris, but that's a tad unfair. She's a true original and this film is formidably rich in texture.
 "
The Hottest August,85,,critic,"
A free-flowing and discursive essay about the future which already feels like a postcard from the past.
 "
The Hottest August,85,,critic,"
Derek Howard's cinematography highlights the mundane beauty... Troy Herion's score adds an atmospheric but unobtrusive element.
 "

I can't think of anyone better suited to capture the poetry of our despair.
 "
The Hottest August,85,,critic,"
Is the future controllable, inevitable, or both? Are we preparing for it, or will it eat us whole like the moon ate the sun that August?
 "
The Hottest August,85,,critic,"
The film becomes a sophisticated exercise in science horror. There's an intricate sensory layer to the storytelling that evokes the rainy summer and its flitting breezes, a creeping shadow of the uncanny cast over its beauty.
 "
The Hottest August,85,,critic,"
August 2017 was not the hottest on record. Not even close. If one can't get the title right, what chance is there of everything else falling into order?
 "
The Hottest August,85,,critic,"
...far from An Inconvenient Truth, and other activism or information-centric documentaries of its ilk...the subjects in the film are offering their own perspective in words, not in facts and figures.

Attempting to make the abyss legible, The Hottest August might be the most devastating film ever made.
 "
The Hottest August,85,,critic,"
No movie can encompass everything that's on the minds of Americans at the moment, but Story's modest but wide-ranging cine-essay comes closest, constructed in such a way that no two audiences will see it the same way.

The Hottest August,85,,critic,"
The film is beautifully lensed by Derek Howard, capturing distinct qualities in natural light, in the quantity of water in the air, which speak to its subject.
 "

But sometimes an experiment feels like just an experiment, and that's where the well-intentioned query ""The Hottest August"" ultimately lands.

This collection of interactions with ordinary people is a cinematic gift both simple and multilayered, an intellectual challenge and an emotional adventure.

The Hottest August isn't a chore by any means but has trouble balancing its tone.

The Hottest August confronts the urban, cosmopolitan, festival-going audience that will inevitably comprise its first (and hopefully not last) wave of reception with its own mirror image...
 "

The film drifts subtly from subject to subject, pointedly using B roll not just to provide a sense of place, which it does evocatively, but to extend someone's thought or offer counterpoint.

Alita: Battle Angel,61,92,audience,"The CGI is the only thing that took the half star off for me and even then, it was flawless and pretty accurate to the original manga in the terms of style of how Alita looked.

It was, overall, a great story. Best anime/manga to movie adaptation ever made."
Alita: Battle Angel,61,92,audience,"From the previews, I was looking forward to this. Visually it's beautiful, but that's about it. The story and the world they created I just couldn't get myself in to and quite frankly, I was a little bored with it about midway through. A waste of talent including both Mahershala Ali and Jennifer Connelly (both of whom I'm a fan of) seemed robotic themselves with their performances. Christoph Waltz is his usually charming self and he's enjoyable, as it Rosa Salazar who plays Alita. Overall, disappointing."
Alita: Battle Angel,61,92,audience,Movie's better then the amine love it
Alita: Battle Angel,61,92,audience,Movie was ok. I enjoyed it.
Alita: Battle Angel,61,92,audience,"I'm a fan - straight up. There's a build up in tension as the story develops, and as Alita develops and realises who she is. The 'Bad guy' needs some work, but the action scenes are off the charts. Great show, great story that deserves to be developed further!"
Alita: Battle Angel,61,92,audience,Great for lovers of sci - fi

Alita: Battle Angel,61,92,critic,"
Against all odds, Alita actually works. While previous live-action manga adaptations like Death Note and Ghost in the Shell came out bloated and disingenuous, Alita: Battle Angel is fun, fiery and focused enough to know what it's about.

Movie fans can only dream what it would have been like had James Cameron decided to fully devote himself to the creation of Alita: Battle Angel.

Alita: Battle Angel is a tonally chaotic mess.

Alita's problems overflow when the action tapers, and a lot of this has to do with Rodriguez's direction. He can't sustain interest in quieter moments.

 "
Alita: Battle Angel,61,92,critic,"
he film's reverent approach to the source material, warts and all, is simultaneously the film's biggest strength and weakness, but its otherworldly visuals are a worthy spectacle that need to be seen on IMAX or 3D if possible.

Alita belongs in the pantheon of great visual spectacle, gonzo sci-fi cult movies with The Fifth Element, Dark City and Speed Racer.

Yes, I am giving Alita: Battle Angel one of my stingy 10's out of a possible 10. Imaginative, true to the artists' concepts, and an all-out cinematic action blast.

Ghost in the Shell covered similar thematic territory, but Alita is superior in every way.

Overall, Alita: Battle Angel looks great but the overly sentimental script and uneven character development come across as a rushed mess.

It's sort of overlong and overstuffed, but Rosa Salazar is quite good.

The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part,84,68,audience,"While not as good as the original, the pieces still click together."
The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part,84,68,audience,"The vast majority was disappointingly bland, I was looking at the clock after only 15 minutes of watching. 

The movie starts without a proper build-up, and the story is a jumbled mess of siblings randomly forcing their own story progression. Not until the movie has nearly ended does it come together and did I feel somewhat entertained.
The jokes aren't clever enough to keep your attention, except for maybe 2, and the songs feel unnecessary. The one that claims it'll get stuck in your head was ironically not that catchy, while those performed by the villain were the most fun. The previous movie's ""Everything is Awesome"" is painfully overused in the form of renditions and quotes. I think the sad version should've been the only reference, and the record album Emmet was gifted an Easter egg.

The twist was a lazy attempt at making the villains misunderstood, it didn't add up, but the worst offender was the Rex character. I must've missed some dialogue, because I have no idea why he's so Hell-bent on making Emmet become like him and thus ensuring his own suffering. Wouldn't you rather make sure the past never happened the way it did?

Anyway. That's it, that's my review, goodbye."

Duration/Tempo: (3/5) At 1 hour and 47 minutes, it's an average length movie that felt about the same.  Too long.  Would have liked to see 15 minutes trimmed from the film's length.

Cast & Crew: (3/5) Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks were OK, but not as good as in the original.  The cast in general were solid, but their performance suffered due to the weak story.

Summary: (3/5) The story and cast were middling, and the film didn't move as quickly as I would have liked.  A thumbs down."

"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",54,57,audience,"The first half was too rushed, but the second half captured the courtroom madness quite well. There should have been some murder and action rather than just Ted driving around. Furthermore, the film was too focused on his relationship with his wife and then his prison girlfriend instead of his crimes. The prison escape portions were enjoyable, but in reality, he had to lose a lot of weight to fit through the ceiling. Otherwise, it seemed quite accurate. However, I think the use of real footage could have been done better in places or avoided completely. Zac Efron put on a decent performance, and the rest of the cast wasn't bad. The cinematography, visual effects, and soundtrack were all fine. Another case of writing letting a film down."
"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",54,57,audience,"It's a film that is elevated by strong performances from Zac Efron and Lily Collins. 
However, it takes a number of liberties with the facts in an attempt to create reasonable doubt in the mind of the audience leading to a 'big payoff' admission of guilt at the end. Strangely, this decision made him more palatable and sanitized. The performances and screenplay are good enough to be captivating but the creative license taken is likely to disappoint Bundy aficionados and those familiar with the crimes."
"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",54,57,audience,"This film released in 2019 and which tells the story of a single mother (Liz) who falls in love with a serial killer (Ted Bundy) contains an excellent combination between blind love and how macabre this guy was. He shows us the point of view of his girlfriend, who did not find anything wrong with him, and it is something that can also happen to us when we see her, the excellent performance of Zac Efron and the approach they gave to the plot that allows us to see a murderous monster from his most human side, this is the better, when you start watching this movie you may think it contains a lot of blood, but it actually shows in scenes very similar to real life how ted bundy behaved."
"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",54,57,audience,"In hindsight, the film is a slow paced drama that I normally would not fault you for losing interest in so quickly.  Having said that, ""Extemely Wicked, Shockingly Evil And Vile"" is carried solely on the performance of Zach Efron's ""Ted Bundy"".  We never see any of the murders conducted by Bundy on film, instead we are treated to Bundy the ""person"".  I believe this made it such an unenviable task to portray such an individual, one that we know to be anything but ""human"".  Efron's performance as Bundy was absolutely brilliant, cold and unsettling.  Efron's performance alone makes it easy to overlook any shortcomings that the film may have.  Solely for Efron's performance, I highly recommend making time to view this film."
"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",54,57,audience,"I watched the movie right after watching the documentary featuring real news clips with Ted Bundy, and all I could see were the inconsistencies. He was diagnosed as a psychopath and he said himself that he lacked empathy and emotion - yet he cries in the movie..
When he is publicly charged the deputy seemed frustrated and uncomfortable in the movie whereas he in reality kept his cool and continued reciting..
I found myself rolling my eyes several times during the movie due to incorrect information.."

"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",54,57,audience,"I can see that they were looking for a charming actor and he definitely full filled that part of the character but that is it. His acting was really poor, the role required him to lose weight  (he didn't ), to look evil (he never did),  the script was rushed and the mix with original footage wasn't well put together. If this film had a bigger budget and time...I can just picture Joaquin Phoenix dong a great job."

"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",54,57,audience,Zach Efron is good in his role but this movie has a weird pace and really glorifies bundy for like 90% of the movie. Bundy eventually shows his true colors but the payoff really doesn't do it after building this guy up for two hours.

Efron makes for a disarming and terrifying Ted Bundy, but the film doesn't seem to know whose point of view it wants to take.

Irma La Douce,76,79,audience,This was a very funny movie and the performance of the actors was brilliant
Irma La Douce,76,79,audience,The people involved seem to be running away from the story they are trying to tell.
Irma La Douce,76,79,audience,"Maclaine's naivety toward her profession is quite charming , ' I once knew a gentleman and all he'd do is scatter some marbles on the floor and make me pick them up with my toes'. Lemmon's English gent is funny. The fraternity of pimps is quite uncomfortable (in a comedy). Lou Jacoby is great in every scene. Worth a watch although a little long."
Irma La Douce,76,79,audience,"Wow, the technicolor in this movie looks amazing. All the colors pop. Especially that light green text for the opening credits. Shirley's looking great. Real cute. And that dog is hilarious. Wilder took some beautiful shots of Paris with the sunrise and the day beginning in the food market. For being such a serious topic, the light hearted feel and charming personalities make for a very comedic and entertaining watch. 

Leave it to Billy Wilder to make a movie about a prostitute and an ex policeman turned pimp who fall for each other and then on top of that make it sweet and endearing. Incredible feat. This is what happens when you write a tremendous screenplay and have an amazing director. 

When Jack Lemmon turns into the Englishman - that was hilarious! I love Moustache's character. He's a real one, someone you'd want around when things go south. When he comes out of the closet wearing the policeman uniform. That was so fucking clever, I wasn't even expecting that!

This was a wonderful movie filled with heartfelt and endearing moments and best of all, it didn't have to do it by getting overly sappy or cheesy. Billy Wilder is a genius. He wrote it, produced it and directed it, of course with help from his production team and co-writers. This movie solidified my love for Wilder's movies and I can say he is one of my favorite directors. Terrific movie!"
Irma La Douce,76,79,audience,"Way overlong, but a delightful vision of lurid romantic Paris, and incredible MacLaine and Lemmon. Billy Wilder pushing the limits not entirely successful, but who cares? Enjoy!"
Irma La Douce,76,79,audience,The best comedy movie ever made!
Irma La Douce,76,79,audience,"Wilder, Lemmon and MacLaine team up again after their collaboration in The Apartment to offer us a funny and audacious farce that works well enough despite being a bit overlong and clumsy in parts, especially as it becomes more and more contrived towards the end."
Irma La Douce,76,79,audience,"""the apartment"" with a bigger budget and less of a point, Wilder reteams lemmon and Maclaine in essentially the same roles, under different, lighter circumstances and a Parisian locale. it's not bad, per se, only light entertainment. Network television used to run the film every year."
Irma La Douce,76,79,audience,"Well paced despite its long running time. It's not Wilder's wisest, sharpest or most cynical. But it's Wilder nonetheless and there's plenty to enjoy!"

Billy Wilder is a great director and you can't find too many actress es better than Shirley MacLaine, so when Jack Lemmon appears on the screen, the triple-treat is complete.
 "

Minding the Gap,100,92,audience,What a devastating movie..... cool skateboard footage too.
Minding the Gap,100,92,audience,"The polarity of skateboarding is this  - It can be the best feeling, like being free beyond freedom but it can go wrong very quickly. In some ways and for many its a form of self harm because pain is an inevitable part of it. Now take childhood and apply the same thinking. That's the gap and the bridge for me.

Very moving"
Minding the Gap,100,92,audience,"This film gives you perspective on an unfortunately common challenge faced by many people. It does it with heart and soul — and skateboards. I'm not crying, you're crying. Beautiful — I really loved this one. Watch it."

Minding the Gap,100,92,audience,"Great skateboarding footage, but the story skins the surface too much "
Minding the Gap,100,92,audience,"One of the most deeply moving documentaries I've ever seen. A genuine exploration of life, luck (or lack thereof), friendship, abuse, hope, loss, circumstance, family, parenting, and the devastating effects of inaction and a prolonged lack of direction or responsibility. Every single main character in this movie has had fatherhood profoundly impact their life. I turned this on thinking it was just a skateboarding doc and in one of the last scenes I cried...hard with one of the main characters. Just a fucking incredible movie that forces you to examine whether you deserve the credit you give yourself for your own life and ask yourself whether you'd be anywhere near where you are had you been born into one of the situations shared in this unbelievably intimate film. In my heart I can't be more genuine in saying that I hope every one of the kids in this movie is finding their way and thriving. And if they haven't yet...that they don't give up."
Minding the Gap,100,92,audience,"I was surprised, impressed and touched by the raw and unrelentingly honest approach of this documentary.

Welcome to Marwen,34,48,audience,Five minutes in and I knew what I was in for. Dull. Zemeckis should stop with the fantasies.
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,audience,"Never seen the movie, but I think it looks terrible in my opinion."
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,audience,"Mark Hogancamp was a talented comic book artist until a devastating attack left him unable to draw, with severe memory loss and somewhat of a recluse.  His lawyer and friends are all hoping he will testify at the trial of the men who attacked him but while still experiencing crippling and fearful flashbacks of the attack he instead chooses to lose himself in a new form of artistic expression in which he brings a whole new world to life through photography and so continues to live his life through the imaginary world of his subjects.
Welcome to Marwen is an interesting film, it's a sad true life tale but at the same time it perhaps fails to elicit an appropriate amount of sympathy for the central character because post attack, his new form of art, although beautifully photographed does perhaps come across as a little creepy at times.  His female characters within his imaginary world are straight out of a Tarantino screenplay and although they're fun characters, it just didn't quite seem to fit into the mix.  Visually the film looks great as these imaginary dolls are brought to life in war torn Belgium and the photographer Hogancamp obviously had a keen and talented eye for photographic pulp story telling. Overall though, it didn't come across as quaint or cute which was maybe the intention.  It was decent enough but was missing something to give it a likeable quality"
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,audience,"Il vero difetto del film è il mancato sviluppo delle sue potenzialità. Lo scambio ideologico tra realtà e fantasia funziona decentemente, forse con il freno a mano tirato. E' la parte più interessante del film ed esplora concetti già descritti in alcuni tra i migliori film in circolazione, ma in questo caso si apre un cerchio che poi non viene mai chiuso. Niente di clamorosamente mediocre come viene descritto nei vari siti di critica, anche se il difetto lo può percepire anche lo spettatore più distratto. Visivamente molto appagante, soprattutto nelle scene con le bambole, davvero un aspetto innovativo che conferma ancora una volta che il vero problema del film risiede proprio nella sceneggiatura."
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,audience,"I couldn't quite make out what was going on with this one as it felt like a very strange, bizarro version of The Lego Movie but with Barbie dolls and instead of a kid ""directing"" the scenes it's a middle aged man with PTSD. This rating is mostly for Steve Carell's performance in the lead role because it's definitely Oscar worthy."
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,audience,"Loved this movie! Didn't know the story before and now want to go to New York and see the actual place. A beautiful, compelling, emotional, funny story about a tragic incident which completely changed one mans life overnight. I instantly warmed to the main characters, and felt the onscreen chemistry between them all was just beautiful. The cinematography was wonderful, making me laugh, cry, jump, and keeping my interest the whole time. Well worth watching."
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,audience,"In a word: nice. Made me want to visit Marwencol. Some genuine laughs and great effects. Memorable score as well. The story is compelling because it's true. But the slow pace and 2-D characters surrounding the protagonist left me disappointed. Worth a watch, especially if you like bad-ass WW2 dolls in heels."
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,audience,Very engaging character analysis and background. A really interesting plot magically educated.
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,audience,"I know there's a powerful and moving story in the background, but it ultimately gets lost behind the sensory overload at times ( maybe that's the point, although I doubt it ). Monae I have no time for, she's a ham and not a very fine one. Carell really seems to be struggling for ""vehicles"" these days. Haven't seen him in anything of note since Foxcatcher ?"
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,audience,Loved this film. Was a great story which had me intrigued from start to end!
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
Presented to critics as a potential awards contender early in awards season, the awards season buzz quickly died down.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
The film never realizes it, but Mark is depicted as a total creep, and . . . Welcome to Marwen explores trauma and gender identity with the tact of a plane crash.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
The Zemeckis movie, based on a true story, is a little condescending with the protagonist who fits very well in Steve Carell's shoes, but lacks substance. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
Oddly enough, the true story that this film is based on is anything but bland, but somehow the Hollywoodization of it (complete with additional explosions) feels sleepy and uninspired.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
It desperately wants to be a film about resilience, recovery, and redemption. Instead, it ends up being a serious absurdity of epic proportions, that is as plastic and hollow as the dolls who reside within it.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
Welcome to Marwen is a disjointed yet well-meaning movie, although you'd most likely be better served finding the original documentary.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
The biggest asset is Carell, whose heartbreaking portrayal of the lonely, traumatized artist is just what fans of Marwencol would hope for.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
Despite the movie juggling too much, the doll sequences are beautiful, featuring characters that manage to be expressive despite their shiny plastic bodies.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
A very good film marked with enough humor to keep the audience from succumbing to the subject matter tackled in the film.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
I didn't find it creepy -- maybe I'm just creepy!
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
There's a good message wrapped around this imaginative, creative, well-structured fairy tale that deals with hate crimes against gays, and women. Hogy and his dames may be plastic, but this movie does show some heart.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
While a sometimes challenging watch, it's certainly an absorbing one.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
Zemeckis fails to imbue this biographical film with believable human emotion.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
Welcome to Marwen doesn't grab you from the start but the story of Marc Hogancamp and his injury is fascinating.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
sure to remain one of the most bizarre films of 2019
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
Zemeckis leaves little screen time for the protagonist's recovery, so the final confrontation seems added as an afterthought.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
Welcome to Marwen is something else, but what is it? ""The calamity of movie history is not the follies that get made but the follies that don't get made,"" Pauline Kael wrote.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
Welcome to Marwen retains a certain power, which comes from both the documentary on which it is based, and on Zemeckis's desire to make a career-enfolding late work so he could bare his soul.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
An insulting and dehumanizing nightmare that doubles as a truly bizarre look into the director's own creative process.
 "
Welcome to Marwen,34,48,critic,"
Welcome to Marwen, though highly imperfect, is the film of an immoderate, quixotic commercial artist, full of risk and failure, with a tin-ear to what constitutes popular appeal, and shot through with passages of perplexing power and grace.

The Greatest Showman,57,86,audience,"Such a great, fun, feel-good movie! I really enjoyed it - listen to the audience ratings, not the critic reviews! don't expect historical accuracy, but definitely expect a good time, heartfelt music and amazing performances!"
The Greatest Showman,57,86,audience,"Contrived and mawkish, with atrocious songs."
The Greatest Showman,57,86,audience,"The Greatest Showman is a musical drama released in 2017. 
The story sets in 19th century USA, the protagonist Phineas T. Barnum is the son of a humble tailor that dreams to be accepted by aristocratic society and a successful showman. Phineas knows that his entertainment skills are not enough to attract the public so he calls to perform in his show people with different (weird) physical characteristics, Phineas, aided by Phillip Carlyle, will succeed but the glory will make him lose sight of his values. At the end, thanks to his family and friends, he will understand what are the real important thing in his life. 
Written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and directed by Michael Gracey, this movie presents a famous and excellent cast with the main characters interpreted by Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson and Zendaya that in addiction to being professional actors, they are all talented singers.
The strong point of this movie is definitely the wonderful songs, became very popular, also among who doesn't know the musical.
The movie inspired by the story of P. T. Barnum's creation of Barnum's American Museum, hides a deeper message of inclusion and non-discrimination.
In the last years, the greatest showman won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for the song ""This Is Me"", was nominated for Best Original Song at the 90th Academy Awards and won the Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.
In conclusion, I recommend this musical drama to people of all ages that love the genre."
The Greatest Showman,57,86,audience,"Far from resembling a classic musical, The Greatest Showman serves as a one-time, moderately entertaining film. Importing pop-style music into a period piece rarely works and doesn't here."
The Greatest Showman,57,86,audience,"This movie was extraordinary. The cast is very talented, the songs are awesome, the colors are beautiful, and the screenplay is very good. The story is catchy same as the songs, and you care about the characters. I highly recommend this film, you won't regret watching it. One of my favorite movies of all time."
The Greatest Showman,57,86,audience,The Greatest Showman is my all-time favorite musical besides Hamilton. Zac Efron did an amazing job along with Zendaya. Must see this movie if you love movies/musicals that you can sing every song too.
The Greatest Showman,57,86,audience,"Fantastic music and great visuals make this a blast to watch. While the story is predictable and not historically accurate, that's not why you watch a movie like this."
The Greatest Showman,57,86,audience,"The movie was awesome. Best way to describe it. I just finished watching it for what must have been the 5th or 6th time and it just gets better and better. In terms of cinematography, this is a 10/10. From choreography to character development, down to the message itself, it's all great. I've heard things about this not being historically accurate and I will say that I have not done any research myself towards this statement, but I for one think that I would much rather have it be a great, heartfelt movie, than a boring and or sad historically accurate one. I applaud Hugh Jackman for his range in acting as well as the rest of the cast. Truly a 10/10 and I can't wait to watch it for the 7th time :)"
The Greatest Showman,57,86,audience,"Amazing soundtracks !
Amzaing cast !
AMAZING MOVIE !"
The Greatest Showman,57,86,audience,"While it is challenging for me to support a movie that advertises P.T. Barnum - a man who started his business with the circus by leasing an enslaved woman - as the hero, Hugh Jackman puts on a beautiful performance in this film. I loved the music and the cast had no lack of talent for singing. P.T. Barnum's goal of Dazzling his audience worked on me and apparently many other viewers. I watched this movie with my five year old nephew and it kept his attention the entire time, which is saying a lot. His favorite part was all the dancing . The overall idea of not letting fortune allow you to forget those who helped get you there is a great theme for life. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies as long as I look past the history of Barnum."
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
It's a rollercoaster of story and music that occasionally moves too fast but delivers enough thrills along the way to be worth the price of admission.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
A serious look at P.T. Barnum's life requires acknowledgment of the ways in which his success manifested. The Greatest Showman is therefore just as much of a fraud as he was.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
While one can fault this sugar-coated take on the Barnum character, it's hard to find fault with Jackman's portrayal of him.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
Hugh Jackman dazzles as circus tycoon P.T. Barnum in this criminally underrated biopic featuring a timeless Pasek & Paul songbook of ""A Million Dreams"" and ""Never Enough.""
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
It won't be classified as the best movie in the world (or musical for that matter) but it is easy to see why the appeal for the film has been infectious and unanimous.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
A festive musical treat with an enchanting performance from Jackman and a feel-good soundtrack you'll be hunting down as soon as you leave the cinema.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
What is said to be a 'celebration of humanity' lacks just that, using flair and manipulation instead.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
The Greatest Showman is a spectacular modern musical extravaganza in the classic Hollywood style.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
Thinking back on this film is giving me a headache. It is a frustrating mess, with much to mock. However, I do admit to being swept along with some of the musical numbers and circus scenes. Ultimately I have to accept that a large part of me enjoyed it.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
This movie does a solid job of presenting its story and providing a fantastic place for these new songs.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
This movie does still suffer from a lot of the same problems, musically, that La La Land did, where I can't understand a word that the chorus is saying.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
It had that magic of a musical... I don't know if I'd recommend it. It felt like it was peacocking me the whole time.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
This isn't a subtle, finely tuned piece of art, this is cheery lunacy that revels in its attempt to call back on the positive musicals of the past.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
My question is, why not focus on the real facts by digging deeper? What a shame, not only to Barnum's character but also to Lind's.
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
The Greatest Showman is so much fun. You got Hugh Jackman's contagious charisma, Zac Efron holding his own and Zendaya flying through the air with ease.

This film may not be the greatest show, but in this film, [Hugh] Jackman is the greatest showman.

From the cast to the costumes to the music, The Greatest Showman has so much to offer and with a PG rating, it's the perfect movie to take the whole family to this holiday season
 "
The Greatest Showman,57,86,critic,"
Hugh Jackman is asked to merely coast in a splashy but shallow picture that might as well have been called American Idle.

In the end, just like Barnum himself, it's all a fraud.
 "
Creed II,83,79,audience,"Great movie! Fits into the Rocky franchise perfectly, and is a great follow-up to Creed! In context to Rocky 2, its an absolute tear jerker. Michael B Jordon gives an amazing, and convincing performance along side Sylvester Stallone who still portrays the champ like he did in the 80's. Also nice to watch a movie that didn't spend the majority of its runtime ticking woke boxes. Would love to see more from this franchise."
Creed II,83,79,audience,"Overall, I think this is the best of the rocky/creed series. It has the most heart, and for the actors that are in it, the best acting of all the serie. I've watched it twice over the years that it's been out, and my opinion has only gotten better with the second watch."
Creed II,83,79,audience,"I actually prefer this one over the previous because It brings back Dolph Lundgren, the training montages are longer and there's some great acting."
Creed II,83,79,audience,A fitting continuation to the creed franchise.
Creed II,83,79,audience,"Maybe even better than the original, this film is sure not to disappoint on an action level and status."
Creed II,83,79,audience,"What a great storyline, and MBJ and Stallone were awesome. Felt long and was a little too theatrical though. (66%)"
Creed II,83,79,audience,"Creed was a pleasant addition to the Rocky lore and allowed a new audience to enjoy the series. Creed II falls into some of the early Stallone faults and over embellish on sentimental heart strings. The boxing scenes are again top notch and the return of some of the earlier characters was a nice idea. This feels like the end of Rocky's journey and it would be nice to leave him out of the series for a film or two. The pacing is sluggish this time around and I felt the director change was noticeable. There's some cringe worthy moments and that final fight wasn't the epic we deserved. The series is left in a good place and there's a chance they could resurrect some other Rocky characters from the vault in the future. I was never a huge fan of Rocky IV but this resurrects those characters successfully. I wasn't sold on this film and sadly it pulls the quality down overall. This is still a solid boxing film, just a little unmemorable. 09/12/2020"
Creed II,83,79,audience,There is no way this could beat rocky
Creed II,83,79,audience,"The boxing elements are really well put together, it's just a shame there's so much dead wood to wade through along the way "
Creed II,83,79,audience,"Family --> revenge --> family --> revenge --> family. 
The plot is too traditional."
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Reverberates with echoes of Rockys past but transcends being an exercise in déjà vu by amping up the emotional content to TKO levels. Neither a rehash nor completely original work it's simply another puzzle piece in the feel good Rocky saga.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Everything about the film happens like clockwork; there's not a single moment that isn't entirely anticipated.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
""Creed II"" not only does the franchise justice, it's further proof of Stallone's lasting creation. I predict at least one more ""Creed,"" then possibly a ""Million Dollar Baby"" style spinoff series with Adonis' daughter Amara to keep the franchise running.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
A highly entertaining, very emotionally satisfying second round that lands most of its punches, proving to be a sequel that is bound to get audiences pumped.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
If the film had been called Drago, it could have taken a more original, nuanced look at busting open the bad guy mythology and rising above a generically entertaining structure.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
This could be a fascinating look at the franchise's own cyclicality, but Stallone and Taylor don't inject much of any self-awareness in their script. They rely on formula.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Creed II, like the second Rocky film, is a comeback story. It's the tale of a rematch. Unfortunately for the audience, the trajectory of Creed II so closely resembles Rocky II that the film becomes painfully predictable.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Not quite living up to its predecessor, the Rocky hardcore fan base will still get a major kick at this nostalgic fight back. More Rocky 7 than Creed 2, the first half missed the brilliance of Coogler, but it came back fighting in the second half.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
It is a routine sequel weighed down by the most hackneyed components of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Creed II works best as a story about fathers and sons, and the legacies we are either blessed or cursed with at birth.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Creed II is hit and miss, but it's a mostly worthy successor to a film so strong, it would almost be impossible to match. Due largely to a cast that brings more to the film than the screenplay can sustain, the movie delivers in most of the right places.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Since it has borrowed from its parent franchise, Creed II's plot devices are pure sports movie pedigree, but, like its predecessor, the direction and performances raise it to a higher level.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
reed 2 film doesn't reach the dizzying heights of the original but is still a quasi-satisfying chapter in the Rocky franchise.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Scripted by Stallone and Juel Taylor, Creed II deserves a cheer.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Stallone has never been one to phone it in, and his script, as silly as it can be, is vintage Rocky. The performances are fantastic as well.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Battle fatigue sets in roughly halfway through this eighth installment of Sylvester Stallone's Rocky franchise.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Overall, Michael B. Jordan knocks it out of the park (or the ring?) again, providing a strong emotional backbone to the movie.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
I almost found myself rooting for Viktor Drago to win the final fight, not because of any anti-American sentiment, but because it's always fun to see the actual underdog win.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Creed II is like the best parts of Rocky II-V hot glued together.
 "
Creed II,83,79,critic,"
Much like the Rocky Sequels, this movie is a good movie, it pulls you in and you really do care about Adonis, Bianca, and Rocky and all those who surround them, as well as their antagonists.

Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,audience,GOSH I HATE THIS MOVIE. its so boring and cringy. The only message of this movie is to show how much disney owns.
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,audience,"A strong sequel though it does not have quite the same heart, and compact plot as the first film. The humour is better than last time and the characters are developed further nicely. The Internet as a setting is also very well incorporated. There is also a good life lesson to take away from this."
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,audience,"2019-4-1 I enjoy watching this for the entire movie, even the singing part XD and the story turned that you couldn't guess what's the next. Love the part that all the princesses gathered together too XD"

Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,audience,"It’s good fun, and is a bit like Ready Player One for Disney at some points (in a good way), with Gal Gadot as stunning in voiceover as she is in person. But it doesn’t feel very Disney Animation - and is about 20 minutes too long."
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,critic,"
A very specific story about two animated characters that illuminates universal themes from the real world.
 "
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,critic,"
The cuteness and the spattering of witty parodies aren't enough to overcome the slowness, the repetition, and the lack of emotional content.

In what sometimes feels like a dare for the most advertising space in a single frame, Disney's latest delays its emotional core too late in the game.

A highly entertaining sequel to a franchise that is navigating an ingenious path. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,critic,"
It's a triumphant return for Ralph, whilst the witty references and content connect with the adults, it most certainly proves foreign code to its intended younger audience.
 "
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,critic,"
It makes for a cute, engaging movie with seemingly endless opportunities for Disney brand synergy.
 "
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,critic,"
This is one of the best animated works of the year, and certainly one of the smartest and most visually inventive in recent memory.

Despite my nit-picky small disappointments, Ralph Breaks the Internet is still a fun sequel, with some interesting commentary on internet culture.
 "
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,critic,"
It's charming and self-aware, but not enough to really elevate Ralph Breaks The Internet beyond a routine kid-pleasing pot boiler.
 "
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,critic,"
Ralph Breaks the Internet is sweet, funny and clever, proving that Disney can create something more relatable than your typical fairytale.
 "
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,critic,"
There are dozens and dozens of internet meme callouts, appearances by YouTube celebrities like Dani Fernandez, Colleen Ballinger[...But the best part of Wreck-It Ralph 2 really is the story of growth between Ralph and Vanellope.
 "
Ralph Breaks the Internet,88,65,critic,"
Ralph Breaks The Internet comes across as a lifeless cash grab designed to promote every single brand known to man. There are some creative ideas, but the heart of the first film is completely gone.

As sequels go this one hits the mark. It is enjoyable and entertaining and offers TONS of Easter eggs for the audience to dissect.

The best part of this feature film is the gathering of princesses. This is where Disney goes where nobody thought of them reaching.

The best animated films provoke wonder and awe in younger audiences and speak in clever code to adults. The worst are loud gibberish that offer to cheaply babysit. This is somewhere in the middle.

The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,audience,"i don't care what everybody else thinks, but i actually like this film! yes i do miss rooney mara as this badass character, however i thought claire foy held her own & diving into that backstory was interesting af okkkkkk"
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,audience,"Whoever cast Claire Foy is a moron. The movie's just a wannabe, un-related to anything in the books."
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,audience,"Not as good as the Fincher installment, and there is a few moments they misfire on Lisbeth's character. The filmmakers take a hard pivot from feminist survival angle into a Bourn-esk action film genie. Odd choice, but you'll have fun if you suspend your disbelief. Just go with it. LaKeith Stanfield steals the show."
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,audience,"Great continuation, despite couch critics playing the ""If it ain't Citizen Kane it's not entertaining."" which is why couch critics are such a joke."
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,audience,"One of the most unrealistic films set in the real world I've ever seen. There are so many silly action sequences - the hacking, the motorcycle jumping onto cracking ice, the falling out of windows. The action is just absurd, unbelievable rubbish. There was classic Hollywood style fake hacking because they couldn't be bothered to depict things realistically like in Mr Robot. Moreover, the plot was terrible and extremely predictable. Why would the NSA lock a top secret program with a code that an employee's kid can solve? Why was the police chief lady naive enough to believe that the terrorists would hand over Firewall? Why was an NSA desk guy running around Sweden with a sniper rifle? How is it possible to have a 3D thermal scan of the inside of a building to snipe through brick walls? Clare Foy was nowhere near as good as Rooney Mara in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and the other cast were average at best as well. All of the characters were garbage. Finally, the cinematography and soundtrack were generic, and the visual effects could have been considerably better. Don't waste your time watching this. Go watch/rewatch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo instead."
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,audience,"Great performance by Claire Foy, everything else is just grotesquely stupid."
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,audience,"Clare Foy takes on the role of computer hacker Lisbeth Salendar in this continuation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo series. This is, I feel, the weakest of the sequence despite Foy's best efforts. I'm not sure whether time has moved on and this kind of story no longer seems as relevant or contemporary as it once did but for some reason, the story just didn't click and the situations just seemed to have been rehashed from other, better movies. A shame as Salendar as a character probably could sustain several more tales but here, she seems trapped and stifled by previous plots and has failed to grow or mature."
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,audience,"Weak script and direction, a not worthy continuation of the Scandinavian movies since it lacked authenticity"
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,audience,It was a good action and emotional movie. I like European made movies. The latex bag I still don't  know why they used it in movie. The character Lizbeth was very strong.
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,audience,"Very confusion in parts. A fair amount of action  i don't know, maybe I need to watch it again as I'm sure I've missed many points to this film.rotten tomatoes gives this 37%. Id be giving it 20% max."
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
There's almost no investigative journalism whatsoever; Mikael's history as a reporter seems irrelevant.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
A movie that is similar to ""Dragon Tattoo"" in name only after scrapping the author (god speed Larsson), director (farewell Fincher) and cast (adios Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig) for an entirely different experience that feels awkward to watch.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
On evidence of this, it is likely that this Lisbeth will suffer a similar fate of Rooney Mara's before her, one of lukewarm commercial reception and eventual abandonment.

Playing out like a boring Bond stripped of that franchise's knowing humour, the fight sequences are thoroughly unimpressive, as are the snoozesome car chases.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
The Girl In The Spider's Web is nothing like the complex thriller I was expecting it to be, cramming far too much into its runtime and leaving me feeling dissatisfied.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
Apart from Foy's expressive performance, layered with a controlled emotional vulnerability, its plot is extremely one dimensional and predictable. You really don't need to have read the books to figure out.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
What we get is Salander turned into a punk-rock James Bond, which sounds cool on paper, but the execution is deadly dull.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
A faded facsimile of earlier versions of this franchise, ""The Girl in the Spider's Web"" is a toothless thriller that waters down anything interesting about the lead character and squanders a fantastic cast.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
Instead, the new tale... has too many plot holes and coincidences to be called an assured rebooting of the property and character.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
The emphasis on action over the general intrigue that the Millenium novels have come to embody ends up cheapening the overall film.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
In developing the property for a broader audience, the film has essentially removed what made its predecessor so effective.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
It's a perfectly serviceable actioner that's fronted by one hell of a woman, and features enough exciting (and conveniently timed) set pieces that seem tailor made to please action-ready audiences
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
It's clear that Alvarez really wanted to make a spy thriller, and that sort of template is a very poor fit for this girl and her dragon tattoo, misfiring in spite of a spirited performance by Foy.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
Luckily, the performances across the board and Alvarez's camera tricks beef up the run-of-the-mill plot.

The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
The movie's such a mess.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
The Girl in the Spider's Web tries to give us the female version of James Bond; instead, it gives us a gender-swapped version of the worst 007 movie in recent memory.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
As soon as the title sequence of Fede Alvarez' The Girl in the Spider's Web unfurls over two thunderingly dull minutes at the start of the film, it's becomes crystal-clear just how much of a bad idea this endeavor was for everybody.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
Goes high tech, has little drama and is dark in mood.
 "
The Girl in the Spider's Web,39,35,critic,"
A solid but ultimately mediocre thriller, not as hard-hitting or thought-provoking as earlier entries in Stieg Larsson's Millennium series.

Mid90s,80,80,audience,absolutely horrendous. Worst movie I have ever seen in my life
Mid90s,80,80,audience,"What was with the underage smacking! WRONG. Other than that, Jonah Hill did a decent job."
Mid90s,80,80,audience,"A well-made timepiece that is fun to watch and look at on the surface, but the story could've gone further."
Mid90s,80,80,audience,"Earnestly crafted with as many 90s callbacks as you can stomach, Mid90s provides a glimpse into the lives of a rough and tumble group of teenagers who stumble through L.A. in search of acceptance, purpose, and company. A movie concerned with both the social hierarchies of household and a group of young skateboarders, Mid90s offers no universal social messages, but it does portray loyalty as only teenagers can know it, even if it's in passing."
Mid90s,80,80,audience,"Mid90's tells quite a complex story, however, in attempting to do so it can fall short. Yet, it is still a very strong and ambitious debut from Hill, supported well by a very talented cast. I only wish he better used Lucas Hedges.
7/10"
Mid90s,80,80,audience,"Esse filme retrata muito bem os anos 90. Para aqueles que, como eu e o Stevie, passaram a adolescência nessa rica década, conferir a história é indispensável."
Mid90s,80,80,audience,"They do hit a 90s feel, but the grungy, skater side of it; They say a lot of stuff that flew then that definitely wouldn't now. Or would it and I'm just giving today's youth too much credit? It was painful in the beginning watching how earnest and naïve the kid was, just begging for acceptance and friendship. There's good stuff in here about learning about the world when no one will teach you, about found family and how damaged people can come together to help each other but how because they're damaged they can struggle to always lift each other up. That scene at the party made me really uncomfortable, more likely it would have been the reverse and there's no way that would've been acceptable to have as a scene. And him having that much of a tolerance doesn't make any sense besides. I struggled with this one. It definitely hits a mood and touches on some good topics, but I don't know that I enjoyed it a whole lot."
Mid90s,80,80,audience,"A lousy rip off of This Is England. (2006) Kind of a trashy American 90s era version of the English 80s era masterpiece. An overdose of 90s artifacts and pop icons with a weak plot, heavily borrows entire scenes from the English film. But, ""Meh, it passed the time""."
Mid90s,80,80,audience,One of the worst movies I've ever seen
Mid90s,80,80,audience,"I feel compelled to write a review because I have no idea how this film got any more than half a star. It had no story plot - just a f'ed up kid's life and a string of events jammed into  an hour and a half. I would call it more a ""drama"" than q comedy. And I absolutely cannot stand watching a film that feels like they ran out of ideas so they just end it out of nowhere. It went nowhere. This kid basically meets these messed up skater kids who lack intelligence or nuclear families and he is easily influenced into drugs, smoking, and sex with some girl who btw is like 25-30 years old and he is like 10-11! It was very inappropriate and felt awkward. Do not watch this movie!"
Mid90s,80,80,critic,"
When there's this much style and affection on show, it's a shame that the directorial perspective doesn't have the sophistication to match.
 "
Mid90s,80,80,critic,"
It's a bit superfluous, but it's also unassuming, peppered with understated characterizations that fall in line with its ethnographic makeup.
 "
Mid90s,80,80,critic,"
The drawback with Mid90s is how Hill develops the characters and their relationships once the time and settings are established.
 "
Mid90s,80,80,critic,"
The film is scrappy, rough around the edges but still quite a moving journey through the lives of these damaged kids, who are their own brand of survivors.
 "
Mid90s,80,80,critic,"
There's a lot of heady stuff going on here, even if none of it is explored very deeply. But in a way, that's what keeps Mid90s moving.
 "
Mid90s,80,80,critic,"
An earnest effort that nonetheless relies too heavily on gimmicks.

Although uneven, MID90s has an authentic and unaffected feel that uses certain motifs in an organic and honest way not typical of other films.

It's honest, emotional without ever being cheesy, and moving. Jonah Hill delivers an electrifying debut.

The Hate U Give,97,83,audience,"Sure, they left some stuff out, but that's just part of making a film adaptation of a book. It was a great movie, and the world needed it. And while it may have been meant to make a difference, it was thoroughly enjoyable and emotional too."
The Hate U Give,97,83,audience,"goddamn i knew what was going to happen (just like fruitvale station) & i still wanted a way better outcome, but i loved how this divulged more into the real world effects of racial injustice & the whole situation just really resonates on my many frustrations of what's going on today. amandla stenberg & this whole film should've gotten wayyyyyy more recognition at the oscars & could've saved that awards ceremony from being a complete failure (for NOT reflecting on where society is in today's culture)"
The Hate U Give,97,83,audience,Loved it! A tear jerker!
The Hate U Give,97,83,audience,The Hate U Give is an powerful emotional film about racism and black lives matter and it reflects on what happened from the past and thru 2020 but this movie would be talked about and would definitely remember and it's features really strong casts powerful writing and brilliant director to make this film an independent film of all time.
The Hate U Give,97,83,audience,"The YA movie has been a much more prominent form of a film over the last decade or so. We have had the boom of the Nicholas Sparks' book adaptations, featuring young people in love, which had started majorly with the release of the Notebook in 2004. Combined that with the sub-genre of YA with Post-Apocalyptic world stories, kicking that craze off with the release of The Hunger Games in 2012, starring Jennifer Lawrence. The Hunger Games was such a huge success, that sequels followed, which tied with their source material and a handful of franchises that based their plots around young, predominately teenager characters in life or death situations in a dystopian world, such as The Maze Runner and Divergent franchises.

The YA genre is certainly not original and has over time covered different types of stories centred on ‘Young Adults', but the question is whether any filmmaker or writer can bring anything fresh to the table. The film in question is this movie starring Amandla Stenberg, who had also starred in a post-apocalyptic YA film called The Darkest Minds, so she is in familiar territory. Based on a novel by Angie Thomas, the film stars Amandla Stenberg as Starr Carter, a young black girl who lives in a poor neighbourhood but attends an upper-class school, sent by her parents (played by Regina Hall and Russell Hornsby).

Her parents have a clear radical past and her dad enforces on his family to believe in themselves and stay tough in a cruel, hating world, which stays within Starr. When she attends a party, she bumps into an old friend Kahlil, and gunfire is drawn, and the party members disperse. Kahlil drives her back home only to be pulled over by a police officer who assuming Kahlil carried a weapon, open fires and kills him, leaving Starr to look on in horror. The family are told the policeman won't be charged unjustifiably pending an investigation, Starr understandably becomes appalled and confused at this injustice.

While mourning the loss of her friend, Starr and her family's life spiral completely out of control, as the media and outraged citizens of the black community turn Kahlil's death into a call to arms. Her school life is affected as her fellow classmates use his death as an opportunity to protest in order to skip class for that reason only. There is a subplot involving her uncle (played by Anthony Mackie), a gang lord who want to hurt her family after she reveals her family's past to a news presenter and so her dad dangerously slips further and further back into the world he once occupied in order to protect his family from harm's way. Starr tries desperately to cope with her grief and the ensuing madness around her, as she finally decides after all what she knows is right and has to say.

The film and, it's source material deal with heavy and topical subject matter, and to approach this story from the perspective of a young teenager is interesting but also important; a lot of what happens not just here and, in the world, today, influences younger people and shapes their lives. First and fore-most Amandla Stenberg is just amazing in the role, she brings a mature but powerful and subdued performance that vastly dominate the proceedings. What we know from her world point is clear from her portrayal as Starr and effectively shows us the anguish and confusion that her character goes through, as it seems like the whole world is against her.

Regina Hall and Russell Hornsby are also very good here, never giving in to over-acting or melodramatic gestures that might hinder the film. The film tells this story but never at the expense of great characterisation or subtlety. I think it is an important film that should be seen by not just young people on their own but with their families with which could generate important conversations. The message is timely, relevant and never feels the need to look down on young people or needing to wander into a melodramatic contrivance to make its point. It isn't an easy film to watch nor should it be, George Tillman Jr. the director, who has experience tackling young demographic aimed material before, most notably the Nicholas Sparks adaptation of The Longest Ride and it's to his credit that he understands the message of the source material, and has a confident hand to get great performances out of his cast very well.

The film proves there is life to be had in the YA genre and room to tell engaging stories for younger people that are effective, raw and honest and acts as a befitting swan-song to screenwriter Audrey Wells."
The Hate U Give,97,83,audience,"Both timely and timeless. Perhaps a little disappointed with its need to close with a ""happy ending,"" but overall is still very good, in particular handling some very tough subject matter very well. Amandla Stenberg is mesmerizing in the lead role, and the cast more generally is outstanding."
The Hate U Give,97,83,audience,"The Hate U Give is not entirely bad, just not entirely memorable. I feel like this movie is really trying to stand out with its message and characters, and it just doesn't seem to do that in a unique or interesting way, despite it having some good scenes in it."
The Hate U Give,97,83,audience,very mild story -  meant for peoples first introduction to racial empathy.
The Hate U Give,97,83,audience,"The Hate U Give it's absolutely really important independent film with very strong powerful performance by Amandla Stenberg , great director and outstanding screenplay."
The Hate U Give,97,83,audience,"Starr Carter is constantly switching between two worlds -- the poor, mostly black neighborhood where she lives and the wealthy, mostly white prep school that she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is soon shattered when she witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend at the hands of a police officer. Facing pressure from all sides of the community, Starr must find her voice and decide to stand up for what's right. This movie is deep and very good. Based off the bestselling book."

More than simply highlighting prejudice, The Hate U Give peels back another layer and examines the issues that can divide the Black community from within.

A topic few mainstream films ever touch, yet Tillman does so with humor and grace, and an unmistakable fire that is hard to shake.

Tom & Jerry,24,83,critic,"
Yes, it's awful. And you're playing into its hands if you don't interrogate exactly why it's awful. It's awful because it thinks you'll want to feed this to your children. It's awful because it's probably right.
 "

Essentially like if 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' got redone as a bad rom-com.

Just because kids will laugh at the chase scenes and poop jokes doesn't make the movie worthy of a family-night selection.

Now, you might wonder if characters whose body of work consists almost entirely of shorts can translate to a full-length feature. The answer is ... sort of?

I caught myself smiling every time the dynamic duo was doing their thing and shrugging mildly many times, when the rest of the live-action characters took center stage.
 "
Tom & Jerry,24,83,critic,"
Tom and Jerry begrudgingly trade in the show's pratfall strengths for an unnecessary and overworked busyness.
 "
Tom & Jerry,24,83,critic,"
The cast seem afraid to truly embrace the fact that there are cartoon critters right next to them - all save Ferran, showing unexpected comedic panache as Joy, the slightly off-kilter bell hop.

Tom and Jerry are great when they're front and center. I just wish they were front center more.

I'm a Chloë Grace Moretz fan, but she keeps getting entwined in these odd live-action/animation and special FX flicks...
 "
Tom & Jerry,24,83,critic,"
Despite a promising visual approach combining live-action with hand-drawn style animation, these iconic cartoon characters are badly let down by a limp script and unambitious direction.
 "
Tom & Jerry,24,83,critic,"
Where the film flops is with the live-action elements. Not every performer can make it look like they are interacting with animated characters.
 "
Tom & Jerry,24,83,critic,"
This slapdash cinematic lark feels like a holdover from another era, lost in a time capsule of style and perspective.
 "
Tom & Jerry,24,83,critic,"
Director Tim Story seeks to bring the franchise up to date with this mash-up of live action and computer animation, but the result is like a bad version of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit.""
 "
Tom & Jerry,24,83,critic,"
While the parts of the film involving Tom and Jerry getting into wild antics generally work, the multiple subplots ... are hit and miss at best.

Some cursing, drinking in inspiring music docu.
 "
Beastie Boys Story,94,85,critic,"
Diamond and Horovitz tell the Beastie Boys' extraordinary story with just the right amount of self-deprecating humour.
 "
Beastie Boys Story,94,85,critic,"
This is funny and ultimately very touching - just make sure you stay for the end credits and some star cameos.
 "
Beastie Boys Story,94,85,critic,"
It's all pretty straightforward. But Diamond and Horowitz are great storytellers - no surprise there - and Jonze adds video clips and photos on the giant screen behind them (and makes the occasional mistake, played for laughs).
 "
Beastie Boys Story,94,85,critic,"
Even better is the way they let themselves be open about their experiences, choices, and slip-ups along the way.
 "
Beastie Boys Story,94,85,critic,"
Quite a lot of the stories are about singing the praises of the late, great Adam Yauch (MCA)... He was, according to his friends, a genius, innovator, considerate, curious, and a mystery.

John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,audience,"A fun, Charming, witty and Dark special This musical is a absolutely hilarious and insane ride"
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,audience,"John Mulaney and a gang of mostly kids put on a fun musical for hubby and wife date night.  Laughs abound, but wife loved how precise the music was.  Since hubby is uncultured swine and doesn't do nuance he gives the movie an 8/10.  Wife on the other hand has manners and gives it a 10/10.  Average: 9/10"
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,audience,Loved it. Unique comedy.
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,audience,"One-of-kind. Worth it to see Jake Gyllenahaal as Mr. Music alone, but so refreshingly enjoyable all the way through."
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,audience,John Mulaney has created something we didnt realise we needed so desperately. A revisit to the classic children's television of the 80's this is a comedic musical treat grounded by the sincerity of its incredible young cast. The 5 stars is a result of the once in a lifetime contribution from Jake Gyllenhal. Bravo Mr Music and all involved.
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,audience,"This was very different, clever, funny, topical and relevant.  My 13-year-old daughter and I loved it.  We hope it launches a new TV series, because we would tune in each week to see what's next! Or at the bare minimum, quarterly or seasonal specials to continue this great idea of a show for kids/adults."
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,audience,"Enjoyable watch, especially the juxtaposition of the thoughts of kids and that of the adults, loved  the general ponderous nature. Could have benefited from more laughs, as it was a bit flat at times, and losing the Jake Gyllenhaal skit at the end which came off as quite crazed to me rather that whimsical."
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,audience,"One of the most enjoyably creative projects I've seen on Netflix. Mulaney balances the exact right amount of goofy and thoughtful in a way that is somehow, amazingly, equal doses of hilarious, positive, and brutal. All culminating in an experience that is essentially an honest children's show teaching real adults about real life. Simply a must watch."
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,audience,I haven't gotten that song about the white lady crying out of my head since I watched it.
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,audience,A solid mix of freshly original quirky kindness and humor that harkens back to a sweet time of imagination and improvisation. I enjoyed it and it kept me on my toes. Some head scratching moments but overall made me laugh and feel good.
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
OK, this one is more 1970s-style variety show than stand-up special, but it is delightful.
 "
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
The marvellously droll John Mulaney is in top form alongside a cohort of suitably arch mini-mes in this satirical take on old-fashioned children's TV specials.

John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
It's a most loving poke at a genre left behind in the age of irony, when people didn't care how silly they looked as long as they got a chance to entertain.
 "
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
John Mulaney and the Sack Lunch Bunch is a definite recommend for a pretty wide audience. Perhaps not for those still watching children's programming but teens to adults will surely be entertained.
 "
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
Who knew a childless, 30-something white man from Chicago would be one of the most reliable soldiers in the fight against toxic masculinity and a champion for weird and wonderful kids everywhere?
 "
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
The special combines everything that Mulaney is good at - dry jokes and asides, writing... catchy, entertaining musical numbers, and his performative earnestness that pairs shockingly well with a cast of absurdly talented children.
 "
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
It's not tongue-in-cheek; it means everything it puts out there, but it makes sure the audience knows how absurd it is because children are absurd-genuinely, sincerely, seriously absurd. They're weird and deep and dark, and this is the show they deserve.
 "
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
This colorful show takes a new approach to sketch comedy that falls flat in the areas of delivery, humor and cohesion.
 "
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
Mulaney offers counterprogramming, a quirky variety show with a modern Broadway sensibility. At its best, and most fully realized, it feels like a program made by unusually sophisticated, precocious children for their friends.
 "
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
Mulaney, his cast, and his talented celebrity guests do well by the content they have, but this special is the best fit for older tweens and teens along with adult viewers.
 "
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch Bunch excels at amplifying those weird moments of pre-adolescence, when you're trying to assert yourself more but aren't always taken seriously because you're ""just a kid.""

While plugging into a potent strain of existential humor, The Sack Lunch Bunch remains earnest in its execution and reverent toward its inspirations.
 "
John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch,96,77,critic,"
In lesser hands, the premise of this Netflix comedy special could have resulted in an epic fail - a career-stalling stumble. Mulaney is far too good to let that happen.

Mulaney's in total control, and yet completely out of his element.

Finest Hour shows the comic at the top of his game, equal in humor, energy and originality to the best of his peers.
 "
Patton Oswalt: Finest Hour,100,85,critic,"
If this is a softer [Patton] Oswalt, at least it's his own brand of softness. And it's still hilarious.
 "
Patton Oswalt: Finest Hour,100,85,critic,"
[Patton] Oswalt is one of the most polished, literate and erudite standup comics working today. To watch someone so relaxed on stage, so loved by his audience and so sincerely appreciative in return, is always a pleasure.

Aziz Ansari: Buried Alive,100,50,audience,"Granted there's only 7 people who have reviewed this on the audience side, but I'm baffled the majority of them didn't like it. His segment on marriage was hilarious."
Aziz Ansari: Buried Alive,100,50,audience,"How did this get bad reviews??? They must not have a good sense of humor and stumbled on this thinking he'd be Tom from Parks & Rec, then got upset over the language / material. It's hysterical."
Aziz Ansari: Buried Alive,100,50,audience,I would give it 4/5 if he didn't talk about children sexual harassment as if it's not horrible. if someone who have abused a child watch the show they should be shamed of himself and the other audience should feel responsible to protect children. It's painful and absolutely not funny. I can't laugh at something that will made me cry!!!
Aziz Ansari: Buried Alive,100,50,audience,"Wow. This guy is probably the worst comedian I have ever seen.  No talent, no creativity.  Yet the nerds at RT give it 100%. 😂"
Aziz Ansari: Buried Alive,100,50,audience,How anyone thinks this guy is funny is beyond comprehension 
Aziz Ansari: Buried Alive,100,50,critic,"
While some of his relationship material is familiar, a lot of the perspective he offers in his new Netflix special Buried Alive is unique while also being immediately relatable.

While this is good, you know it could be great.
 "
Aziz Ansari: Buried Alive,100,50,critic,"
Buried Alive is a spectacularly entertaining hour-plus of stand-up, but it's also an intriguing bit of cultural anthropology.

"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,audience,really slow paced but such witty and fantastic jokes
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,audience,Needs more coherence
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,audience,"Hilarious from start to finish though obviously heavy-handed throughout... George St. Geegland (Mulaney) and Gil Faizon (Kroll) consistently and thoroughly pour out solid bit after solid bit. Worth a watch - definitely - unless you're firmly against over-the-top jokes, audience interaction and 'set' pieces that consistently find themselves falling apart."
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,audience,"Funny and creative. Very slow, however"
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,audience,"I saw this on Broadway (??) so there wasn't anything new (other than the special guests) but it still made me smile the whole time and laugh out loud a handful of times. 

The camerawork and direction is pretty great- I liked the ability to see front row details with the middle orchestra view as well as the on stage close ups. They did a great job of not making it feel too stilted and ""camcorder""y. 

Honestly it's both hilarious and a miracle that this is on Netflix because the entire joke is SO New York specific. Like, I'm super glad people like it but I'm also like really curious to see what they like about it because it's just so specific. Either way, thank St Geegland it exists."
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,audience,Insufferably slow beginning and it never got better.
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,audience,Refreshingly creative.
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,audience,"Nick Kroll and John Mulaney make a great show in Oh, Hello on Broadway."
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,critic,"
Kroll and Mulaney elevate their show to something more than just mocking old people by refusing to adhere to a traditional format and letting things play out like an overly-long SNL sketch instead.
 "
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,critic,"
This production is alt comedy at its finest, as John Mulaney and Nick Kroll indulge in each other's improv, skewer every Broadway trope imaginable, and relish every opportunity to make the audience (or each other) uncomfortable.
 "
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,critic,"
The duo's adorable mannerisms are as important as their inner toxicity, which soon comes spilling out. This is a love letter to a certain stereotype, but it's an acidic one, eager to mock its sublimated biases.
 "
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,critic,"
Its sense of humor is deeply specific and heavily referential... it's also proof that a specific perspective and an alienated audience don't necessarily go hand in hand.
 "
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,critic,"
Oh, Hello on Broadway may be one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
 "
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,critic,"
Both Mulaney and Kroll will continue their upward ascent. It's only a matter of time until they reach the superstar level they both deserve.
 "
"Oh, Hello On Broadway",88,82,critic,"
Witnessing these two work is as enjoyable as the many, many jokes they've snuck into the show.

John Mulaney: The Comeback Kid,100,96,audience,Superb. Mulaney at his Mulaniest.
John Mulaney: The Comeback Kid,100,96,critic,"
Watch for the laughs, but also the pleasure of watching a masterful entertainer grow into his talents.
 "
John Mulaney: The Comeback Kid,100,96,critic,"
The nonthreatening, paper-thin pushover (his own characterization) gave himself a tough act to follow after his fantastic 2012 special, New in Town. But Mulaney comes through in the hour-long Comeback.
 "
John Mulaney: The Comeback Kid,100,96,critic,"
As a comedian, Mulaney is much more interested in breaking down the rules of language than he is literal laws of society.
 "
John Mulaney: The Comeback Kid,100,96,critic,"
It's a reminder of everything that makes Mulaney so singular: storytelling rich with well-observed details, delivered with the confidence of someone decades older than 33.
 "
John Mulaney: The Comeback Kid,100,96,critic,"
You can tell why two broadcast networks and no less an esteemed comedy maven as Lorne Michaels thought John Mulaney should be a TV star. The stand-up comedian is great on camera, as he repeatedly demonstrates in his new hour-long special.
 "
John Mulaney: The Comeback Kid,100,96,critic,"
Mulaney's work benefits from the writer's carefully crafted timing, and in the past he's adeptly drawn out parts, punctuated others and built his jokes with a cadence and rhythm that add to their humor.
 "
John Mulaney: The Comeback Kid,100,96,critic,"
Mulaney is as energetic and engaging as ever, perhaps reinvigorated by the stage after giving the sitcom thing a try.
 "
John Mulaney: The Comeback Kid,100,96,critic,"
It's sharp and intelligent and whips along.

The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience is a dizzying mix of music and visuals that balances itself perfectly between overt ridiculousness, telling a bittersweet story, and respect for the craft.
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
It's musically and visually impressive, and features nice little roles for Jenny Slate, Maya Rudolph and the vocal talents of Sia.
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
The Lonely Island remind us that, in 2019, grandiose pop star introspect is such an easy indulgence pretty much anyone can cop to it, even these two bozos.
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience genuinely feels as though it were made especially for me; it is a smart, hilarious piece of work by a remarkably talented trio.
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
It's as hilarious as you can imagine. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience is a weird flex, but we'd be more than OK if the Lonely Island gave us more stuff like this, on a streamer that's clearly content to let them do whatever the hell they want.
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
In the end, what stands out about the project is not the baseball premise, but the format: the first and best tear-down of the visual album conceit.
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
The Unauthorized Bash Brothers is equally vicious and loving, showing the two athletes as hapless idiots driving by smashing balls and trolling for women.
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
In between, dream sequences, short sketches and even spoken word stitch together the music videos into a cohesive throughline. And there are plenty of celebrity guest stars making appearances in those videos.
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
If anything, TUBBE exists as a wildcard example of funny dudes making something for shits and guaranteed giggles.
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience is joke-dense and visually rich, but comes up short on a key factor for making the Lonely Island big leagues: It doesn't invite the type of repeat viewing that built the cults of Hot Rod and Popstar.
 "
The Lonely Island Presents: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience,100,,critic,"
It is everything Samberg stands for, perfectly condensed into a tight half-hour. Everybody deserves to watch this today.

John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,audience,He's very funny. Very witty Super smart. The pace of this is great. All set against a backdrop of art deco Radio City Music Hall. Great thematic content. I didn't know whether I liked him before I saw this. This made me a fan.

John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,audience,John Mulaney at his best.
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,audience,"
Cannot recommend this enough. He is classy. He is animated. He is funny as hell.
"
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,audience,"Out of all of John Mulaney's specials, ""Kid Gorgeous at Radio City"" has the most buzz surrounding it. Make no mistake, this is a very entertaining and well-written comedy special, but for me, I found it to be the weakest of the three on Netflix. There are a few jokes in particular that are absolutely hilarious but there were also a good amount I thought were just okay. Nonetheless, Mulaney has a lot of charm on stage and really uses current events and personal experiences to tell effective jokes and stories and anyone who's a fan of that will like this award-winning comedy special."
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,audience,Taught me the magic of street smarts.
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,audience,This guy is not funny. I stopped wasting my time after the street smarts routine. Terrible.
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
What follows is a special that manages to find some intimacy within what was once the world's largest auditoriums, while never once losing sight that, holy shit, Mulaney's playing Radio City.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
This is arguably Mulaney's best hour special yet, a showcase for his immaculate writing and captivating stagecraft.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
If you're of a certain age, you'll find yourself nodding in agreement.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
With ""Kid Gorgeous,"" John Mulaney made the leap from highly respected writer and comic to elite A-list stand-up.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
Mulaney's gift is his ability to avoid being mechanical or stiff, as his showmanship and modulated mischievousness add an intoxicating layer of looseness to his set. The guy is just infuriatingly good.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
In this new stand-up, Mulaney eviscerates pretty much everything (school assemblies, aging, manners, church) with his patented good-humored charm... In other words, Mulaney's at his best here
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
He may not be as profane or as prolific as the late great Carlin, but Mulaney is as worthy of celebration.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
Mulaney's best work to date isn't only extremely funny-it's expertly choreographed, down to his fancy footwork. He goes long on well-paced yarns, like the silliness of proving you're human to a computer-and wherever he takes you, the payoff is satisfying.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
Kid Gorgeous is a polished, whip-smart, joyful offering from a midcareer comic who's made all three of those descriptors a signature. To be great, a special doesn't necessarily have to be a game-changer-it just has to make you laugh.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
If you don't know who John Mulaney is yet, it's time for you to catch the heck up.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
With this new special Mulaney proves that he's not just one of the best comedians working today but one of the most consistent.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
Mulaney's comedy of childhood is not neutered or toothless or simply nice; in it, you can see the pockets of darkness that lurk beneath the high-achiever persona.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
This is standup as clockwork, the kind you don't always appreciate fully as it's happening, but take a closer look and those gears are calibrated in some pretty impressive ways.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
It's a perfect Mulaney bit: silly, implacably dark and completely original.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
Newcomers to the Mulaney effect - with its sharp writing and deceptively acerbic delivery - will be blown away as well. Highly recommended.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
With Kid Gorgeous, Mulaney continues to be consistent as both a writer and performer.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
For a guy whose eagerness to both please and admit his own lack of personal authority is so central to his act, politics would appear to be a tricky tonal minefield to navigate. But Mulaney's inevitable Trump material is brilliantly crafted.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
It's fun to pinpoint the nexus of a comedian's obsession, and he's showing it to us here, which is why Kid Gorgeous might later be seen as a milestone in his artistic development.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
The first half of the special seems a little slow in general... But somewhere around the middle - somewhere around a Mick Jagger impression, which sounds terrible but isn't - it takes flight. After that, it's very good.
 "
John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,100,89,critic,"
With Kid Gorgeous, Mulaney is proving he can endure in a field that even the most successful and talented comics can struggle to stay afloat in.

W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,audience,"When a racist bigot is preaching to the choir.
20 minutes in, and not a smile in my face, but still gave the guy a chance. Perhaps it will pick up... until he started talking about the Honorable Louis Farrakhan. That did it for me.
 That was just a racist rant. Not comedy."
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,audience,The worst stand up special I've ever 🥶seen.
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,audience,Didn't laugh once. It seemed like he was paid to integrate a long list of SJW bullshit rhetoric into a garbage 'comedy' act.
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,audience,I didn't find any of this funny. Overly political anti Trump B.S. This is what happens when SJWs attempt to write comedy.
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
If you're looking for a progressive echo chamber, you won't find it in this thoughtful special. Private School Negro is full of rightful criticism, but it's also compassionate.
 "
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
Sadly, the moments of focus and purpose are fleeting, and Bell squanders too much of his time on dated talking points and extraneous anecdotes.
 "
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
[Bell's] stand-up was never dense with punch lines, but ""Private School Negro"" veers further from a tight club set, toward a mix of storytelling, jokes and arguments. It's a rambling, sometimes overly familiar hour.
 "
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
Offers a wonderful mix of sociopolitical commentary and everyday humor, thereby presenting something for everyone.
 "
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
Bell flexes the same genial, conversational style seen during his far-flung interview segments for ""United Shades"" and stretches out on topics from the current political climate to his perspective on race and gender relationships.
 "
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
A timely, energetic set that covers politics, racism, parenting, TV, and, in one of the stories he shares in Private School Negro, watching political TV coverage about a racist while parenting.
 "
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
Gives off a town hall impression, and Bell effectively leads one. He wears his status as a voice-of-reason comedian like a loose shirt, presenting plenty of ideas that earn applause breaks but not without playfully undercutting them.
 "
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
The TV host and podcaster has always been skilled at finding the comic absurdity in darkness, but it's the moving way he talks about searching for hope that really makes this hour resonate.
 "
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
In an era of political and social strife, Bell is the bright comedic light we all need.
 "
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
We need more comedians like Bell in these moments while we can get them.
 "
W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,82,29,critic,"
Ultimately the strength of Bell's comedy comes from his ability to draw so many groups of people together with his humor.

"Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey",56,56,audience,"161230: This film starts out a bit harsh and tragic. Poor old Nestor is truly mistreated, if not abused. He survives of course, carries on and discovers his strengths. Some decent animated characters, I especially liked the Romans, and catchy tunes."

It's harmless enough.
 "
"Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey",56,56,critic,"
Nestor isn't the best Rankin-Bass special, but it's worth seeing for its serious midsection and gratifying conclusion.
 "
"Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey",56,56,critic,"
As a whole, Nester is a well-intentioned (if lesser) version of the ""misfits can make a difference"" story that Rankin/Bass did much better in Rudolph. The story is thin and sometime struggles to fill the brief 22-minute running time.
 "
"Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey",56,56,critic,"
A terrible rewrite of Rudolph without any of the magic.
 "
"Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey",56,56,critic,"
There are charming moments (as there are in all Rankin/Bass specials) but it never delivers quite as well as it should.
 "
"Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey",56,56,critic,"
Clearly desperate to duplicate the success of Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Nestor fails to recapture the magic of its inspiration, or provide us with anything new.
 "
"Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey",56,56,critic,"
This is the best way to tell the Christmas story in Animagic: with the proper amount of pathos and levity -- and fun character design, too.
 "
"Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey",56,56,critic,"
Muller's script is willing to go for the jugular in terms of pathos. Plus, watching this one lets you realize how much terror of being made fun of as a child animates Rankin/Bass.
 "
"Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey",56,56,critic,"
Nestor is a cute, fun little story sure to delight children of all ages -- it's just not Rankin/Bass' finest hour.
 "
The Little Drummer Boy,75,60,audience,"It's a little scary for younger children (a house burns down with people inside), but for older kids it sends a powerful message about friendships and forgiveness. The animation wasn't the best, and neither was the music; I found more enjoyment laughing at the characters then actually watching the movie."
The Little Drummer Boy,75,60,audience,"animation has not aged well, but has a few memorable moments and a good ending"
The Little Drummer Boy,75,60,audience,"Probably the most talented voice cast of any of the Christmas specials with an amazing story that tells all what the true spirit of Christmas is. Amazing!

This is so well done with so many talents. Paul Frees was was one of the best voices and he did voices in almost every Christmas Special.  He also was the voice of Boris in Rocky & Bullwinkle. 

Greer Garson is an all time talent with the great Jose Ferrer.  The Viena Boys Choir tops it off."

It's a lot like How The Grinch Stole Christmas, in other words, only with a Biblical foundation and not so much rhyming. The special is effective as all get-out, too.
 "

I thought ""Rudolph"" was the worst animation I had seen, until seeing Drummer Boy again. Aaron the misanthropic drummer, formerly with Metallica, and his animal friends skitter across the Sinai like cockroaches on Red Bull.

A Christmas children's special that actually depicts events from the Bible? What a concept!

Certainly lives up to its reputation as the bleakest of the Rankin/Bass collection. But the 20 minutes of wallowing in misery is worthwhile for the company's best finale ever.

A poignant third act restores his faith in humanity, all the while making up for some of the roughest animation work in the Videocraft catalogue.

A tiresome journey to the end. Its heart is in the right place, but it never arrives at a place that's interesting.
 "
The Little Drummer Boy,75,60,critic,"
It paints people in a really terrible light and is actually more of a reflection of the social climate of 1968.
 "
The Little Drummer Boy,75,60,critic,"
The drummer boy is a misanthrope who hates all of humanity, which makes for a surprisingly entertaining character to follow around. Rankin/Bass was terrified of playing up the darker sides of its characters. It shouldn't have been.
 "
The Little Drummer Boy,75,60,critic,"
It has some truly touching moments near the end and you can't deny that the Rankin/Bass stop-action animation is still pretty cool.

Rudolph's Shiny New Year,50,52,audience,"This Rankin / Bass Christmas film is all over the place, featuring elements of a number of fairy tales, and figures from history including Ben Franklin, among others.

Rudolph's Shiny New Year,50,52,audience,"I think ""Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" is classic television.  This sequel made over a decade later is ... not classic.  It's fine.  I think my main issue with it is that while the original was grounded in shared Christmas mythology, this one is pretty much just a mish-mash of made up stuff.  An evil buzzard steals Baby New Year, so Father Time sends Rudolph to the Archipelago of Last Year, which are ... time travel islands.  Rudolph teams up with Benjamin Franklin, a caveman and a robot clock to ... really, who cares?  Father Time is voiced by Red Skelton, and they made him look too much like him.  I found it weird and disconcerting.  

Useless trivia moment:

I saw this in 1976 when it first aired, and it was the first time I had ever heard the word ""archipelago""."
Rudolph's Shiny New Year,50,52,audience,"Rudolph saves the day once again in the all new adventure Rudolph's Shiny New Year.  When the Baby New Year, Happy, goes missing Father Time turns to Rudolph for help.  Red Skelton voices Father Time and sings several of the song (which are quite lighthearted and fun).  And the animators create a number of interesting characters that play on the time theme (Eon, Big Ben, General Ticker).  However the storytelling is rather poor, and seems to be full of plot holes and contrivances.  Still, overall Rudolph's Shiny New year is an incredibly entertaining film."

Rudolph's Shiny New Year,50,52,critic,"
It all adds up to a largely nonsensical wintertime fairy tale, but with Rankin/Bass' seasonal powers in the process of diminishing, Rudolph's Shiny New Year represents a last-ditch effort to synthesize a number of imaginative concepts into a single story.

The Year Without a Santa Claus,90,83,audience,"A holiday classic for the ages.

The Year Without a Santa Claus (1974) is, perhaps, my favorite of Rankin/Bass' stop motion Christmas cartoons. Ever since I was a child and watched this every Christmas season, I have loved the touching songs, goofy characters, odd story, and sweet message. It's a wondrous little short film for the whole family.

The detail and fluidity in Rankin/Bass' stop motion figures and animation is better than ever. The characters appear to move more smoothly. Their designs are much more complex and refined than their previous outings. Rankin/Bass outdid themselves with this one!

Above all, I think even more than the lovely voice cast, people remember the songs from The Year Without a Santa Claus most of all. The Snow Miser theme song, I Believe in Santa Claus, and Blue Christmas are my favorites as they each represent an aspect of Christmas. Namely: playfulness, belief, and kindness. The empathy shown for these cute little characters is impress and always warms my heart around the holidays.

I highly recommend watching The Year Without a Santa Claus. It's still cute, if childish, and quite short. You will not be bored at how it has aged. The catchy songs are worth the price of admission alone! I love this one dearly."

The best one of all - and surely we can all agree on this one - is The Year Without A Santa Claus. On top of being an animated Christmas special, it's also a musical with songs like I Could Be Santa Claus and Blue Christmas.

Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,94,89,audience,"A much better, yet different movie than 'Robin's Wish', this documentary gives a review of the complex life of Robin Williams.  Hubby and wife both laughed throughout.  A comic genius, who often was tortured by that mind, but this is a glossy doc.  If most people like ya, you're gonna get a doc that isn't particularly hard hitting.  This works and was fun and sad and worth your time.  Hubby: 8.8 Wife: 9.0 Average: 8.9/10"
Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,94,89,audience,"A rudimentary bio-doc that isn't very insightful, but which features excellent archival material

Directed by Marina Zenovich, Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind is a rudimentary bio-doc that fails to live up to its subtitle. It asks questions about Williams, gives him a platform, marvels at his on-stage energy, but never manages to elucidate much in the way of psychological insight. Perhaps a little too respectful of her subject, Zenovich avoids hagiography, but so too does she gloss over some of the darker aspects, although it's certainly laudable that she refuses to allow the manner of his death become the defining moment of his life. What the film does have going for it, however, is the archival footage, which shows Williams at the height of his powers. And, ultimately, the quality of this footage offsets the film's failure to offer a deep dive into his thought-processes.

Featuring interviews with people such as Billy Crystal, Steve Martin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Pam Dawber, the film includes clips from Williams's 1986 performance at the Met Opera House; the outtakes from his improvisations explaining the uses of a stick during a 1991 appearance on Sesame Street; and his improvised ""acceptance speech"" at the 2003 Critics Choice Awards, where he was nominated for Best Actor alongside Jack Nicholson and Daniel Day-Lewis, and the result was a draw between Nicholson and Day-Lewis (""it's been a wonderful evening for me, to walk away with nothing; coming here with no expectations, leaving here with no expectations. It's pretty much been a Buddhist evening for me"").

From a biographical perspective, the film details such events as his 1973 scholarship to Juilliard, where he and Christopher Reeve were the only students selected by John Houseman to join the Advanced Program; how the death of John Belushi led to Williams getting clean;  his celebrated appearance alongside Steve Martin in Mike Nichols's 1988 production of Waiting for Godot at the Lincoln Centre; checking himself into rehab in 2014 to treat his remerging alcoholism; his diagnosis with early stage Parkinson's; and ultimately, his suicide.

Also touched on is that his father was a very stern man, and it was when a young Williams saw him laugh at Jonathan Winters, that he first began to consider a career in comedy. Also interesting is how he changed the manner in which sitcoms were shot. When he started on Mork & Mindy in 1978, all American sitcoms were shot with a three-camera set-up (one for the wide shot, the others for close-ups). However, due to his unpredictability, he would rarely stick to his marks, making it impossible for close-ups, as the operators never knew where he was going to go. And so, the show's executive producer Garry Marshall introduced a fourth camera, whose sole purview was to follow Williams.

The use of audio interviews with Williams, which act as narration, see him more contemplative; ""I don't tell jokes, I use characters as a vehicle for me. I seldom just talk as myself."" This is, of course, a key admission, and is one of the main themes of the film – the private man hiding behind the public entertainer. However, the film fails to explore this dissonance; it's touched on a few times, but it's never examined in any detail. Indeed, for a film which literally invites the audience into the subject's mind, there's very little of any psychological worth.

Another problem is Zenovich's unwillingness to depict some of the darker aspects of his life. Lip-service is given to some of it, but nothing more (Elayne Boosler talks about being his girlfriend whilst giving her blessing for him to be with other women; Billy Crystal explains that he was addicted to audience reaction; Steve Martin discusses how difficult he found sobriety). However, apart from these brief moments, Zenovich never examines any of the issues thrown up. And as much as they are glossed over, there's nothing at all on Dawber's claim that Williams fondled her and exposed himself to her on the set of Mork & Mindy, even if only to reiterate that she was never offended or threatened.

The film's structure is also a little unusual, focusing on his rise in the 70s and 80s and the last few years of his life, without spending a huge amount of time looking at the intervening years. Because of this, when his 2014 suicide comes, it feels very abrupt.

The argument could be made that Williams was notoriously difficult to know even in real life, hence we shouldn't expect a documentary to lay him bare, but the fact is that Zenovich doesn't really try. And I can't help but think that presenting some of the darker times would have been a more truthful approach; it wouldn't have tarnished his legacy, but it would have made for a deeper film. In the end, Williams was consumed by his demons, but Come Inside My Mind sidelines those same demons as much as possible, hoping, perhaps, that we remember the laughter, without dwelling on the sadness."

Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,94,89,audience,"It's an excellent movie that will be a treasure for his fans.  It goes through his life from a kid right up til the end.

It followed that up by showing clips of his best roles/characters in movies as well as clips from his stand-up specials.  It was great to hear intimate stories about him from his close friends.  It really painted a picture of who he truly was.  My only complaint was that they sort of rushed through his death.  It would've been nice to hear more stories, especially from his family, about how the health problems affected and changed him.
Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone who ever was a fan of his."
Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,94,89,audience,"An overall great portrait of Williams life, equally hilarious and tragic. It's hard to condense Williams' life into any sort of accessible narrative but this hits a lot of the main points with poignancy and insight."
Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,94,89,audience,Really entertaining and insightful portrait of the comedian.
Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,94,89,audience,"Yet another reminder that all the fame, money and success in the world won't make you happy. Thereâ(TM)s nothing terribly new or outstanding here, but Robin will always certainly be a character worth hanging out with."
Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,94,89,audience,"""Robin would just be...whatever person he was with, he'd be...what they wanted him to be. He just...didn't operate like normal people. He was very vulnerable that's for sure. He held onto a lot of things and internalized a lot of things. He felt everything.""

I've never felt closer to Robin Williams."
Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,94,89,audience,"One of the best documentaries I’ve ever seen. Funny, emotional... it perfectly encapsulates Robin’s life with ideological messages to enjoy it."
Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,94,89,audience,"Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind is an absolutely fascinating documentary that shows the life, career, and psyche of one of the funniest comedians who ever lived.

Chris Gethard: Career Suicide,100,74,audience,"Chris Gethard is not at all funny. This special is him whining about how sad he is, because he can't quite accept the truth: He is not a comedian. He is a sweet guy who gives others a place to act silly, but this contains almost no comedy, and the emotional part is entirely because he won't quit the job he is not built for. Hey Chris: Not everyone needs to be a comedian! When will you fill up the attention-craving hole your parents and teachers gave you? You're famous! Stop trying to get attention and do something useful with your life. Go become a nurse! Or a mentor even."
Chris Gethard: Career Suicide,100,74,audience,not sure why anyone thought him funny. One of the unfunniest shows I've seen!
Chris Gethard: Career Suicide,100,74,audience,One of the greatest comedy specials of all-time. Period.
Chris Gethard: Career Suicide,100,74,critic,"
Career Suicide is hilarious, deeply sad, and ultimately cathartic to watch. Over the course of 90 minutes, Gethard forges an intimate level of trust with the audience.
 "
Chris Gethard: Career Suicide,100,74,critic,"
Career Suicide does feel a bit long, but it's clear Gethard wanted to take his time. He gets people to laugh at the fact that sometimes people break, and there's always a way to put yourself back together.
 "

He's brought that genuineness to a format-the comedy special-that can be quite restrictive, transforming Career Suicide into something much more akin to an open, casual conversation with an old friend.
 "
Chris Gethard: Career Suicide,100,74,critic,"

Mr. Gethard's delivery often belies - thank goodness - the dark waters he swims through.

Career Suicide is suffused with that spirit, a display of Gethard's deft ability to balance confessional honesty with a keen nose for the absurd.

But what separates Gethard from the rest of his class is his uncanny ability to pull off moments of pathos without a shred of ironic detachment.

[Chris] Gethard's show succeeds as comedy and as confessional theater, complete with stellar impressions of Morrissey, but let's not discount its power as a model of behavior.

Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow,60,43,audience,I have seen Turkey Hollow half a dozen times.  I don't personally love it but my daughter does. There is nothing to object to. I loved Labyrinth and my husband loved dark crystal at this age so I guess this is Henson for a new generation. Also the magic has nothing to do with Santa Claus so it isn't limited to Christmas or Thanksgiving and there is no uncomfortable questions for parents. Actually I guess I do love it.

Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow,60,43,audience,This was cute and enjoyable. The kids loved it.
Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow,60,43,audience,"Lionsgate's new Thanksgiving movie Turkey Hollow is this year's best new holiday offering. This movie, originally crafted by Jerry Juhl and the late, great Jim Henson, is a must have for every single family not just this year but every year. It proves this centrally through its writing. This includes not just the story presented within the script but the script's dialogue and even the feeling of the story presented throughout. That will all be discussed shortly. It is just one way in which Turkey Hollow proves itself to be such an impressive movie. Being that Turkey Hollow is a TV movie instead of a big screen feature, its transitions are just as important to note in its presentation as its writing. That will be discussed at more length later. Last but hardly least of note here is the work of the movie's cast. From veteran actress Mary Steenburgen's ecclectic Aunt Cly to rapper Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges' own comic portrayal as the story's on-screen narrator, to that of Cly's nephew Ron and his kids Annie and Tim, the cast's work in front of the camera rounds out the movie's most important elements. Even Sheriff Grover (Reese Alexander) offers his own share of laughs. That is not to ignore the work of the movie's makeup and costume department either. Thanks to their work, Cly looks somewhat akin to famed singer Cher. And Linden Banks, who portrays the vile Eldridge Slump, looks every part the evil old money-grubbing persona. Whether for the work that was put in to bring each actor's character to life, for the cast's work, the editors (in regards to the movie's transitions) or for those responsible for the movie's script, all of the noted elements play their own important part to the whole of this movie. Altogether, they make Turkey Hollow the single-best new holiday movie of 2015 hands down.

Turkey Hollow is the single-best new holiday movie of 2015. This movie, which originally aired on Lifetime over the weekend, will be available Tuesday, November 24th in stores and online. For those that were not lucky enough to see the movie in its original broadcast this past Saturday, there is so much to like about it beginning with its writing. This includes not only the movie's script but its dialogue and the very feel of the story presented within that script. Jim Henson and Jerry Juhl's script is so important to the movie's overall writing thanks in large part to its simplicity. It sees a divorced father--Ron Emmerson (Jay Harrington--American Reunion, Better Off Ted, Benched) bringing his kids Annie (Genevieve Buechner-The Final Cut, Caprica, Jennifer's Body) and Tim (Graham Verchere-A Girl's Best Friend, Perfect Match, Impastor) to visit Ron's ecclectic aunt--Cly (Mary Steenburgen-Back To The Future Part III, The Proposal, Step Brothers) after a family shakeup--a divorce. Anyone that saw the movie will get that joke. While there, Tim ends up getting into trouble and bringing to a head a years-long fued between Cly and her vile farmer neighbor Eldridge Slump (Linden Banks--Deep Rising, Antitrust, Wind Chill). Thanks to Tim's curiosity, Slump is able to threaten Cly, telling her that he can take her farm. It is a variation of a classic story. But it is still original in that it isn't just the standard old school story of a person/family trying to hold onto a farm. The story's execution is what makes it so wonderfully enjoyable. There are some friendly little magical forest animals who lend a hand along the way and who also reveal to Tim and Annie the truth behind Turkey Hollow's legendary Howling Hoodoo. Yes, that is really what it is called. And it is such a silly name that one can't help but smile every time that one says its name. The occasional cutaways to narrator Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges offers even more enjoyment to the script. It shows that neither Juhl nor Henson (may he rest in peace) took themselves seriously in crafting this script. Rather they had so much fun in creating it. In turn , audiences will have just as much fun in watching it. It is all just one part of what makes the writing behind Turkey Hollow such a strong point of the movie.

The script that lies at the center of Turkey Hollow's writing is clearly among the most important aspects of the movie's enjoyment. It is just one element of the writing that makes the writing (and the movie in whole) so enjoyable, too. The dialogue incorporated into the movie is just as important to the movie's whole as the movie's story. Being a Jim Henson story, there is not a single foul word to be heard anywhere in the movie. That being the case, one can only wonder why it received a TV-PG rating. Audiences will love hearing Annie complain, like the typical teenager that she is, about not having internet access while at Turkey Hollow or even television. Her complaints are even accompanied by the use of the term ""hashtag."" On the opposite side, there is Tim and his wide-eyed optimism and interest in everything. Audiences will love the pair's back and forth when they meet Squonk, Zorp, Burble, and Thring. And yes, those are in fact the names of the monsters. Again, much as with a Dr. Seuss story, the names are so silly that they will put just as much of a smile on audiences' faces. Audiences will love hearing Annie ask Tim incredulously about his ability to suddenly speak the language of their new furry friends. His reaction to her questioning is just as classic. It won't be given away. But it will have audiences laughing just as much as her question. There is also the dialogue between Cly and Sheriff Grover to note in regards to the dialogue. Sheriff Grover trying to hide his feelings for Cly are great. that's just because he gets so tongue-tied as he tries to maintain his professionalism around her. And of course what great family movie would be complete without the hilarious lines from the evil villain's bumbling henchmen? There are plenty of laughs from their lines as from any of the movie's other dialogue. There are so many other examples that could be cited to show just how important the dialogue is to the movie's writing. Of course there is nowhere near enough time to discuss every one of the movie's lines. That being the case it can be said that the examples noted here show in their own way just how entertaining the script's dialogue proves to be just as important to Turkey Hollow's overall writing as the movie's script and its presentation to the presentation of the movie in whole.

The script and dialogue presented throughout Turkey Hollow are both equally important to the whole of the movie's writing as already noted in-depth. For all of the importance of said elements, the story's look plays just as important of a role in the writing. Audiences will note in watching this movie a presentation that wasn't written to look or even feel like so many other big screen holiday features or movies in general. It looks and feels just like Henson's classic creature features (of sorts). From the backdrops to the shooting style, to the very fact that it used actual hand-made puppets instead of CG creatures, everything about the look and feel of this movie makes it one that every audience should see. It proves convincingly that there is still just as much of a place in the movie making business as there is for CG if not more so. It shows that a movie doesn't need CG and other special effect or even big sets and other cosmetic elements in order to be enjoyable. It rounds out the ways in which the movie's writing shows itself to be so important to its overall presentation. All three elements together show clearly why Turkey Hollow's writing is so important to the movie's presentation in whole. Of course even considering all three elements, there is even more that could be considered such as the themes of parenting's trials and triumphs, family dynamics, and even possible hidden messages about nature versus business and so much more. There is nowhere near enough time to delve into all of that. So we will rest it all in saying that considering those additional topics and those more directly noted here, the writing that went into Turkey Hollow proves without a shadow of a doubt to be rock solid. it makes a solid foundation on which the rest of the movie's elements rest comfortably.

Turkey Hollow's writing is a hugely important piece of the movie's overall presentation. Just watching this standout family friendly holiday movie, this is obvious. Even as important as the movie's writing proves to be to the whole of the story's presentation, the story's transitions should not be ignored, either in their importance. It is a minor element to consider on the surface. But in the grand scheme of things it proves truly important to note. That is because the movie is a TV movie rather than a big screen feature. Audiences that were lucky enough to see the movie in its Lifetime premiere this past weekend will note that there were obviously commercial breaks which ended up making the movie a full two-hour presentation. Without those breaks, that run time is cut down by half an hour. So why is this important to note? It is important to note because the movie is presented in exactly the same fashion in its DVD presentation as it was on television. The breaks (the story's transition points) in the DVD's presentation are set in exactly the same spots as they were in the movie's television presentation. What this means is that audiences get the piece of mind knowing that they got in the movie's TV premiere the full, unabridged version of the movie. And they get the same presentation on DVD. Nothing has been changed in the transfer from Lifetime to DVD. That makes for even more enjoyment for audiences with each watch. It still is not the last of the movie's key notable elements. The work of the movie's cast is just as important as the movie's writing and its transitions to the movie's overall presentation.

The writing behind Turkey Hollow and its transitions in regards to its TV broadcast versus its DVD presentation collectively make for plenty of enjoyment among audiences of all ages. For all of the enjoyment that each element generates, they are not the only ways in which this movie proves itself to be such a great holiday movie. The work of the cast in terms of each member's portrayal is just as important to the whole of Turkey Hollow's presentation as the movie's writing and its transitions. Veteran actress Mary Steenburgen leads the cast as the eccentric Aunt Cly. She is great in her handling of Cly's modern-day hippie persona. At no point does Steenburgen ever try to ham it up in her role. She [Cly] is so reserved in her character. Yet there is still a certain fire inside her that alongside that reserved nature makes her so entertaining to watch. And that is thanks to Steenburgen's professional take on the character. Genevieve Buechner and Graham Verchere are just as entertaining as Annie and Tim. The pair really comes across as a brother and sister. That speaks volumes in regards to . the duo's on-screen chemistry. On a related note, rapper Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges is just as enjoyable as the movie's narrator. While he may not be on screen nearly as much as his cast mates he is still wholly entertaining in his role. It's tough to put fully into words what makes his portrayal so entertaining. But it can be said that the attitude that he portrays in the studio and on stage plays a part in that entertainment. He uses that same attitude but in a different fashion. The end result is a character that has some edge but is still a great standard narrator at the same time. Linden Banks and his henchmen are just as entertaining on the other side of the story. They are classic villains that audiences will love to root against and at whom they will love to laugh just as much in their bumbling. Together with the work of Steenburgen and the others, the work of Turkey Hollow's cast in whole makes the movie's presentation even more fun for the whole family. Together with the movie's writing and its transitions, Turkey Hollow proves in the end to be a movie that every family should see this and every holiday season. As a matter of fact, all things considered, Turkey Hollow shows in the end to be this year's best new holiday movie.

Turkey Hollow is a simple movie. But there is so much that went into bringing this movie to life. Its writing is extremely in-depth. Its scene transitions on DVD are the same as they were on television. This means that audiences get the same presentation on DVD as they did on television. The work of the movie's cast rounds out the movie's most important elements. The work of the movie's cast will put a smile on every audience's face. Of course one shouldn't ignore the work of the movie's makeup and costume department or those charged with handling the movie's look and feel. Thanks to all involved, Steenburgen looks somewhat like famed singer Cher. And Linden Banks looks every part the evil, old businessman. Thanks to the work of those charged with handling the movie's overall look and feel, the movie looks and feels just like Jim Henson's classic ""creature features."" It really looks just like his classic movies and specials thanks to the reliance on actual puppets and sets instead of CG and special effects. It makes suspension of disbelief all the easier and in turn the movie's enjoyment greater. The end result of that enjoyment is the agreement that Turkey Hollow is, in whole, the best new holiday movie of 2015. Turkey Hollow will be available in stores and online on Tuesday, November 24th. It can be ordered online direct via Turkey Hollow's official website at http://www.shopturkeyhollow.com. It can also be ordered online direct via Lionsgate's online store at http://www.lionsgateshop.com/search_results.asp?Search=Turkey%20Hollow and via Lifetime network's online store at http://www.mylifetimestore.com/jim-henson-s-turkey-hollow-dvd/details/117624982.

Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow,60,43,audience,Mary Steenburgen was excellent in this. Magical movie. Everyone should see this at least once.
Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow,60,43,audience,"Made-for-television film based upon a long abandoned story written by the late Jim Henson and Jerry Juhl.  A brother and sister visiting their aunt's farm for Thanksgiving search the woods for evidence of a monster.  Not bad, but seemed to lack the magic of earlier, classic Henson productions."
Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow,60,43,critic,"
Overall, this is smart, solid whole-family entertainment, modest in its ambitions yet far above the run of made-for-TV holiday yuck you will be offered in the weeks ahead. And it has puppets.
 "
Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow,60,43,critic,"
A modern-day fairy tale starring fantastical creatures who communicate in Mad magazine sound effects (""Burble,"" ""Zorp,"" ""Squonk,"" and ""Thwring"") ought to feel a little more unconventional than Turkey Hollow.
 "
Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow,60,43,critic,"
High art it's not, but unlike most overstuffed Lifetime movies, the whole family can watch together, and nobody winds up a chalk outline.

""I'm probably missing some great Internet snark right now,"" [Annie] whines. ""#boring."" Alas, the same hashtag can be applied to Turkey Hollow at times.

There's something here for everyone, from a curious new collection of Henson monsters to affecting themes about the struggles and triumphs of parenthood.

Love & Mercy,89,85,audience,"This movie made me read whole biography of Brian Wilson, also you tube interviews and listen Smile, etcetera. Movies which capture further investigation of featured personage  put a movies in category -  a great movie.  Great actors play."
Love & Mercy,89,85,audience,<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Love & Mercy,89,85,audience,"Great insight into Brian Wilson's world, the team effort, hearing the musical ideas forming in his mind with waves of music & sounds washing over you throughout the movie. Troubled genius celebrated well."
Love & Mercy,89,85,audience,"One of favourite films! I don't even know where to get started. This biopic was very well done from every aspect of filmmaking. The clothing, wardrobe, hair, music, cars, electronics, sets and timeline all met historical accuracy well. This story was not meant to be told as a happy and perfect one but to show life as it truly was for Brian so I really feel they gave it justice! The casting in this film was great. Not only did almost every character look exactly like who they were playing but they were also all very talented actors. Paul Dano definitely mastered the role of Brian and I feel like John Cusack did a good job as well! Not only did Paul look so similar to Brian but it was great that he had a musical background as well. It really showed especially in his singing cause there is nothing worse than watching a biopic where the actor can't sing well or sounds nothing like who they are playing! I also have to acknowledge Paul's dedication to this role as not many actors would be willing to gain 50 or so pounds for a role! John really perfected Brian's shy and introverted personality as well. Overall, I think they both really did a fabulous job of getting the audience inside of Brian's head. It was also great to see real musicians as the actors (made it feel much less like just another Hollywood production). I was also very happy to hear that Brian was very involved in the production!
If you are a fan of The Beach Boy's or Brian Wilson, this film is a must see!"
Love & Mercy,89,85,audience,"I grew up with Beach Boys music but other than knowing Brian Wilson was the creative force and that he had some personal problems, I didn't know much more.  I really enjoyed this movie, I was especially impressed with two actors playing one character, very well done indeed.  I highly recommend this film."
Love & Mercy,89,85,audience,Very good movie. John Cusack is the man.
Love & Mercy,89,85,audience,"Excellent, unsettling and very moving biopic."
Love & Mercy,89,85,audience,"Cusack and Dano shine in this, playing two evolving Brian Wilsons. This is a brilliant way to present Wilsons life and legacy."
Love & Mercy,89,85,audience,"This is one of the best music bio movies ever made, right along with Coal Miner's Daughter and La Bamba. Plus the acting by John Cusak and Paul Dano - and Elizabeth Banks and Paul giamatti - is superb. The music from Pet Sounds alone is worth the hour and a half.  In my top 10."
Love & Mercy,89,85,audience,Love Brian Wilson. Did not love this movie.
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
Unfortunately, Love and Mercy makes little effort to grapple with the postwar social climate and conditions in America that produced such an extraordinary figure. This helps account for the movie's relative thinness.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
I liked this movie.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
I liked that it was out of the box... It did try to do something different and it affected me.

If anything, the film is a loving tribute to the Beach Boys, giving us insight into the bizarre details of the groups' struggles and triumphs.

With a substantive story, a passionate cast and crew, and an experimental eye and ear, Pohlad has crafted one of the best movies of the year.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
While this feature-film biopic brings higher aspirations to the table, it doesn't always rise to the occasion demanded by its fascinating subject.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
Unfortunately creative producer and financier Bill Pohlad's revisit to the directorial role becomes a bit of a long and hard slog, regrettably warped by excess.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
It could have played it safe but it tries things and when it works I loved it.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
Love & Mercy glides forward gracefully, flitting from side to side between the two time periods like a well handled hockey puck. Its shape doesn't resemble any biopic I've ever seen, and that's its strongest quality.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
Director Bill Pohlad intricately weaves together the two Brians into a seamless tale.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
What takes ""Love and Mercy"" into the territory of greatness is the two leads -- Dano and Cusack.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
Love & Mercy is always interesting, but it's only occasionally illuminating.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
My only beef would be the casting of Elizabeth Banks, who lacks a certain depth the role requires. Other than that, it's two hours of great music and great acting.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
Its deepest truth isn't the stuff of tell-all biography: the movie shows the kind of personal obsession and hard work that goes into a seemingly carefree pop masterpiece.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
The film's discrepancies ... make for a disorienting journey that may be better spent listening to Pet Sounds one more time.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
This biopic is well worth watching because it is unlike any you have ever scene. It is not formulaic and deftly manages to avoid the clichés that so many biopics embrace - rags to riches etc.
 "
Love & Mercy,89,85,critic,"
The writing, directing and above all else, the performances of the main cast, are absolutely outstanding.

A strangely unconventional story chopped and uneasily lopped into a deeply conventional Hollywood format, right down to the trophy blonde with too many teeth. It has been squeezed -- just as Wilson was. And nothing quite hangs together.

Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas,89,41,audience,"If you enjoyed the original Elf movie, do not watch this one. It's annoyingly cheesy and happy-go-lucky. This movie's version of Buddy feels like a bootleg SpongeBob. It's good for kids, but it doesn't have the same special charm as the original."
Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas,89,41,audience,Same story as the elf movie. Will Farrell isnt the voice of buddy. Best thing about the movie was Gilbert Godfrey had a part.

Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas,89,41,audience,"really didn't enjoy this one and thought it was a cheap knock off of the original but, it did have a nice cast"
Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas,89,41,audience,"This is essentially an abridged version of the movie Elf done in the Rankin-Bass style of Christmas movies.  I never liked the Rankin-Bass stuff, but I do like Elf, and the animation here is for the most part rather delightful.  There's a few odd touches that kind of bugged me (Buddy's giraffe neck, the weird way background characters are all blue), but for the most part it works.  The story is basically the same, just shorter, cutting out a lot of the subplots and rapidly speeding up certain character development moments.  Some of the changes, like the final villains being the Naughty List-ers rather than those weirdass horseman of the apocalypse from the movie, I liked; others, like dramatically dumbing down Buddy's intelligence, I didn't.  Buddy in the original movie was extremely naïve, but he wasn't stupid.  In this version, he's a bit too dumb.  Doesn't kill it, but definitely knocks it down a few pegs.
In the end, this short special is charming.  It's not great, not that funny, and not at all necessary, but it's cute and likable and I'm glad I saw it."

Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas,89,41,audience,what a good Christmas short
Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas,89,41,audience,"This is an animated, kinda musical remake of Elf, that follows the storyline of Elf pretty closely. It just doesn't need to exist, but since it does, it was OK. Sheldon was fun."
Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas,89,41,audience,It's not as good as the original but it's not bad.
Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas,89,41,audience,"At first it sounded stupid, but it's execution is what made it good. The story is still as good as the 2003 masterpiece, its animation is awesome, its characters are as loveable as the movie, and the music is really good. Plus, Jim Parson is really good and funny as Buddy. Both the movie and special are beloved classic that'll beloved by all for years to come.

It's too much of a rehash of the original, superior Elf and the songs by Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin while fine, won't stick with viewers for a minute after the program concludes.

Muppets Most Wanted,80,58,audience,"This movie was definitely not as great as the first. Very boring storyline. The movie started out very entertaining, but later got very dull. It had a great cast, but the story lost me halfway through. There was too much crime in the story, and I feel like this movie should have been more fun like the first film. The songs were very childish, and kind of not exciting! This was a very dull film and I'm disappointed!"

Although i used to find some movies interesting and watched them, but not anymore, and Muppets Most Wanted is one of them. But despite feeling a little bit cliche the plot is NOT the worst, It's just Kermit being replaced by an antagonist (Constantine) who looks like him but has a mole, and then the townsfolk mistake the real Kermit for Constantine."
Muppets Most Wanted,80,58,audience,It's The Muppets...nuff said!
Muppets Most Wanted,80,58,audience,"A funny heist farce for families.

James Bobin's family crime comedy Muppets Most Wanted (2014) is a funny movie with a clever script full of wit, references, and silly gags. Bobin's direction is nothing special, but he creatively uses more Muppets than in The Muppets (2011), which had far too much focus on the humans in the movie. Bobin makes an appreciated course correction by focusing on The Muppets themselves that everyone loves like Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. At least there is plenty of Muppet fun for anyone to enjoy in Muppets Most Wanted.

I think James Bobin and Nicholas Stoller's script is clever and funnier joke for joke than The Muppets, but he doesn't really make much of a story up here. He apes the heist parody stuff from The Great Muppet Caper with the romance marriage angle from Muppets Take Manhattan with a modern twist. Tina Fey's Gulag gags and Ty Burrell's Interpol presence have some great jokes here.

James Thomas' editing makes Muppets Most Wanted's 112 minutes pass by quickly with few slow scenes. Don Burgess' cinematography has a lot of crafty medium shots that play around with perspective in how he shows The Muppets move and face the camera. I thought his camerawork improved a great deal since The Muppets. Christophe Beck's music is very airy with a whimsical feel, while Bret McKenzie's playful lyrics are worthy of his Flight of the Conchords fame. It's very cool that Jemaine Clement also cameos as Prison King in Muppets Most Wanted for the full Flight of the Conchords reunion.

The celebrity cameos are considerably more clever and interesting this time around. Ricky Gervais, while still his annoyingly pompous self, is pretty entertaining being the butt of the joke as Dominic Badguy. Steve Whitmire is still amazing as the versatile Kermit the Frog. Eric Jacobson pulls his weight by killing it as Miss Pissy, Fozzie Bear, Animal, and Sam Eagle. Dave Goelz is still zany as Gonzo the Great and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew. Matt Vogel is funny as the Russian frog Constantine. Peter Linz sounds more natural and comfortable as newcomer Muppet Walter from The Muppets. 

Salma Hayek has a funny running with the bulls gag with Gonzo, while Ray Liotta dances his heart out with Danny Trejo in the Gulag. I cannot even name all the neat celebrity cameos that each play a bit part for a joke with The Muppets. Saoirse Ronan, Miranda Richardson, Chloe Grace Moretz, Til Schweiger, Hugh Bonneville, Tom Hollander, Toby Jones, Mackenzie Crook, Tom Hiddleston, Stanley Tucci, and Frank Langella are some of my favorite cameos from Muppets Most Wanted. Celion Dion could have done more for her duet with Miss Piggy, Lady Gaga easily could have done a full song with Kermit or someone. Usher's gag got a laugh out of me, but he should have sang too. 

Overall, Muppets Most Wanted is still funny, but it's not that amazing of a film, especially compared to the previous Muppet movies this one rips off many ideas from, honestly."

Date and Switch,30,38,audience,"Muito escondido até existia um potencial para esse filme, mas a execução deixa muito a desejar."
Date and Switch,30,38,audience,"Friend with a gay dude!

The title name was good. The story looked interesting as well, but only a basic platform. Despite 90 minute film, there were empty in the middle of the narration. Or you can call it a drag. It started off quite good, revealing about two childhood friends growing together towards the end of the high school. Then suddenly everything changes between them when one of them declares to another that he's a gay. Following that, all the pros and cons of how their future relationship would be were told.

Family too has some part, but it was focused from a friend's perspect how unexpectedly the things would change in such situation. There was some fun, though not that great. Actors were nice, and so the direction, even though the script was taken out from the blacklist. I think averagely worked out. With usual teenage film cliches, still enjoyable one. Maybe by the youngsters. For the rest, it is good to watch as a timepass flick, otherwise not worth it.

""Date and Switch"" should have had something new to say about high school friendships. It doesn't.
 "
Date and Switch,30,38,critic,"
In place of authentic emotion and searing personal communication, there's cliche and passivity, plasticizing the kindly nature of the picture to a point where all the tension begins to resemble a bad sitcom.
 "
Date and Switch,30,38,critic,"
Date And Switch is a plucky step in the right direction for diversity in teen comedies, but it lacks the extra oomph to stand on its own merits.
 "
Date and Switch,30,38,critic,"
The subject certainly isn't dated, but the film's dull post-John Hughes, sub-Judd Apatow style of comedy is like a just-buried time capsule full of accumulated clichs.
 "
Date and Switch,30,38,critic,"
A largely enjoyable and credible coming-of-age romp, despite some forced broadness and uneven pacing.
 "
Date and Switch,30,38,critic,"
Like a fresh ripple in the near-stagnant high school movie pool, Chris Nelson's ""Date and Switch"" balances formula with winning performers, genuine humor and a generosity of spirit that this genre too often lacks.
 "
Date and Switch,30,38,critic,"
In its sloppy humor and unabashedly earnest expressions of friendship and romance, the movie feels like any likable, and generally forgettable, teen comedy. And yet with its casually handled twist, the genre ambles forward just a little bit.
 "
Date and Switch,30,38,critic,"
It's a movie about being true to yourself that's reluctant to let its real character show. At any point that it looks likely to tweak sex-comedy convention or get truly weird, it reverses course at the last minute.
 "
Date and Switch,30,38,critic,"
Lame jokes (even when delivered by comedic vets like Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman) mixed with painfully paced sequences make this potential-filled rom-com fall flat.
 "
Date and Switch,30,38,critic,"
The film's forced quirkiness and repeated displays of bro-ism in action hinder the potential for a more subtle approach to the potentially challenging issue the story depicts.

Kid 90,75,84,audience,Such a unique look into the iconic stars of my childhood. Well done Moon Frye
Kid 90,75,84,audience,"A true BTS look at the 80s and 90s through a true television icon. No stone goes unturned, and Soleil gives the viewer the good and bad of it, allowing those far from Hollywood a relatable reflection. A must-watch, especially for the '40s plus audience."
Kid 90,75,84,audience,"Unfocused, yet fascinating, 'Kid 90' is a way too self-indulgent.  I mean when you need people at the end to tell you you're the hero, it's too much.  Soleil Moon Frye's autobiographical film doesn't tell you the things you want to know about a fascinating figure.  She's very self-aware she's telling her story and clearly she wants to be the hero.  It's barely over an hour and as a time capsule it's fun, but understand how shallow the documentary is.  Why should we believe a person that spends most of the film telling us she lied to the camera? Drugs? Sex?  Everything she said was a lie when she did interviews or causes. When a person says who they are believe them.    It's terrible what has happened with her, but this comes off as more a therapy session than a film.  If you watched Punky Brewster it's a trip down memory lane and not much else.  Final Score: 5/10"
Kid 90,75,84,audience,And honest true documentary of life in the 90s.
Kid 90,75,84,audience,That was a blast from the past if ever! It was emotional yet melancholic! I loved it!
Kid 90,75,84,audience,"So I am conflicted with this film.  I am a 90's kid too, I wanted to to love it.  I thought it was well done from a production standpoint.  As far as content, I thought the footage was so-so, a ton of interviews where my interest drifted to something else, I wasn't completely engrossed. Obviously it showed that Soleil Moon Frye had a number of famous friends. It was cool to see  them in their setting. Other than than the nostalgia I thought she lived an exciting life filled with a ton of cool experiences. That's about it.  Like we said in the 90's ""Nothing to write home about.."""
Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
We've seen a fair number of stories focused on the adult struggles of child stars, but Kid 90 is something a little different...a compelling, if not entirely complete portrait of the path taken by one child star on her way to adulthood.

Frye's desire to learn what she can from her unusual childhood in the spotlight is unquestionably sincere, but the recollections and reflections she's willing to impart perhaps belong more in a diary than a documentary.

I wish [director] Frye would have chosen a path and stuck with it, offering a more cohesive, coherent, less opportunistic movie.

Even if Frye covers some painful territory, there's something joyous about Kid 90.
 "
Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
It would have been nice if the 72-minute film had expanded to fill in that gap, but Kid 90 is still a valuable and unique rewind glimpse of what it was like to be a teenage celebrity in the pre-Instagram era.
 "
Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
It's the Goodfellas of child-star sagas, about growing up in a dirty business you can never escape. The best-case scenario is you get to live the rest of your life as a schnook.
 "
Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
The destination, frankly, is probably less compelling than the journey. But Frye's wide web of contacts offers a compelling window into not only her past, but the very specific cultural moment when it all unfolded.
 "
Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
An act of memory excavation and exposure.
 "
Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
Occasionally indulgent and navel-gazey, but it comes from a place of empathy and healing.
 "
Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
Kid 90 shows the pain and growth Frye has experienced and how she has survived and thrived. This documentary provides a not uninteresting glimpse into a rarified world. However, it may work best as an extended form of redemptive therapy for its filmmaker.
 "
Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
This is Frye's third feature, following indie ""Wild Horses"" and father-daughter doc ""Sonny Boy,"" and while filming has plainly been a lifelong obsession, filmmaking does not seem to be her calling.
 "
Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
Though clumsily paced and in need of a little more structure, Soleil Moon Frye's Kid 90 is an achingly personal insight into what it means to truly understand and connect with your past.
 "
Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
Captures a remarkable snapshot in history and the cost of young stardom

kid 90 should be required viewing for any parent with a child wanting to move to Hollywood and become famous.

Kid 90,75,84,critic,"
If the unremarkableness of the moments captured in Moon Frye's footage is refreshing, it also makes for a somewhat insipid film.

Come True,89,51,audience,"I really like the visuals, atmosphere and filming style. The problem I had is the fact that people don't really dream in that ""drifting through a horror corridor"" type fashion. Not from my experience or anyone I've spoken to anyway. However, I have had friends describe the similar type of shadow figure during sleep paralysis. 

Sometimes the exaggerated emotions are a bit much and I kept think - somebody buy this girl a steak, she needs to eat something. The ending went straight over my head, I didn't see how that fit the story. Still, good work."
Come True,89,51,audience,Incredibly slow and boring. The movie amounts to nothing in the end. Lazy. 
Come True,89,51,audience,"Cool visuals, great acting, and great soundtrack. Has the ‘It Follows’ vibe down and is a decent watch to pass the time. Eerie, dark, and moody but, unfortunately, the third act is a disappointing answer to the many questions we are asked throughout the rest of the film. "
Come True,89,51,audience,"Haunting, eerie, strange, beautiful, precise."
Come True,89,51,audience,One of the most unique movies I've seen in a while. It kept me thoroughly entertained and has as an eerie and pulsing vibe.
Come True,89,51,audience,"Terrors of the subconscious that manifest itself in real life is a horror trope that has not been fully explored. Yes there was a boom in the 80's with the Nightmare on Elm Street series, Brainstorm (1983) and Dreamscape (1984), but there have been few films in this genre since. 

Come True by Anthony Scott Burns is a refreshing take on the ""nightmare"" genre with legitimately creepy, Lynchan dream sequences that reminds one of Silent Hill (or if you've played them, the Limbo and Inside games). or a fictional version of the 2015 documentary The Nightmare. 

Julia Sarah Stone does a great job playing Sarah, the sleep-deprived lead, which is a good thing because the rest of the cast pretty much sucked (they basically stare at their monitors and freak out).

But the ending with the unintelligible twist or whatever that was is so mind-numbingly stupid it almost ruined everything before it. 

EDIT: Bumping this up a 1/2 start after reading an interview with the director. That ending was intentional and was supposed to be polarizing. ""RESPECT!"""
Come True,89,51,audience,Solid moody horror piece. Not for everyone.

Come True,89,51,audience,"This did absolutely nothing for me. With no real drama, suspense or twist, I felt no connection to the characters, this was super slow and aimless. A big thumbs down from the two in this household that watched it. The trailer makes it look way more intense than it really is. Draggggggy with a lo-fi '80s soundtrack. Not entertaining in the least in my opinion but apparently there are some that found it worth their time."

Yes Day aims for the younger audiences with its dumb, quirky jokes, and eh acting with the cast ensemble. Not really much is delivered with this film. What worked? The concept idea is a missed opportunity which could have been so much more. Yes Day is similiar to Yes Man. Which this time. Kids call the shots with there parents and parents have to say yes. Which only leads to disaster. What did not work with the film? The plot is dumb. Its about parents who once was adventurous. But now they are strict with there kids. Edgar Ramirez is the fun father. Jennifer Garner is the bad guy parent. When they give there three kids a yes day to make the plans and they say yes. It can only lead to mayhem. The cast ensemble performances are terrible. Jennifer Garner and Edgard Ramirez are great but there performances are shadowed by bad acting. Along with Jenna Ortega. The script is filled with atrocious dialogue. Bad jokes and dumb silly humor which kids would love. But adults may find it boring. The direction is cliche. Evantually there is conflict with the parents and there kids. Which they separate and things get out of hand. I will say this is one of the worst films this year."
Yes Day,44,59,audience,"There are some cringe inducing moments and overall the concept is maybe a bit too wacky for me, but it delivers on an entertaining comedy with some solid heart.

Grade: B-"
Yes Day,44,59,audience,"Honestly it's pure garbage. My wife fall asleep, nothing makes sense. I only give 2 stars because one or two times it made me laugh a little. But seriously it's a waste of time. Watch the Kindergarten Cop or something like that for the 20th time, you'll have more fun."
Yes Day,44,59,audience,"I've seen this exact movie more times then I can count, probably also with Jennifer Garner. It's a cash grab, and not good on any level."
Yes Day,44,59,audience,My kids enjoyed it a lot.  It's a movie for kids that parents can tolerate.
Yes Day,44,59,audience,"Umm no way Yes Day in this Asian household. Two parents made a yes day, where for 24 hours they say Yes to everything (most of them) their three kids asked and created. 

The movie was supposed to be ridiculous but fun for the family. However, I think this would be for sure fun for the kids but not the parents. 

At the beginning the movie was actually pretty fun and enjoyable. There were things that were questionable in logic, but I was willing to ignore because the movie was for kids. However, about the second half, this movie let go of logic and turned into an unfunny and just stupid mess. I just could not smile or chuckle at the dumb stuff and void of logic that I felt could be harmful without parental guidance. 

The most annoying part of the movie was that it showed how the Yes Day turned into a shit show, but somehow the movie wanted to tell the kids that Yes Day is supposed to be good. I'm sorry but the parents got into jail at a point. 

I don't like to get mad at a movie, but this one was just not it. 2.5/10"
Yes Day,44,59,audience,I thought it was pretty fun.  It could have been better but the characters were entertaining enough.  I enjoyed the dad and his struggle to always want to be the good guy.
Yes Day,44,59,audience,"If you don't have kids this movie blows chunks. If you think Jennifer Garner is drop dead gorgeous and Ben Affleck is a fool to let her get away, google her image and stare at her for 2 hours. You'll enjoy that more than this movie. It's not that it was bad, it's just that it was not good. Ok it is that it was bad."
Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
It's a perfectly cromulent family film, a movie that will occupy you and yours for precisely the length of its 86-minute running time and not a second more.

Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
Nails the horrible feeling of being trapped with proud parents who are unreasonably confident that everybody around them must surely love their terrible, terrible children.

Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
It's rare to see the real world impinging on what is basically a Christian-inflected, highly confected, sub-Disney kind of family flick.

Miguel Arteta's film is banal and predictable, but only a real killjoy mum or dad would think of vetoing it.

[W]hen enjoyed with the whole family, Yes Day is a harmless and often humorous escape from the metaphorical barriers of real life.

Garner, Ramírez and the kids never let on that this isn't ""Epic,"" and that maybe this is one screen comedy where you can get away with ""Go ahead, try this at home.""

""Yes Day"" is a welcome diversion.
 "
Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
Kids will enjoy the sense of empowerment and anarchy, and parents will appreciate that the anarchy is tempered with some modest lessons on responsibility and equal partnership when it comes to child-wrangling.

Yes Day is the kind of light entertainment that young and old can enjoy together.
 "
Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
There's not too much of a draw for the child-free - other than a sense of relief - but the message of the importance of saying ""yes"" and ""no"" will likely resonate with its target audience, especially when presented in generally amiable packaging.
 "
Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
It's a lightweight film befitting its premise's ""good vibes only"" origins, but you could do a lot worse than say ""Yes"" to Yes Day.
 "
Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
An entertaining, family-friendly romp with wish-fulfilling yeses, extended comic mayhem, and satisfying consequences.

Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
Dad is chased by vindictive birds, Mom picks a fight at a theme park and the kids come to appreciate that, sometimes, adults are right to say no to things - like this movie.

Yes Day is inoffensive and you'll have seen worse, but when there's better family options out there, you're better off saying no.

A fun concept gets covered in suds in ""Yes Day,"" a children's fantasy about a day where parents have to say ""yes"" to everything, which allows kids to make their wildest Nickelodeon-adjacent dreams come true.

I thought I had wandered into a packed Chuck E. Cheese where all the doors were then locked and someone threw away the key.
 "
Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
Director Miguel Arteta's fun, but forgettable family comedy is certainly a step-up from last year's awful Like a Boss, but not a patch on the similarly themed Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.
 "
Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
""Yes Day"" slides too often into contrived, loudly scored montages of ""fun"" that don't transfer to those of us watching. And while Garner and Ramirez are both very fine actors, neither of them is funny.
 "
Yes Day,44,59,critic,"
It's got a neat premise and plenty of potential for laughs but the latest misfire from Netflix ends up as a foamy mess of cliché and cutesy tosh.

The Devil Below,0,20,audience,"A quick-baked movie about something sinister hiding in the depths of some abandoned mines.  What could have been mysterious, wasn't - and what could have been scary, wasn't.  When you finally see what's happening - it's a monster with no budget."
The Devil Below,0,20,audience,I enjoyed watching the movie. It kept my attention the entire time.
The Devil Below,0,20,audience,Utterly terrible!  Incoherent mess with terrible camera work and deliberately so because of the pathetic special effects.  At one point two characters are paralysed on the floor then 3 seconds later there running through some caverns.
The Devil Below,0,20,audience,"Started out pretty well, but just got siller as it went along."
The Devil Below,0,20,audience,"This was pretty poor, to be honest.
Also, the idea of a mid-twenites female hottie (hispanic, of course) being the grizzled veteran didn't help.
Will somebody please give me my decent genre movies back?"
The Devil Below,0,20,critic,"

""The Devil Below"" might work as a drinking game among friends, but its predictable, unoriginal nature should keep it buried for the rest of eternity.
 "
The Devil Below,0,20,critic,"
The Devil Below takes a while to get started, gives us some cheap attempts at horror and thrills, and ends without seeming to do much at all.
 "
The Devil Below,0,20,critic,"
""The Devil Below"" is a strange endeavor, dealing with a classic set-up for showdown with a grotesque threat, only to have the final cut work extremely hard to throttle intrigue and chills along the way.
 "
The Devil Below,0,20,critic,"
The Devil Belowis not particularly tense, jumpy, gory, or frightening. As a horror film, it disappoints.
 "
The Devil Below,0,20,critic,"
'The Devil Below' takes its purgatorial themes a bit too seriously, as the film itself feels caught in a limbo that merely exists instead of thrives.

Boogie,43,66,audience,Movie is trash if I’m being honest. The acting is subpar to be generous and the character development is god awful. Feels like there’s at least 30 minutes missing. Giving a 1 star is being very generous. RIP Pop Smoke tho.
Boogie,43,66,audience,"Eddie Huang isn’t a tactician, lacks discipline, and the ‘Chinese honor, family, and 5,000 year history’ trope is overplayed. However, this coming-of-age story is refreshing when all we get about Asians nowadays is unrelatable glamor and bling. Americans regardless of race that live in urban communities can relate to this film in one way or another. "
Boogie,43,66,audience,"I can identify. In the late 80's and early 90's I had dreams of being the first Chinese it play professional sports. I did well enough in high school, but was always told that football and basketball wasn't meant for Chinese. It was for Black and White players and I should just focus on school. I wasn't strong enough mentally to block those things out and I quit too early. I believed those people. Unfortunately I think more Asians told me that than my teammates and coaches. I never saw on TV that it was something I could do as an Asian. A movie like this is important for our young people to know that anyone of any race can do anything. Sometimes we just need people to believe in us more than we believe in ourselves."
Boogie,43,66,audience,"Very obvious this movie was the brainchild of a first time writer/director.  Sloppy story, zero romantic chemistry between the leads and chockful of cringey dialogue.  Love and Basketball is the movie this one wishes it could be, watch that one instead."
Boogie,43,66,audience,"Solid movie, doesn't do anything special but it truly is solid for what it is. I think the music fits the scenes well and the setting. The acting was a bit amateur aside from several familiar faces, and what was really surprising was Pop Smoke's acting was actually good, it didn't seem awkward at all, The interactions between all the characters are believable as well. The only thing I can see people actually having a problem with his maybe the ending, but it seems like they may be setting up for a part 2."
Boogie,43,66,audience,"A beautiful film, an insight into the life of a young person trying navigate his way through life, love, self discovery and being a son."
Boogie,43,66,audience,I loved this movie.  Eddie Huang did his thing.
Boogie,43,66,audience,Truly a movie with depth. A colorful portrayal of human struggle and fulfillment. The socio-economical tenements are effortlessly woven through the film; giving a perspective a different way-true to Huang. The love relationship btw Eleanor and Boogie radiated so much warmth it left me pensive.
Boogie,43,66,audience,"Thought I was seeing another boring sports flick with my boo, but turned out to be a really amazing flick that tugged on my heart. Perfect date movie with something for everyone! 4 thumbs up from us!"
Boogie,43,66,audience,"A modern, fresh, new take on ""coming-of-age"". This film beautifully weaves threads of cultural/societal pressures and the internal conflict they can create, with the sweet  but sometimes bitter realities of young love and friendship. Captivating performances by actors Taylor Takahashi, Taylour Paige, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., and the late Bashar Barakah Jackson (aka Pop Smoke), a brilliant soundtrack that serves a mix of new and old classics, and the gritty backdrop of NYC all contribute to the undeniable mastery of this arresting film. 5 stars and an absolute must-see!"
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
Boogie, as a result, can be an effort to tango with. But ... it has much to offer to the Asian-American cinematic representation forum - as much as it is a notable-enough showcase of Huang's voice.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
Boogie takes a good concept (a Chinese American teenager with goals to play NBA basketball) and squanders it on uneven acting, subpar filmmaking, and an obnoxious main character.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
A strong directorial debut from Eddie Huang. It's a lively, complex film that almost transcends its sports movie roots.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
At least it shines some light on Asian American athletes, but not to the degree to give ""Boogie"" some much needed cinematic boogie. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
At its best, it is a film that captures the critical conflict of trying to achieve the American Dream without compromising the culture you come from. It just takes far too many circuitous routes to get there.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
There's a lot of promise and things to enjoy and appreciate in Boogie when the movie distances itself from its own worst creative impulses.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
With so much on the line, Boogie just sort of dribbles to nothingness.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
Writer/director Eddie Huang's flawed feature does have flashes to recommend it, particularly in depicting matters of the heart between Boogie and a no-nonsense Black classmate.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
I think [Eddie Huang] represents a unique perspective on American culture... I found his point-of-view interesting.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
I really wanted to like this movie, but honestly it's really tedious.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
...the film's message proves aimless, with an emotional core almost impossible to connect with.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
Like most sports films, Boogie has more going on than it seems on the surface.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
The story of a Chinese American kid's hoop dreams is hard to enjoy when the depictions of the game are so wrongheaded.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
Huang falls short when it comes to telling a compelling sports story or delivering a heart-felt drama about cultural and parental pressures faced by a driven teenager. Boogie has a bit of both but not enough of either.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
This sports drama also feels a bit old hat even with the various intersections which would have made this seem like a novel feat two decades ago.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
This is often a painful movie to watch, between the strained and abusive relationships in his family and the problems at school. Boogie just wants and needs to be loved. He's got a chip on his shoulder a mile wide.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
Hard to imagine this one connecting with audiences ... unless you're into college hoops, which I am not.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
Boogie is an engaging story not just connected to the sport of basketball, but of heritage, life, pride, and the pursuit for something more than dream but something to love.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
Eddie Huang's debut feature has plenty of street cred but not much more. For a sports drama it's missing one key element, hope.
 "
Boogie,43,66,critic,"
I'm intrigued by Huang's creative vision for this picture, but its clumsy execution kept me from loving the experience. Boogie has swagger to spare but lacks soul.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,audience,"I will happily watch Frank Grillo repeating days forever. He's clearly one of those actors who is ageing into his looks.  I personally would be happy to describe his performance as several levels of ""phwoar.""  He's Roy, a consumate ex-military dude just trying to survive an infinite day with drink and women and fight scenes.  And he still holds a flame for his ex-wife Jemma (Naomi Watts), who's some kind of super-genius physicist type scientist, and mother of his son Joe."
Boss Level,72,79,audience,"3 out of 5 stars. Boss Level is a fair science fiction action film that follows the Groundhog Day and Happy Death Day mixed with a hardcore shoot em up action film. What worked? The plot is decent. It follows Roy (Frank Grillo) who wakes up every day repeating itself with every assassin after him and lead by Mel Gibsons character. While Roy is discovering that there is more to the agenda with his former love interest Jemma (Naomi Watts) engineering some kind of new time and weapon device. The film is action packed through out. Lots of thrill ride chases. Fighting and shoot em up action that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. Does feel like a video game with a character battling through new assassins and every bad guy has a new unique challenge skill. Which the character gets killed off and learns something new to fighting them off. Yes the action can be ridiculous and cheesy. It is done by the same director Joe Carnahan who did The A Team and Smokin Aces. You know what to expect with the action. The cast ensemble was decent with there characters. Not much development to the characters. They were forgettable. Frank Grillo works great as an action star. Mel Gibson as a villain was okay. Naomi Watts. Annabelle Wallis. And Michelle Yeoh were all underwritten. What did not work? The humor and narrative structure was not as funny it was trying to be. The humor and cheesy direction. It was annoying. The script was filled with cheesy dialogue. The visual effects were obvious and terrible. Overall, Boss Level is a cheesy action film that may entertain to some but a forgettable one."
Boss Level,72,79,audience,"Like if Groundhog Day were remade as a Deadpool sequel. Clever, fun, and well-paced, if a bit predictable."
Boss Level,72,79,audience,"Really enjoyed it. The groundhog day schtick in hollywood is a bit old, but this seems to be a pretty fresh, not as annoying take on it. And i'm just a Grillo fan so would've had to have been pretty bad for me not to enjoy this 90 minutes."
Boss Level,72,79,audience,"""Boss Level"" is one of multiple time loop movies that have come out recently. This one has more of an action movie and starts off right in the middle of the time loop. I think the movie has some fun action moments and is a quick watch, but I felt the premise was a bit complicated and underdeveloped. I liked the concept implemented here to give off the vibe of a video game but I wish it was a bit more interesting and action-heavy. Overall, this is a solid and fun movie that could have used a few improvements in the storytelling but is mostly a good time regardless."
Boss Level,72,79,audience,It's actually alot better than you may imagine. It was refreshing to see this movie.
Boss Level,72,79,audience,"Super fun, high-concept outing from Joe Carnahan (welcome back, Joe). Frank Grillo holds it down nicely as leading man."
Boss Level,72,79,audience,I had to work hard not to leave the theatre. It was not executed as well as other movies that have managed to make a great movie from this genre. Simply it falls flat and not even the great actors performing to their A list level could save it. 2.5⭐️ ⭐️
Boss Level,72,79,audience,A lot of violence with comedy!  The frustration in the character is exactly like the frustration you would feel playing a boss level over and over again.
Boss Level,72,79,audience,"Lots of action, funny. Groundhog Day meets Raiders of the Lost Ark"
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
Don't waste your time on Boss Level.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
Time and again, Grillo surprises and delights, no matter the creative or financial restraints placed upon him. Boss Level could learn a thing or two from its leading man.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
Such a strange film. I wavered between finding it ridiculous and engrossing. I ended up neither loving nor hating it, so I guess that means it is a medium film.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
One of the things I love about this movie is it knows that you've seen movies like this a million times, so it really plays with the characters.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
Although I realize it's not Poet's Corner, it's rough around the edges and it's a dude's universe, and Watts is there to wear a tight lab uniform, it's really funny, funny peculiar if you will.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
The film has a ""Deadpool""-ish verve to it, but after six or seven go-rounds (halfway in) the chamber runs dry.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
The results aren't brilliant, just ingenious enough to make for an entertaining time-waster. ""Clever story as an action movie"" pretty much sums it up.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
This high-octane time loop thriller doesn't break new ground, but it definitely knows how to have some fun within its own genre. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
Not funny or provocative at all, but simply the droning spectacle of this unlikable man being killed and then killed again.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
[Frank Grillo] is so much fun in this. Mel Gibson makes for a really terrific baddie.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
Watts and Grillo share the chemistry of a mortician and a corpse - both are doing a job, one is dead.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
The mystery remains: What on earth is Watts doing in a silly affair like this?
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
The charismatic supporting player Frank Grillo takes center stage in this entertaining time loop thriller.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
The Oscar-nominated Watts is incredibly talented, so the fact that she's the lame love interest in Boss Level opposite Mel Gibson is disappointing, to say the least.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
Boss Level doesn't score a lot of points for originality; everything you get here has pretty much been done before. That said, however you feel about formula, there's value in execution. And this movie is a well-executed version of what it is.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
Likely to develop its own devoted cult of fans, eager to put another quarter in the machine and play this shoot-'em-up game again and again.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
'Boss Level' plops Frank Grillo into a video game universe that's never fully programmed, between forgettable motivations and a final act that barely exists.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
I can only hope that Ryan Reynold's Free Guy is as good ... because this will be a tough act to follow.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
Boss Level is silly and violent fun. If that strikes your fancy, you'll dig it.
 "
Boss Level,72,79,critic,"
...a briskly-paced endeavor that benefits substantially from Grillo's compelling efforts as the tenacious central character...
 "
Moxie,68,71,audience,"Amy Poehler is a clever female comedienne known for playing well-intentioned and decent characters; which also aptly describes her second feature as a director, in which she co-stars. Hadley Robinson plays Vivian, a high-schooler who finds the sexist and toxic attitudes the male students are allowed to display sickening. With the school seemingly turning a blind eye, she decides to take matters into her hands and publishes anonymously a newsletter that exposes the injustice, which soon becomes a rallying call for other female students who share her sentiments. Except for its feminist/female empowerment agenda that seeks to make the high school environment a microcosm of the Western society at large (and political overtones that might have a thing or two to say about a certain Election in 2016), this could be just another conventional high school 'drama-comedy' where friendships are tested, the cute sensitive boy is crushed on and single mom's new beau is met with resistance from a petulant child. With familiar faces like Poehler and Ike Barinholz relegated to supporting roles, the young(ish), and less familiar looking, central cast is thankfully a spirited and likeable lot, much like the film itself. Poehler is a perfectly competent director and even slips in a Goodfellas homage at one point, while Tamara Chestna and Dylan Meyer's screenplay does a good job building up the sisterhood who bonds closer together the more their collective voices are ignored. My only reservation is a third act revelation that comes out of nowhere and its rushed and simplistic handling could do with a bit more finesse. Nevertheless, this is a boisterous and affirmative film that can positively influence the younger minds of its target audience while the rest of us can relish in a fantasy story where the suppressed can eventually get heard."
Moxie,68,71,audience,"As a feminist latinx who grew up inspired by my fathers stories of his punk rock days, I have to say not only is this movie an absolute disgrace to the punk rock community but as well as it is god awfully SHAMEFUL to the feminist movement. 

The movie ""moxie"" is more to victimise women rather then empower them, and while I do see that for there to be movement there needs to be recognition, all this movie took was the victimization of women and portray it into something supposedly ""punk"". Punk is a movement inspired by the need for change, how are you supposed to show change in a movie where all the director did was throw a leather jacket on a stuck up, socially unaware, and not to mention annoying, little white girl(the protagonist) who backs up a black girl by taking over her entire persona. If you want to truly speak out and be inspired by the diverse, at least get a sense of what the change is for and about and why it is needed. This movie shows a story of a girl who sees feminism and activism as a trend and changes her entire personality to revolve around getting a couple of answers for her college essay. 

When the truly oppressed speak out in society today, they are victimized and not given the credit they deserve for fighting. They are ignored and not listened to. So directors and producers take this and say ""oh why not sprinkle a little white privilege on it and ratings will be through the roof!"" That itself is absolutely disgusting. If you are going to use your privilege to speak out at least do it in a manner that doesn't make activism appear to be a so called ""trend"" and especially do not portray feminism in movies as unbearable and over the top or even extreme, because all it does is set a bad name to a community that is just trying to balances out the stereotypes of today and solve issues in the world by speaking out. 

The best part of this movie was the music by the iconic band Bikini Kill, but was easily washed away when it was associated with all the baggage of extremism, white privilege, and undermining the oppressed, which is the exact opposite of punk and the exact opposite of ""moxie""."
Moxie,68,71,audience,"While it does handle some delicate stuff with care, the script is just a mess, and the terrible acting does not help at all to fully deliver the relevant statement it wants to give. It's an ok film for a thirteen-year-old audience that's not aware that films like Mean Girls, Booksmart or Lady Bird (just to mention a few) even exist. 

*Don't know if it was just me but I thought the musical selection was awful. 
*In what world would you take someone to a date at a funeral home? 
*Adults can be pretty stupid and selfish."
Moxie,68,71,audience,"Terrible, jureringen in all its facets"
Moxie,68,71,audience,"Jesus, can Gen X and Boomers simply stop writing stories about Gen Z and/or Millennial generation's coming of age. It's clear you can't relate and this stale, out of touch script chock full of trope, misrepresentations of people of color, is a prime example of that. If you are younger than... 35, this movie will be cringe for you."
Moxie,68,71,audience,"I personally like the movie a lot. I do believe it skirted around topics, but overall, I don't think you'll regret watching the movie."
Moxie,68,71,audience,"Great take on adolescence and the high school experience. An empowering way to discuss issues that are typically just taken as normal in other high school films. Refreshing to see complex female heroines, and the soundtrack is excellent!"
Moxie,68,71,audience,"This film is clearly aimed at a younger audience,  so comparisons to Election and Booksmart are unfair. It holds a good message which is often hard to portray to kids under 15 but it does it well. I watched this with my 14 year old daughter and my 10 year old son and we had some laughs as well as understanding a subject I don't think we would have been told so easily even 5 years ago. It achieves everything the film sets out to do, to an age group that may still be shielded from many of the realities of sexism among children in schools."
Moxie,68,71,audience,"I don’t know if I understand the relatively high ratings... the acting was good and so was the production value and there it ends? Everything else was super contrived from two dimensional characters, overt stereotypes, bad costume design, no storyline? It felt so disconnected... I can’t help but think it would never have been green lighted if Amy poehler wasn’t behind it. I guess if you like to watch young decent actors try to make crap material watchable than add this to your watchlist, otherwise don’t waste two hours of your life."
Moxie,68,71,audience,"If like after-school special, this for you."
Moxie,68,71,critic,"
Though a fluff teen fantasy piece, it nevertheless makes some serious points.

Moxie,68,71,critic,"
The movie's heart is in the right place even if all of the puzzle pieces seem a bit too obvious.
 "
Moxie,68,71,critic,"
But too often the film is, ironically, oddly conservative and it aims for, but never quite reaches, the heights of sharper, better teenage movies such as Booksmart, Election and Mean Girls.
 "
Moxie,68,71,critic,"
In Moxie, like so many other movies with white protagonists, it's hard not to feel like the people of color are there to serve as springboards for the betterment of white characters.

Trying to fuse the feminist sensibilities of 1992 and 2021 is a promising idea, but the flaw is in the execution.

Adults won't find it as witty as Mean Girls (also now on Netflix), but it has the right verve and passion.

With a snappy script and witty direction, the movie quickly gets under the skin, telling an engaging story while igniting righteous anger.

The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run,69,55,audience,"I really didn't think it was as humorous as the other Spongebob movies, something just seemed to be missing. The CGI designed to look like stop motion was a terrible idea, the motions of the characters were choppy and stiff. The textures were quite good, but the lack of fluid movement in the animation made it a jerky distraction. The voice acting was good, the use of Keanu Reeves was a nice touch and had some funny moments, but overall I just felt like this was a very half-hearted effort."
The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run,69,55,audience,"I want a Keanu Reeves sage as my counselor too. 2 to go, please. 

The little ones will definitely have a good time with it. It may not be as ""good"" as its source material, or even the first two movies (which I'm not a fan of), but it does have some funny, weird (Machete and Snoop Dogg make an appearance, don't ask me why or how that happened), and touching moments. The animation was pretty enjoyable. Eye-popping material."

The director of the pictures manages to stay on the thin line between personal and public, though, offering the viewer an objective picture of Billie Eilish growing up mixing the intimate home scenes with the shots from large arenas. A great document of a star birth."

An interesting dive into Eilish life from her debut to the grammys night taking the time it needs to fully explore all aspects of the lifechanging stardom of the teen's life. But maybe sometimes you can feel it might be too soon to explore her life as not much as yet happened to her. And a part of it feels lost in that so called relationship with her then boyfriend Q instead of giving more screen time and interest on the life of her brother because as much as i love Billie you can just admit that Eilish is nothing without Finneas.

Safer at Home,0,81,audience,Funny and a good escape from reality - interesting filming concept from the lens of a Zoom call!!
Safer at Home,0,81,audience,"The wrong time for pills.  So this is about a group of friends who are facing quarantine fatigue.  Relatable, right?  The only difference here is that they are doing ecstasy to celebrate a birthday, and when one of them cracks their head open during an argument, who can tell where the night is going to go.  Now I am positioned uniquely with this little film in that I am friends with one of the cast members in this movie.  I've never had to give this perspective before, and I will admit that I got disconcerted by the fact that this is currently sitting on a daunting 0% fresh rating on rottentomatoes.  I was concerned if I could stay objective, but it did not take long for it to dawn on me: this is not a great movie.  Now I'm not going to lie: this movie started on the wrong foot with me.  There is something about using real-life footage of the political response to the pandemic that didn't sit right in my stomach.  Yes, everybody watching this has lived it, so all the audience can relate, but we do still use movies for escapism in some capacity, and given that this is not a documentary, it didn't feel like that had any place here.  When you get past that in the opening five minutes, you have some clumsy setup for the rest of the film in the next ten.  It's the writing more than anything that is the issue, like offhandedly bringing up a medical background in casual conversation.  Once you get through all that, it does somewhat improve, but I will say that everything this movie aspires to be was handled better in Host.  They are both movies produced under COVID constraints, but Host acknowledges it as something happening in the background without having an agenda, even though Host was more horror than thriller.  I feel like the filmmakers here needed to have a better game plan to put this story together with excitement.  The runtime is only an abbreviated 82 minutes long, but it still overstays its welcome with too many shots of characters running around.  I understand the predicament would call for a lot of sprinting around, but you still have to ask why they wouldn't just put their phone in their pocket for the cardio.  Once this got going, my interest was held, and I don't think this movie has a terrible premise.  It's the beginning and end that were turn-offs for me, and the way this movie concludes was a huge detriment.  I won't get into spoilers, but I was able to call one plot thread about an hour before it happened, and then that was further exacerbated by a new element introduced in the last five minutes that was utterly unearned.  In a different movie, it could be a conversation starter, but here, it just felt like a hot topic tacked on after the fact, which just felt insulting.  I'm all for smaller-scale movies like Safer at Home, but there needed to be better execution and writing."
Safer at Home,0,81,audience,"Super entertaining, good scare factor in both its creativity and relevance to what's going on in the world."
Safer at Home,0,81,audience,"Such a well-written, well-acted, fun, fast-paced, escapist thriller! Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time!  It's inspiring to see what you can accomplish with such a small budget!  A fantastic adrenaline-filled ride!!!"
Safer at Home,0,81,audience,I can’t believe over 80% of the RT audiences liked this movie! My friend and I really disliked it. IMHO you’re wasting your money seeing this flick. You’d be wasting your time watching it if it was on a free streaming site!
Safer at Home,0,81,audience,"Just hang in there, one day will get a good movie surrounding COVID.

This is yet another one of those movies that takes place on a laptop or some online chat room like Zoom, but in this movie, there make up a website that's just like Zoom. And of course, something bad happens in the call, but this time it's no ghost or anything supernatural. I find it a little strange how every character in this movie has the best quality cameras ever, especially on a live call, because it looks HD and cinematic. Whatever the call glitches out, you can tell it was added in post-production and it looks so terrible. And every time someone picks up their laptop or phone, they grab the camera, so it's not 100% clear what's happening there. The acting from everyone was awful, not funny bad, just bad. 

There's a really stupid moment in the movie that takes up the whole movie. Basically, the incident that gets this movie going is a heated argument between a couple while on online call with friends, he accidentally pushes his girlfriend (or his wife, I don't remember and I don't really care) to the ground, hitting her head and knocking her out cold, we shortly see blood start to comes out. You would think at this point one of the people in the call would call an ambulance, but for whatever reason they don't, and instead they take up the time to fool around in panic mood. I was literally yelling at the screen for them to call an ambulance, but sadly the characters could not hear me. That's the whole movie right there, someone accidentally commits murder while everyone else on the call is a witness.  So, expect a lot of running, a lot of yelling, and a lot of crying. The cops are called at some point. The cops chase after the guy who committed the crime. The cops shoot the guy while this online chat is still going with everyone watching. However, it turns out the girlfriend isn't dead at all and she was just knocked out. She wakes up just in time to watch her boyfriend die on camera. And then the cop who shot the boyfriend picks up the camera and sees who's in the chat, and everyone (expect for the girlfriend) quickly logins out of the call, which was unintentionally funny during a ""serious"" moment.

So, if you look at the poster, the woman screaming her head off, that is her reaction to seeing her boyfriend dying.

I just summed up the whole movie right there. You're welcome. 

So, all of this could've been avoided if they just called the ambulance. What a stupid fucking movie! And yes, I just spoiled the movie. You know a movie is bad when I don't care about spoiling it, because it's such a waste of time.

What was the point of this? 

Overall rating: Dumb"
Safer at Home,0,81,audience,An extremely weak attempt at capturing an audience with covid and zoom?  Well the movie theme was inevitable but it's execution...ooof.....    Only good thing was that it was less than 90 minutes....
Safer at Home,0,81,audience,"Finally, a new and smart feature for 2021 that breaks free from the high-tech and remake molds of the last several years. The story gets presented in a relatable, escalating way that puts us all in position to relate to the characters. The suspense is natural and it only gets more intense as the story develops and the actors draw you into their dilemma. High production value, cut to keep you on the edge of your seat, and by the time the credits roll, you've completely lost track of time! 

If you want something new, a story we can all find ourselves in, and a movie that doesn't hide behind technology or tired clichés, this one grabs you and does not let go. Safer at Home feels like a documentary come to life, a horrifically witty reminder that decisions have consequences, and that life has a maniacal way of coming together when the conditions are right!

Funny and ironic reading reviews on this site...my ultimate advice is, trust your gut, its never as good or bad as ""critics"" or ""experts"" say...too many agendas and narratives these days."
Safer at Home,0,81,audience,"I can't stop thinking about it.  A truly modern thriller for ""these times.""  Well written and smart.  Did someone just open the window because a chill just ran up my spine."

What we have here is a very annoying movie that's 2 contrived 2 B convincing.
 "
Safer at Home,0,81,critic,"
Safer at Home is the type of film we should get used to. Innovation is the key to keep directors, actors and crews working, but instead of being the next big thing, there needs to be more thought about why these stories are written and by whom.
 "
Safer at Home,0,81,critic,"
Not every story is suited for Zoom-style presentation, and this derivative, uninspired one only underlines the strain in being fit to a presentational framework that does neither actors nor audience any favors.

[T]here's no excusing the absence of thought that went into the specifics of this story and its staging.

What Host really had, and Safer at Home lacks, are credible characters. Instead, we're confronted with the same nonsensical solipsism that made everyone glad that Cloverfield had monsters.

The cast is solid, but it's the screenplay from Will Wernick and Lia Bozonelis that leads them astray with a story that's both ridiculous and cliched.

Body Brokers,64,60,audience,"Average movie with a good message...
DON'T DO DRUGS"
Body Brokers,64,60,audience,Very good movie with a good message/ information on all the corruption within the Rahab industry. A real eye-opener and will definitely start conversation on what needs to be done and ensure that people get the help they need through good rehab facilities.
Body Brokers,64,60,audience,"Wow, what a crazy informative true story. Obama-waaaa? So basically, taxpayers funded these crooked rehab centers?

Newb filmmaker John Swab casted, produced, wrote and directed this docu-type film, and did a decent job.

It is well directed and shot, and the casting was decent with Frank Grillo performing and narrating the true facts of this film. My only casting issue was Jack Kilmer as Utah; he performed well as a junkie, but after rehab he still had that monotonic expressionless boring demeanor. I'm not sure if it was his acting failing to turn-up a few notches, or Swab not directing him properly, or both, but his role in the second act was disappointing.

The score and cinematography were on point, but the 111 min runtime felt much longer with the film's often slow pacing. Swab's screenplay wasn't perfect, but told the story he was aiming to tell, quite well - enough to anger most people who have had trouble with addiction, or know someone close to them that has been through the system. Although a compelling story, the plot was too plain, but at least the details were vivid enough to keep you watching until the end. It's educational and investigative into an exploitative crime surrounding addiction. It certainly opened my eyes. Props to newb filmmaker Swab for putting this little gem together.

Overall more interesting than exciting, but nevertheless a story that really needed to be told - and I'm surprised it took this long."
Body Brokers,64,60,audience,"Poor screenplay and directing, waste of great cast."
Body Brokers,64,60,critic,"
The film does an admirable job pulling us in and making us care...
 "
Body Brokers,64,60,critic,"
Swab lulls viewers into a hopeful example of someone overcoming the odds ... and then sporadically punches us in the face with the realities of the film's world.
 "
Body Brokers,64,60,critic,"
Given the originality of Swab's take, it's a shame he couldn't find the film a more appropriate style: at heart it is a more sober film intent on declaring its outrage.
 "
Body Brokers,64,60,critic,"
Refusing to sensationalize Utah's struggle, or even make a judgement on him and his money-hungry cohorts, emphasizes Swab's empathetic yet uninhibited approach to the material, compounded by Grillo's winking snake oil salesman and his caustic voiceover.
 "
Body Brokers,64,60,critic,"
The ending comes very abruptly and, the first hour is painstakingly slow. However, it does have a very eye-opening message and contains several solid performances from Grillo, Williams, and Kilmer.

I give Swab ample credit for his well-intended critiques, but they're ultimately stuck in a scattershot narrative that rarely reaches its dramatic potential.

Body Brokers is compelling, both as a straightforward investigation into an exploitative crime ... and as an honest depiction of ... addiction.
 "
Body Brokers,64,60,critic,"
Body Brokers is a film that has an important message, but it gets a little lost in the proceedings. The narration brings it back on track at the end, but it should not have taken this to make it be able to pass its message.
 "
Body Brokers,64,60,critic,"
While director John Swab uses this framework to get around the typical story involving drug abusers, this thriller never really finds the right rhythm to stick with.
 "
Body Brokers,64,60,critic,"
Gets lost while attempting to be a searing study of fraud, with Swab often more interested in crime movie formula, fearing that any sort of direct, sustained confrontation of the treatment industry won't hold audience attention.

Fear of Rain,56,71,audience,"Lots of surprising twists. The previews suggest somewhat of horror flick, but it is more of a suspense, mystery, thriller. Not an expose on mental illness; just good entertainment, acting, and directing. Recommended if this is your genre."
Fear of Rain,56,71,audience,it was a pretty good movie and the acting was amazing
Fear of Rain,56,71,audience,There's potential for a decent mystery in the midst of the jumbled mental illness plot and the whole real or not real game.
Fear of Rain,56,71,audience,"So we have a schizophrenic student trying to figure out what's real and what's not and feeling sus that her neighbor might be kidnapping a child. 

The story was very stereotypical for a psychological thriller with mental illness involved. For the first like 2/3 of the movie I felt pretty meh because everything was going the way I expected it to. Because of this, I didn't feel on edge, despite the movie's effort to include horror imagery as part of the main character's hallucinations. The main character's way of differentiating reality from hallucination was asking herself three questions, and the movie showed these questions using creepy font. It felt pretty interesting at the beginning, but later didn't add much to the creepiness of the movie. 

When the twist came, I was pretty surprised, but also confused as to how it could happen for so long. The last third act was fairly suspenseful and got me warm up a little bit. However, it still went down like how I expected. 

Overall, even though the cast was pretty solid, the stereotypical and predictable plot didn't give the movie much tension or horror. 5.5/10"
Fear of Rain,56,71,audience,"It really bothers me the way this movie stereotypes and further stigmatizes mental illness and further  dramatizes it. Her friends all suddenly stopped talking to her because she's sick and needed treatment? That doesn't happen. And trying to portray that as a normal part of mental illness is ridiculous, particularly for teens. Teens are a little more aware and empathetic than this movie portrays them as. Very few don't have some level of mental Illness themselves so yeah, a girl with schizophrenia isn't going to get shunned and mocked by her own circle of friends upon returning to school after treatment. 
Also, she was hospitalized long enough for her friends to completely shun her but her dad couldn't be bothered to spend an hour straightening up her room before she got back? Her room was exactly as it was left...upended box springs, torn mattress, cuts all over the wall, things overturned and that's how dad welcomed her back home? 
Subtleties like this are what make or break a movie and the producers simply seem detached from how the world is in portraying teens and mental illness. 
Dad would randomly take her to the neighbors house to search for a girl based on hearing noises? And then we immediately after find out that woman has ""already filed a complaint"" and that if another gets filed, the daughter will be taken from them and institutionalized? 
And then we're reminded several times if anything goes wrong with her she's going to end up in an institution. Again, great way to portray teenagers who suffer from mental illness: if they can't control the illness then they're to blame and they'll be punished for it. 

Ultimately this movie spends an hour and 20 minutes exploiting mental illness, using every cliche in the book, going to the greatest lengths of hyperbole, detailimg exactly how unsalvageable this girl is and how far gone she is and then everyone is supposed to believe that everything is suddenly better, everyone holds hands and sings cumbayah and she's not as hopeless, destroyed and psychotic as they spent the past 80 minutes trying to convince the audience that she is.
Aside from that, it was as mediocre as any Lifetimesque made for TV After School Special could be. 
I hope in 20 years America reaches a point where people are embarrassed that a movie like this was made, let alone popular. The main lesson here is don't exploit teen mental illness to make a good movie, let alone a really horrible one."
Fear of Rain,56,71,audience,"This one barely misses the mark for me. After watching the trailer, you could kind of predict what was going to happen. I wish there was was a more interesting sequence at the end when Malia was rescued. I guess it was that ending that made me not give it a recommendation."
Fear of Rain,56,71,critic,"
Though I could relate to the sensitive way schizophrenia is treated, I could not relate to how clumsily the film is directed.
 "
Fear of Rain,56,71,critic,"
The entire cast give impeccable performances in this psychological thriller with stunning cinematography.
 "
Fear of Rain,56,71,critic,"
Fear of Rain hits the mark as a YA thriller that features great performances, a twisting story, and insight into a mental illness not usually portrayed on screen.
 "
Fear of Rain,56,71,critic,"
It stumbles over pieces that don't fit together too well, but the thoughtful, sympathetic treatment of its main character and her illness, and some solid tension, put this thriller just over the top.
 "
Fear of Rain,56,71,critic,"
Another well intentioned though defective psychological thriller that uses mental illness for narrative progression, Castille Landon's ""Fear of Rain"" has promise, but fails to hold weight beyond its Lifetime aesthetic.
 "
Fear of Rain,56,71,critic,"
Middling at best in terms of suspense mechanics, and not the most perceptive treatment of mental illness you'll ever see, this nonetheless compels interest as a well-acted drama-cum-mystery...
 "
Fear of Rain,56,71,critic,"
This is ultimately a nuanced character study, awkwardly wedged into a run-of-the-mill genre picture.
 "
Fear of Rain,56,71,critic,"
[T]he movie often contradicts itself in terms of how it treats and feels about Rain's schizophrenia.
 "
Fear of Rain,56,71,critic,"
The film portrays mental illness with all the nuance and insight of Jared Leto in Suicide Squad.

Willy's Wonderland,65,76,audience,"This movie is terrible. I watched it since it was recommended by a friend and it made me reconsider that friendship. Nic Cage never says a single line, the ""robots"" are so lazily made it is painfully obvious it is someone in a suit, the plot is stupid, the other ""actors"" are awful, it's just a crappy movie. If Nic Cage wasn't in this movie, it would have been thoroughly panned as the crapfest it is. Unfortunately, Nic Cage fanboy morons will love any god awful movie he is in. If there was a movie of Nic Cage reading a newspaper on the toilet for 90 minutes, those same fanboy idiots would give it a 5 star rating. Don't waste your time"
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,audience,"Willy’s wonderland is somewhat horror film. But for the rest of the film, it seemed more comedic than horror. Nicholas Cage plays an, ok character in this film. He doesn’t talk which is really weird. But he plays it so well. The other characters (the young adults) were not enjoyable. The only person who was out of the whole group of the young adults, was the leader of them. Liv. The animatronics were ok to look at. And not because they were scary, because they weren’t, but because they looked like a costume. Now I know that it was a low budget, but still they could’ve tried more hard. The Story was a 6/10. Not a great story, it involves with voodoo, which I don’t like in many films. But other than that, Willy’s Wonderland proves itself to be a horror/comedy than a full on horror film. I am going to give Willy’s Wonderland a: D+"
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,audience,Oh...so terrible.....😵
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,audience,"If you love Five Nights At Freddy's then this is great. think of it as if Ghost Rider spent the night there, lol"
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,audience,"Doesn't take itself too seriously and as such, just a fun, beat 'em up, slash them bots movie."
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,audience,"Awesome, must see! 
Excelente"
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,audience,Instant Classic. This is the kind of movie that will attain cult status. I will be re-watching it every year. If you are a fan of Cage and minimalist acting this is a must see.
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,audience,"Interesting movie.  The best part is Nicolas Cages dialogue, best lines of any movie he has ever done.  The story is basically Five Night at Freddy's the videogame turned into a movie.  Nicolas Cage gets suckered into spending a night at a haunted Chuck E Cheese called Willy's Wonderland.  The story is engaging and draws the view in.  The classic stereotypes of characters are here, and they do not disappoint.  Movie was fun, highly recommended.  I am not a fan of horror movies, but this one is awesome.  Will probably watch again."
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,audience,Fun Evil Dead Throwback. Would love to see a sequel.
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,audience,"I thought it was really fun, Nic acts the same way I would act if I was trapped in there and I enjoyed how it wasn't like any other boring horror movie. this was fun"
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
Willy's Wonderland is a violent, glorious riot of inside-joke horror tropes and Cage's own best tribute to a genre he helped to create.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
If you do not take it too seriously, it is destined to end up being a cult favorite.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
What could have been a fun Nic Cage romp is undone by repetition, poor characterization and a general lack of energy. Willy's Wonderland only has one joke and it quickly wears thin.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
I love the movies that thrill us without asking for too much of our time. Lewis had this entire film planned-shot for shot, reel for reel-and it shows an intent to entertain.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
Willy's Wonderland is a vicious funny little horror film that allows Cage to chew the scenery, collect his paycheck and entertain the audience all at once.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
It works because it's so goofy and so insane, and with Nicolas Cage behind it... it's over the top and fun.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
Willy's Wonderland is a total blast from start to finish. Funny, furiously violent, and with one of the coolest Cage performances this side of Mandy.

...His Cageness shakes, struts, grunts and shrieks, and it's unexpectedly awesome.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
Nicolas Cage as a silent hero against robots is a fun premise for a while, but beyond that, nothing else sticks.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
Willy's Wonderland commits the ultimate movie sin: it's boring.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
[Willy's Wonderland is] erratic, hilarious, and just the right amount of unhinged Nic Cage to get things right.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
Willy's Wonderland's high concept silliness is just about kept afloat by Nicolas Cage's knowing self-parody.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
Needlessly gory and imaginatively graphic, the just-under ninety-minute feature burns on all cylinders, not just using common horror tropes but gleefully abusing them; no sin goes unpunished as The Janitor cleans Willy's house.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
A terrific premise, badass hero, and throwback grindhouse sentiment check all the boxes for a successful journey to becoming a midnight cult classic.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
Overall, Willy's Wonderland is exactly what we expected. No surprises, just something to scratch that satisfying itch of watching Nick do what he does best don't expect.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
The result? Nearly 90 minutes of wordless Cage beating fluffy mascots with broom handles while hard rock plays on the soundtrack. It could be ironic commentary. Or an art-film stunt. But it's mostly agony.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
There are no really inspired scenes, but it's all quite fun; a one-joke movie that stretches out the joke well enough.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
Daft plot, fabulous fight scenes, teenagers in peril and plenty of gore. Sure, the film could have been better, but it didn't exactly need to be: this was thoroughly entertaining.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
There's none of [Cage's] typical spark here.
 "
Willy's Wonderland,65,76,critic,"
So effective is the film's hero that it barely needs a supporting cast. But they're here anyway, giving director Kevin Lewis his cannon fodder to splatter all over the place.

Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,audience,I don’t know why people have an issue with this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s a great dark comedy. Nothing went as expected. The acting was great. I didn’t know what to expect. 
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,audience,To think I almost didn't watch this movie because it had bad reviews. I found it hilarious and I was really glad I watched it. I love the plot twist and I'm also a big fan of most of the people in the film.
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,audience,"She lied about her husband, many people died and she gets away with it. Repeat, she lies, people get killed because of her lie and she gets away with it.

Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,audience,Why all the bad reviews? This was a funny dark comedy. The characters were all enjoyably over the top yet still believable. It's not an Oscar movie but a good time for laughs.

Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,audience,'Breaking News in Yuba County' is a woefully misguided dark comedy which despite a great cast is impaired by its stale direction and uneven humor.
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,audience,"A comedy of errors along a similar line as ""Ruthless People"" but a lesser offering. It wasn't revealed whether she took the money in the end as her brother-in-law and his wife knew about it and are the only survivors?! Fun and entertaining contrary to the critics' low score!"

Psychological comedy mixes violence, swearing with laughs.

To get a bad performance out of a reliably good character actor is a misfortune; to get bad performances out of this many actors starts to feel like malpractice.
 "
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,critic,"
For a film with lofty ambitions and a talented cast, particularly Allison Janney, Breaking News in Yuba County lacks a clear tonality or the vision to do justice to its whacky setup.
 "
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,critic,"
Taylor can't juggle the different tones, and as Sue tries to stay a step ahead of the crooks and the cops as her lies threaten to unravel, the film's attempts at societal critique feel facile.
 "
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,critic,"
It's a dreadful misstep not only for [director] Tate Taylor and [star Allison] Janney but also for everyone involved in this embarrassing mess. Breaking News in Yuba County ... is proof that having a talented cast doesn't automatically equal a good movie.
 "
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,critic,"
An incredible cast, the makings of a decent dark comedy and the inkling of some social commentary about the unhealthy obsession with media attention. But, uh, this one is a real mess.
 "
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,critic,"
Overdosing on quirks and squandering an eclectic ensemble cast, it's so busy trying to be clever that it forgets to be funny.
 "
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,critic,"
Aiming to serve a satire of American fixation on celebrity, it misses its target by some distance as it gratingly seesaws between Fargoisms and farce.

Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,critic,"
This is beyond terrible.
 "

With a background in campy movies like ""Ma,"" you'd think Taylor would just lean into the garish trashiness of it all. But ""Breaking News in Yuba County"" is afraid to go there, and so you should be too.
 "
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,critic,"
It resembles a bad improv troupe's first movie.

 "
Breaking News in Yuba County,11,51,critic,"
The film itself is trying hard to be a new-age black comedy, but along with jarring violence that seems out of touch with an otherwise comedic approach, it misses the boat when it had the bones of being a sharp satire on life in the media age.
 "

A farce that fizzles, a satire that sags, and a dead-end for its gifted cast.

In its satire of America's obsession with fame and media in all forms, the film doesn't make for a very humorous dissection. Silly and at times brutal fun at best.

Breaking News In Yuba County is weighed down by too many flimsy storylines and characters. Even Allison Janney can't save this one.

A weak imitation of much better movies.

Music,8,14,audience,"It was BAD. Even setting aside the rather offensive things Sia has said to and about autistic individuals recently, the movie isn't good. The pacing is all over the place, the dialogue is stiff, and it's just a waste of time. It's not even ""so bad it's good"" — it's just bad."
Music,8,14,audience,"If the captain of the Titanic had a 24h notice of the iceberg, and intentionally steered into it, he still would have been better at his job than Sia making this movie."
Music,8,14,audience,"This movie hits a chord and anyone who has worked with autism should be able to recognize it. The movie is creative in more ways than I can count, and the musical aspects attempt to move beyond the superficial aspects of autism and into an alternative way of understanding what the world of an autistic young woman might look like. It's the cheapest of cheap (and inaccurate) shots to say this film is a ""misguided look at autism""—implying that the critic somehow knows jack diddly about autism. Of course dullards will not get it; they never do. However, this is one treat that takes a road less traveled, and ones we rarely get to take. Kate Hudson allows herself to fall into a role that depicts self-loathing and irresponsibility, looking for redemption where there are only more trials and people even more lost than she. Maddie Ziegler is flat out brilliant as a young autistic woman. However, rather than the stereotype of a dark madness, she is shown to experience a different, colorful world where she and others enter into a joy of dance and celebration of the soul. That doesn't fit the usual images that pervade autism in young adults. The critics act like self-righteous Puritans in the trial of Hester Prynne; almost willfully ignorant of autism and any reality beyond the narrow confines of Calvinism."
Music,8,14,audience,"This is a very sad movie. Not because of the content, but the harmful representation of autistic people. Showing them in a way which feels like mockery. Showing a restraint which has claimed the lives of over 100 people. It is just awful that this is the representation that autistic people get. A truly horrible film. I hope that no one sees this, because I would hate for Sia to even get one penny of profit. (If you intend to watch it please note it has lighting + sound which could make you go into sensory overload)"
Music,8,14,audience,"A truly horrifying attempt at representation. Somehow the most clear anti-autistic ableism I, an autistic person, have seen in my whole bullied life. 

I have no doubts that were this movie released without Sia actively and explicitly insulting autistic people on twitter and in interviews (she compared us to inanimate objects) this movie would have been seen as having good info, and would have gotten autistic people killed."
Music,8,14,audience,Deeply offensive and dangerous for the autism community.
Music,8,14,audience,such poor representation of autistic people. they deserve better.
Music,8,14,audience,"Deeply offensive to autistics and shows a method of restraint that is extremely dangerous and in worst cases even deadly. Features a scene that shows the main actress in blackface and makes no apologies for any of this or even a passing remark of ""these things are bad"" throughout the garbage film. Completely unbearable to watch. I'd give 0 stars if I could. Sia should be ashamed of this film and most especially of her responses to the feedback she was given. This film was clearly just a bunch of NTs patting themselves on the back for vaguely and poorly acknowledging the existence of NDs while portraying them as burdens who view the world, as one reviewer put it, ""like coked out tellitubbies"". Absolute trash."
Music,8,14,audience,Offensive and abelist! Movie makes fun of the community and uses violent and inappropriate handling of the character having a meltdown that could genuinely kill a child. Movie also used a well known autism hate group in making the film.
Music,8,14,audience,"Music is such an ableist movie and a very inaccurate portrayal of autism. This movie does nothing to improve the view of autistic people in media, it's something a 40 year old neurotypical woman who still says ""special needs"" would watch and post about how its emotional for her. Everything Ziegler does comes across as a mockery of autistic people, from her body movements to her stims. It's not genuine and only reads as a caricature. 
Autism is a wide spectrum, not everyone experiences the same thing and we all build skills differently, none of that is present in Music. The movie tells you that she understands everything around her and then pretends that never happened and shows multiple seens of Music being unaware of her surroundings. I understand that not every autistic person is the same but don't go out of your way to tell me she's completely aware of the world around her and then have her eat gum from under a public bench. 
There was also Sia's choice to keep restraint in the movie despite how many people told her it was extremely fucking harmful. Neurotypical people will look at this and it will continue to validate whatever tiny, ableist understanding they have of neurodivergent people. The reason representation is so important is that it normalizes what it's portraying. If we could get some decent autistic representation maybe we would have less uneducated people in the world who still see autistic people as intelligent toddlers and not real people. 
I do not understand how people think this is a good fucking movie, it's nothing more than Sia continuously shitting on autism and neurodivergency as a whole. She did nothing but tell lies and misrepresent what life is like for an autistic person and the worst part is that she thinks she didn't. She thinks this is good representation and she's proud of it."
Music,8,14,critic,"
Other than the performances, there is nothing redeeming about this complete mess.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
Despite talented cast, drama is a misguided look at autism.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
Despite being intercut with extremely Sia-esque singing and dancing vignettes, the story is all too familiar and the script very ropey. Hudson does what she can with a cliché.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
There's so much that this movie gets wrong about the community that is searching to uplift.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
A completely misguided mess.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
Hudson goes to some emotionally raw and dark places, and really puts it out there in the song-and-dance department too.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
Lacking any direction, Sia slips bits of each and every style in at random and fails to achieve any of them.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
Sia isn't the first musician to try her hand at filmmaking. Music is barely a movie, however.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
It's pitiful stuff.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
The imagination and craftsmanship nearly compensate for the film's cliché characters and screenplay.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
Four years ago, a musical genius shot a stinker. That she's promoting it so aggressively now suggests that she can't see, or smell, what's right under her nose.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
The largest takeaway will never extend far past the misguided approach to this film from the get-go.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
While Sia clearly got the casting right, she didn't fulfil her resolve to tell a story that is insightful, impactful and captivating.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
When I look at Music, I don't see myself or any other autistic person I know. I see a plot device. I see a way to generate drama. I see the degrading way neurotypical people look at autistic people.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
I can handle its poor pacing and stiff dialogue, but even doing research and writing an essay on the film's problematic elements pre-release were not enough to prepare me for how harmful Music is to autistic people.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
There's passion for the project, which is refreshing, but for her big screen debut, Sia's storytelling focus is out of whack.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
How nobody involved in this doomed fiasco simply said no at any - or every - stage is baffling. Fortunately, you can.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
Released in such proximity to Sound of Metal, the astonishing insensitivity of Music seems all the more glaring.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
I feel like we've grown past these types of vapid white-knighting efforts, but Music sadly transports us back to that dated era with troubling results.
 "
Music,8,14,critic,"
A baffling inspirational drama plagued by bad directorial choices... Let's toss a huge wig over this thing and pretend it never happened.

Little Fish,91,77,audience,Interesting premise and the sci fi I tend to enjoy but it felt a bit bland to me . Maybe it was just me personally but I never felt emotionally attached to any of the characters and with a movie like this I feel that’s key . Acting was good all around idk just meh 3.0
Little Fish,91,77,audience,Best movie of the decade.
Little Fish,91,77,audience,"Little Fish finds its current and smoothly drifts in a tide with other similar emotionally-driven science fiction films such as Arrival, Melancholia and Ex Machina.  The pandemic plot-line is simply the mode of transportation to that gives its audience a tour of one couple's love story amidst a viral outbreak that leaves victims experiencing memory-loss reminiscent of early-onset Alzheimer's.  Olivia Cooke is sublime in her portrayal of emotional vulnerability while anticipating the declining prognosis of the future of her marriage.  Keegan DeWitt's score for the film fully captures the melancholic essence in its gentle tranquility."
Little Fish,91,77,audience,"Kind of slow moving and boring. Paid $6.99 to rent on Amazon, so forced myself to finish it. Clearly, someone wanted to make a romance movie, so they used a pandemic as a backdrop. The acting is not good enough for a romance movie, and the pandemic backdrop barely provides a plot. The movie isn't a good romance or sci-fi movie, and ends up just being a forgettable dud."
Little Fish,91,77,audience,"Reviewed 2.6.21  The film was written before the COVID pandemic, so it's simple luck that it feels so timely.  And it's surely just the first of countless movies to come with a pandemic influenced story line.  But I imagine few will be as simple and intimate as this romantic tale of lovers fighting the loss of their most cherished memories.  
Little Fish excels by keeping a narrow spectrum of focus on the couple's specific experiences with the illness, and ignores the greater questions for humanity.  An obvious influence would seem to be Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; in everything from the mood, to the memory loss, to small details like the pivotal opening and closing scenes taking place on a beach.  But it lacks the originality and quirkiness of that particular inspiration; at times feeling too quaint and uninspired.  What redeems the proceedings is an intriguing twist of an ending all its own."
Little Fish,91,77,audience,Had this movie on my mind days later. It’s a beautifully sad love story. 
Little Fish,91,77,audience,What a beautiful film.
Little Fish,91,77,audience,'50 first dates' meets sci-fi 'the notebook' in a lovely way. I quite enjoyed it even though it wasn't that original but the atmosphere and the cast made it worth while.
Little Fish,91,77,audience,Everything is beautiful in this movie from the storyline to the score and a beautiful delivery bey olivia cooke a must watch
Little Fish,91,77,audience,5 stars to boost the rating. Audience doesn’t see enough in this movie. Very profound
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
This heartbreaking experience will go down as one of the biggest surprises of the year.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
By keeping events intentionally intimate, Little Fish is able to ignore the extraneous and offer up something with emotional impact worthy of discussion.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
The tension created out of an underlying fear is deeply suggestive but not enough to spare us from a frustrating cinematic experience in the end.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
The film is more of a series of loosely connected vignettes told out of order...
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
This drama rises above other ""sick flick"" romances: It's a beautiful, existential tale that finds new territory to mine about the nature and extent of love and identity.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
Observing this all take place is filmed with skill, and thanks to the specific focus, there's enough for it to deliver on the emotional level.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
A moody, maudlin, well-made, acted and shot virus-themed science fiction romantic drama which boasts some interesting things to noodle on about memory.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
This is a movie that is almost wholly uncynical about love - a rarity in and of itself...To forget what we've done and where we've been is to forget who we are, both to other people and to ourselves.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
Grim but beautifully made film.

Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
A tasteful, melancholic tale of love and loss, with very compelling performances. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
Although the movie can be a bit bland, I doubt whether many viewers will be disappointed that Little Fish plays more like romance than speculative sci-fi...
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
Little Fish is a sad romance filled with so much amazing emotion it's impossible to forget it.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
The understated, internalised filmmaking gives each scene a remarkable intimacy, pulling us in further.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
Cooke and O'Connell both give strong performances, conveying the emotions of this devoted couple as they face the end of the world and the end of their connection at the same time.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
Cooke is marvelous. She carries this movie through all of its various ups and downs with magnetic grace.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
It traverses the romantic territory between ""wistful"" and ""grieving,"" with a few gentle punches and a couple of shots straight to the gut.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
Though this is not a ""wow"" film it is a solid one. Every element within is good providing a good foundation to get the story across.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
In the midst of a flurry of pandemic-themed media coming out which tries to reflect the [present] situation, LITTLE FISH manages to distinguish itself from the crowd with its brilliant leads and emotional resonance.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
Maybe that's the greatest surprise of the movie, after all: Obsessed though it is with the past, throughout its whole runtime, the best part always lies ahead.
 "
Little Fish,91,77,critic,"
... it's a small film filled with nuance and delicacy, and it feels authentic because of those choices.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,audience,"It's understandable that the movie has mixed reviews. The subject matter is offputting, the main character is pretty morally reprehensible & certain scenes are just uncomfortable to watch. That said, there's a lot of good visual storytelling, the performances are all super believable & I found it impressive how good the production quality is considering the small budget. I think its definitely worth a watch."
PVT Chat,65,50,audience,"Great to see a movie about the sex industry that isn't just ""awwww poor exploited woman."" Look this might not be something feminists like but generally in this industry, the women hold the power and benefit from it, and it's usually the men who are exploited. It's refreshing to see a film that actually shows this even if the film overall is quite depressing and bland."
PVT Chat,65,50,audience,"Over the last few years, New York City duo Josh Safdie and younger brother Benny Safdie have created their own niche brand of crime-thriller films. Most notably with 2017's Good Time and 2019's Uncut Gems. Both films are highly celebrated among critics and fans alike with the general consensus that the brotherly duo can expertly craft drama, comedy and crime whilst simultaneously creating of the most anxiety-inducing cinema in recent memory.

In the wake of the immense success of Uncut Gems comes a new film that could fit within the same high-intensity realm, from independent filmmaker and lead guitarist/singer of NYC art punk/post-punk band Bodega, Ben Hozie.

Credited as ""A romance about freedom, fantasy, death and friendship"", starring Peter Vack, and Safdie Bros. alumni, Julia Fox and Buddy Duress, PVT Chat focuses on an internet gambler living in NYC who becomes fixated on a cam girl he meets online. His obsession reaches boiling point when fantasy materialises in reality and he believe he spots her on the streets of Manhattan.

With its gritty, hand-held documentary-like approach to filming, PVT Chat showcases the mundane and isolated day-to-day life of online gambling addict, Jack (Vack). Sexually frustrated and looking for human interaction; the human touch, Jack frequents online sex chatrooms. During his interactions he meets Scarlet (Fox), a dominatrix claiming to live in San Francisco.

As part of her online work, Scarlet makes Jack her ""slave"" throughout the course of their online escapades, forcing him to be submissive and humiliate himself for his sexual gratification. Jack will mimic cigarettes being put out onto his tongue, pretend to inhale second-hand smoke puffed by Scarlet through the screen and even spank himself, all at Scarlet's demand. And in due course, Jack puts an actual cigarette out onto his tongue and it's 100% real folks, no special effects or camera trickery. Speaking from personal experience, I've done that once before as a dare and believe me, it ain't fun. Vack has some big cojones to really immerse himself into the character and the mindset of somebody who's a slut for punishment!

Jack quickly becomes infatuated with Scarlet, lying about his position in life to appeal more desirable not just to her but to the world. And in a stroke of luck, he believes he notices her one night whilst walking the streets of Manhattan. To her bemusement, Scarlet challenges Jack to take photo of her alleged doppelgänger. Jack decides to makes a deal with Scarlet, if he can get photographic evidence of her in NYC, she must accompany him on a romantic trip to Paris.

Taking many twists and turns throughout its 76-minute runtime, PVT Chat has the same level of sheer force that its [Safdie] contemporaries wield: the ability to grab a hold of your throat and squeeze until there's no breath left in you.

Peter Vack sets a career-best as ""Blackjack Jack"". Having recently loss his room-mate and close friend, behind on paying landlord rent but happy to spend hundreds of dollars on sex chatrooms, Jack leads a very bleak and depressing life. Whilst complicit in lying to Scarlet about his ""big tech-creating opportunity"", he'll cook himself instant noodles in his largely unfurnished, crummy NYC apartment. The desperation and longing for companionship is a deeply sad affair to watch.

Jack's obsessive crusade to prove that Scarlet lives in NYC and not San Francisco brings a Taxi Driver/The King of Comedy quality to PVT Chat. During the scene where he believes he spots Scarlet in the streets of Chinatown and the fanatical stalking begins, everything down to the shaky, (sometimes) first-person camera work is the epitome of that Scorsese, NYC grimy-type thriller.

In equal parts alluring and infuriating, Fox steals the show! Whenever Scarlet is on-screen, your eyes are laser-focused towards her. She's bedazzling. Like Jack, you're desperate to understand more about her and her shtick. Being a cam girl who prefers to keep her personal life more private, viewers are spoon-fed small mouthfuls about her to begin with, causing deep frustration of this elusive and desirable woman. The more the film progresses and her and Jack's relationship begins to blossom, viewers are eventually rewarded with ever so slightly bigger mouthfuls of information on Scarlet's background. However the more you learn, the less you wish to know. Her day-to-day life off-cam is equally as dejected as Jack's. Without giving away any spoilers, one gut-wrenching quote from Scarlet that – to me sums up her quality of life, is, ""I make us money so you can do your thing"".

In early 2020, Fox spoke with The Hollywood Reporter on being a real-life dominatrix for a six-month stint. ""Then I got into the sex industry pretty young, doing S&M stuff"". ""Officially the job title was 'dominatrix'"". ""I had heard about another girl who was doing it and there was no sex and no nudity. It was all role-playing"". With that level of genuine experience, newcomer and Uncut Gems sensation silences any noise that may have doubted her star potential. She's the real deal in Hozie's film!

Unlike a Scorsese or Safdie Bros. flick, Hozie's film focuses (a lot) less on crime and more on themes or loneliness, isolation, obsession and erotica. At its core, PVT Chat is a film about two people who long for intimacy in two completely different capacities. Jack is a sleazy loner with a compulsion to lie in order to make himself appear more admirable. Scarlet is a confident, predatory sex worker, displaying the darker side to online sex work whilst still being just as desperate as Jack to to link with people on a much deeper level. And its very pure, humane story of love, bonding and loss couldn't be more on the nose than the unprecedented times we're living through with the global COVID-19 pandemic still running wild.

With online sex work becoming increasingly more popular, PVT Chat could serve as both a positive and a negative look on the psychology behind ""content creating"" as well as the potential dangers for ""content creators"" and ""content consumers"" all through a nihilistic lens."
PVT Chat,65,50,audience,"PVT Chat is a mumblecore drama that muddles its themes. Julia Fox was absolutely great. Peter Vack was also solid in his role. I liked the film’s low budget filmmaking. It made everything that happened feel more realistic. Sadly, the film just doesn’t add up to much. I felt very passive while watching it. It felt like I’m the film didn’t know best how to convey its themes. After it all ended I just felt empty and that I didn’t get much out of it. The film is also very graphic. That’s not a positive or a negative, just a heads up. Overall, this was a mixed bag. There are plenty of admirable parts but it just didn’t add to much. I can definitely say I can’t wait to see what Julia Fox does next. She’s very talented, and I hope she gets bigger roles in the future. "
PVT Chat,65,50,audience,"Really great film. Raw, gritty and textural - the low budget feeling adds to the film's effect and Peter and Julia are spectacular. While the characters live in this distorted online fantasy world, what shines through is the honesty of their desires. Feels like a different type of romantic comedy based in reality rather than standard romcom or indie movie tropes. It feels true, like real life. Some laugh out loud moments as well as heartfelt moments of intimacy. Definite must see!"
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
Director Ben Hozie's graphic dive into the world of the online sex industry showcases our human need to connect with others-fetishes and all
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
This is a film which begins in frenetic disarray and concludes with the same degree of uncertainty. Meet cutes have rarely been this visceral or financially dependent, yet somehow PVT Chat not only makes it work, but builds into a film of substance.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
What the film does successfully is explore the facets and types of relationships that can blossom with internet culture.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
Happily, this as much a source of humour for them as it is for the viewer.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
The film's rough energy is a virtue, and there's plenty of it in Julia Fox's performance as an online dominatrix who captivates Jack. But Hozie's efforts to say something about modern romance could have used more discipline.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
It's kind of gross, but you won't be able to take your eyes off of it.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
Further proof that Julia Fox is an absolute star, even if writer/director Ben Hozie's genuinely fascinating exploration of the transactional nature of modern interpersonal relationships winds up undone by a messy third act.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
With a little more nuance and less style, PVT Chat could have been an excellent examination on social relationships within the digital age of the internet, but it suffers from an undercooked story.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
Its independent spirit shines through gloriously, reminding the viewer that, really, a decent story and some talented actors is all that's required to make a movie.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
It's a film with a slackerish mumblecore vibe, and Hozie is refreshingly grown up about sex. But it's hard to see how his film adds much to the conversation about intimacy in the internet age.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
""PVT Chat"" is at its best when it delves into the intensity of digital relationships and the ways our minds can trick us into believing the deepness of a connection formed over a computer screen.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
While PVT Chat has all the ingredients necessary to entertain any man's sleaziest desires, the film shows a vested interest in transposing sexual gender roles and forgoing vapid misconceptions about sex work and agency.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
The movie ends up feeling like an older vintage of New York story, the kind of pre-gentrification indie you expect a youthful Jim Jarmusch to wander through.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
Visceral and uncompromising in its vision, PVT Chat etches a gritty portrait of eroticism in the digital age with great nuance and authenticity.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
Far from being a sexually liberating film, it's actually very unimaginative and narrow-minded that writer/director [Ben] Hozie chose to not put any women in this movie in any context except to be sexually in service to a thoughtless lowlife.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
PVT Chat is a wild experience and a fantastic independent film.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
The film fizzles out when it flips perspectives, falling into a caper that feels like Safdie Brothers-lite.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
Hozie creates an old-school Scorsese and Ferrara-like portrait of a grubby New York, where everyone seems to be bartering for something, and he gets fearless, naked (figuratively and literally) performances out of both Fox and Vack.
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
This is a sexy, provocative, and timely statement - it plays like a 21st century Last Tango In Paris
 "
PVT Chat,65,50,critic,"
With Julia Fox in the driver seat, there's plenty worth talking about.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,audience,A poignant and personal look at how the civil rights movement of the early 1960s prompted a young white Alabaman to recognize his own humanity and act on it. This film could serve as a good start for those seeking to learn about the movement.
Son of the South,54,91,audience,"Son of the South is inspirational and engaging, a story that holds weight today.  As noted by Rosa Parks within the movie, ""...we all have a choice to make, not choosing is also a choice.""  Poignant movie, excellent characters."
Son of the South,54,91,audience,"Deeply inspiring.  
An unfortunate truth of racism in America is that illogical malevolence gives rise to conspicuous gallantry.  
Would the Freedom Riders been as successful without white allies?  
Would Bob Zellner's sleeping inner-activist been roused by another cause?  
We don't know.  
What we do know that the empathy shown by Bob and people of his ilk to love their fellow humans is the blueprint for society.    

There's a certain nobility that comes from voluntary risk taking.  
The white American civil rights ally is a special monster.  
Loving; fierce, resilient and obviously noteworthy.  

See this movie.  See this movie again.  

And answer the question.  
What side are you on?"
Son of the South,54,91,audience,Awesome! A MUST see for all! Be the change we want to live 🤍
Son of the South,54,91,audience,"I enjoyed the movie.  I have already watched it twice and am encouraging everyone I see to watch it.  The message is so simple, be an ally and share your privileges with others."
Son of the South,54,91,audience,Amazing story based on such important work in our counties history!
Son of the South,54,91,audience,"It was a wonderful movie dealing with things we are still dealing with today. Lucas Till was superb in the lead role. Already bought the movie, watched it with my son and had a wonderful discussion as to what went on in our history"
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
There is nothing particularly new about its narrative or flashy in its production, but it tells its story well and conveys its importance without being moralistic.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
Civil Rights biopic of White ally has racist crimes, slurs.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
Lucas Till is the main reason to watch this story. The total film is only mildly interesting in the way it is presented.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
It never makes the case that a movie about Bob Zellner is intriguing let alone necessary
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
While its intentions are pure, like its protagonist, this historical drama is too didactic and heavy-handed to provide much meaningful insight into its true-life subject matter.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
The fight for equality isn't over, and this story is as relevant today...
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
A movie that misses the point of what the civil rights movement was about.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
Confrontations, riots, plus [Bob] Zellner's recollection of his own weak moments when he couldn't muster the courage to protest illuminate the historical significance of that era as well as the timeliness of the story.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
Executive produced by Spike Lee, Barry Alexander Brown's drama features fine performances across the board, and a vivid evocation of a tumultuous period.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
A massive failure on the part of Bob Zellner and those whose stories got weaved into this cheesy after school special. They deserved better.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
For all its noble intentions ... Son of the South never quite figures out its purpose.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
A pretty old-fashioned, unimaginative contribution to the filmography on the civil rights struggle, but it's earnest and instructive, and a tribute to one of its unsung heroes.
 "
Son of the South,54,91,critic,"
Accepted on its terms, the film does a reasonably absorbing job of dramatizing how Zellner's convictions strengthened, pulling him away from the security of inaction.
 "
The Right One,40,74,audience,The film is an unexpected and refreshing twist on the rom-com format. It's about the power of friendship and forming genuine connections with each other. I enjoyed this feel-good movie with its fun and engaging characters
The Right One,40,74,audience,"If I could give it a 0, I would. The characters are unloveable, have no on-screen chemistry, and you never really get into the movie. It is advertised as a Rom Com, but it's not, and the entire film feels superficial and amateurish."
The Right One,40,74,audience,"""The Right One"" had so much potential but was squandered. Plot was all over the place and demanded more depth. No true progress was made with any of our characters and it felt like we were chasing our tails for an hour and a half. Casting was interesting and actors did well with what little they had. Cleopatra Coleman plays a selfish and shallow woman who doesnt have control of her life. Coleman's facial acting made her actual lines barable for the most part. Nick Thune was a fresh face to me and did well with what he was dealt. Felt like I sat down for a highly anticipated meal and walked away with food poisoning. So disappointed!"
The Right One,40,74,audience,This movie was entertaining and fun to watch. It wasn't your typical Rom Com where everything is so predictable. The characters are interesting and very likable. My husband who has never watched a rom com with me actually came in and started watching. We both enjoyed it!
The Right One,40,74,audience,"A fun rom-com that also reminds us to find our authentic selves, no matter what that might look like, to open up to the truest form of love. A much needed dose of positive vibes esp as we persevere thru these very troubled season."
The Right One,40,74,audience,"This is a fun, feel-good film, the perfect pick-me-up when you want to laugh and be entertained. Cleopatra Coleman is charming as a writer looking for love and trying to overcome her writer's block, while Llisa Shlesinger is hilarious as her disapproving agent. Loved it!"
The Right One,40,74,audience,"Not what I expected! This is a heartfelt movie that addresses grief and mental illness - something we do not see enough of on screen! It is funny and all around entertaining. Iliza Shlesinger is hilarious. Highly recommend (but be warned: it is not a rom-com. It is a touching friend-com. The only thing I didn't understand is why it got an ""R"" rating. A-score from my wife, 3 teenagers and me"
The Right One,40,74,audience,"A completely unexpected, unpredictable and truly adorable film. Performances (yes, plural) from Nick Thune were so fresh and entertaining. Each personality felt authentic and soulful. There were moments where I found myself laughing at something outrageous, thank you Iliza Shlesinger, and others when I was trying not to cry (okay, I did actually cry). The elements of comedy and drama blended so seamlessly throughout the film and kept you engaged every step of the way. I felt so invested and cared so much for the characters in this film, kudos to the writing and casting because that is not an easy thing to achieve. Overall, I loved this film for its original feel, humor, warmth and message about life after grief. The Right One is a rare gem and definitely a must see."
The Right One,40,74,audience,Definitely a feel good movie. Made me laugh and think. I really liked the fact that a man and a woman don't have to sleep together to have a meaningful relationship.
The Right One,40,74,audience,I don't usually watch rom coms but it was actually interesting and I really liked the woman who played Kelly. She was hysterical.
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
Clumsy romance addresses mental health; swearing, sex.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
Even without the ridiculous and offensive way that mental illness is handled in The Right One, the movie fails to meet the basic requirement of a romantic comedy: believable chemistry between the would-be couple.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
An okay semi-serious romcom that is elevated by a bright and sparkling performance by rising star Cleopatra Coleman
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
Godfrey is more off-putting than endearing, and the stars have no chemistry together.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
This parade of quirky and detached artistic types generates some scattered laughs, but the screenplay stumbles when transitioning into a more serious examination of depression and grief.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
The plot strains to tell us why Godfrey can't simply be himself. All of this amounts to little, aside from providing each actor with an opportunity to showcase something...
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
The Right One proves to be the right movie for our still rocky times.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
Like its main character, it has a rakish, if amateurish charm.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
The character of Godfrey could have been so much more and possibly should have been the central one with an important message about mental health in men and how it's often approached without delving deep enough just like in this film.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
Never lands on the ""right"" anything.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
Almost totally wrongheaded... [It] might have worked as either a screwball comedy or a heartfelt drama about grief. By trying to be both, it succeeds as neither.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
While it does not break new ground, this rom-com takes on grief better than most films of the genre. Nick Thune gives a wonderful performance.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
""The Right One"" is being sold as a good time, but it's not, gradually becoming melodramatic mush as the helmer fails to mix the light and substantial darkness of the material in any meaningful way.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
Add the fact that it's the tamest R-rated romantic comedy in the history of motion pictures to its gloomy pauses and funereal pace and you haven't got a rom-com on your hands, just a rom-corpse.
 "
The Right One,40,74,critic,"
A brilliant film that offers a unique take on dealing with loss and grief.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
A daring debut film that shows a raw and realistic view of the American porn industry. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
Kappel is not really a compelling enough actor to carry the film and there are gaps in the writing that would have lent more interest to the story eg. we learn nothing about Bella's backstory in Sweden and what made her want to make this move to LA.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
Writer-director Ninja Thyberg explores questions of complicity and consent in the face of fierce coercion.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
A frank and difficult watch that tackles the adult film industry. Spontaneous and engaging. Kappel is fantastic in a role that requires a range of emotions.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
More than just the mere sum of its most explicit scenes, Pleasure gets under your skin and stays there long after the initial visceral reactions wear off.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
One of the best directed films of [Sundance 2021]. Thyberg is a real discovery.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
Instead of a character study, or titillation, the director goes for discomfort.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
Ninja Thyberg's LA porn drama, Pleasure, is an authentic, scathing look at an industry with little regard for boundaries or consent
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
A stunning indictment of an industry filled to the brims in male domination. This is a great, shocking movie.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
The prize for preachy provocation goes to Pleasure, an art-house harangue...
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
Thyberg has created a film that can be difficult to watch but is so mesmerizing that it can also be hard to look away from. Pleasure is simply a standout exercise in filmmaking.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
Pleasure is explicit, devastating, and authentic. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
Kappel's jaw-dropping and fearless performance blurs fiction and reality.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
""Ninja Thyberg's keen sense of direction and her ability to bring the viewer into the space is extremely effective, making it so hard to look away.""
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
A full-frontal provocation that demystifies pornography...what starts off as a harrowing peek into the industry turns into a damning portrayal of the cycle of abuse.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
Pleasure is as discomforting a portrait of the modern porn industry as it is a candid and empathetic one. In an unforgettable acting debut, Sofia Kappel is nothing short of hypnotic.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
Astonishingly audacious and astoundingly responsible.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
When it was all done, I kind of found myself at a loss as to what it was trying to do, other than try to see how much adult content can be put into a film before it is considered to be pornographic itself.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
It preemptively deflates the argument that the industry has safety nets in place by dissecting how legal protocols do more to shield the (mostly male) higher-ups from liability than the women from trauma.
 "
Pleasure,91,,critic,"
Thyberg doesn't shy away from the specifics of her milieu, but it's not an exposé on what pornography does to women as much as a harrowing examination of what the workplace expects and allows from women and men.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
[Sparks] music and the style of [Edgar Wright's] filmmaking creates this wonderful marriage of the two.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
With Wright's first foray into non-fiction filmmaking the director has crafted a lengthy yet loving portrait of the duo.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
The enjoyable film follows the brotherly act through many decades and several different reinventions of their music and features a long list of celebrity talking heads
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
Edgar Wright has made a smart, dynamic and definitive documentary about Ron and Russell Mael, brothers and founding members of the band Sparks.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
By the time Wright's somewhat exhaustive film concluded, every moment of it propelled by a high-octane geeky affection that felt like a newly discovered alternative fuel, I was in the strange duo's thrall.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
Wright doesn't try to reinvent the documentary form, but draws on the Maels' energy, matching their playfulness and incorporating both stop-motion and a decoupage styles of animation into their back story.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
Wright's film is marked by the same virtues that embodied Sparks themselves: it's a shape-shifting beast with a winning sense of humour.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
This tribute by a self-described fanboy will be a great introduction to the band for many, and a nudge into full-blown obsession for people like me who've loved an album or two but never knew the whole story.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
[L]ike the Maels' tumultuous legacy, it still feels mostly like a (very bumpy) success.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
A mighty convincing recommendation to start listening to Sparks.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
As endearingly, fawningly nerdy as you'd expect an Edgar Wright-directed documentary about Sparks to be...The Sparks Brothers is an essential, playful encapsulation of the band's rich, dynamic history whether you're a fan or not.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
The average music fan might will come away from The Sparks Brothers with an appreciation of who they are, where they came from, and why we should care.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
By the time the credits roll on The Sparks Brothers, the band will surely have found themselves a new generation of fans.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
Edgar Wright's sheer enthusiasm means that the two and half hours doesn't feel excessive at all: he powers chronologically through a pop survival story that has you wanting to punch the air
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
Edgar Wright pays long overdue homage with The Sparks Brothers, a documentary that's light on dirt and heavy on fanboying, but if you don't come away from it downloading at least one or two tracks from Sparks' discography, you're beyond help.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
The Sparks Brothers runs a whopping two hours and 15 minutes, though it feels as fleet as a three-minute pop song.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
It's hard not to be a newly minted Sparks super fan by the time the credits roll.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
Edgar Wright's lively ""The Sparks Brothers"" is consistently engaging for the uneducated in the room (I can only imagine how it connects for those who grew up loving the band. It's probably Nirvana).
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
If you're a fan of Sparks, or even if you've never heard of Sparks before but are a fan of Edgar Wright, you should absolutely check out this funny, heartwarming, and thorough documentation of Sparks' career.
 "
The Sparks Brothers,100,,critic,"
A worthwhile endeavor for anyone wanting a little more absurdity in their pop music.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
The beats are a mostly predictable and standard for the coming-of-age story, but they're pulled off competently, which is more than enough for a charming debut film.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
Marvelous is enchanting and quirky. It's a decent show for Tsang's debut feature film and a strong performance from the lead Mia Cech.

Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
Funny without being forced, and sincere without being schlocky, Marvelous is guaranteed to warm the hearts of wannabe baby goths everywhere.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
A testament to director Kate Tsang and the incredible work that she did in bringing this story to life.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
The kind of movie where all that its defenders, myself included, can really say for it is, 'Aw, come on, it's cute!'
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
Marvelous and the Black Hole is quirky and a little punky and a lot of fun, a movie that treats teen girls - even the angry ones - as deserving of respect.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
Through all this, Tsang builds to a beautiful ending about the power of love and family, making her mark in a crowded genre.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
Teenage anger and teenage coping mechanisms finally get their due in this sensitive and charming film
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
A beautiful story of unlikely friends [...] who help each other deal with grief, anger, and family issues through the whimsical lens of stage magic.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
You don't have to be wholly convinced by the film to take pleasure in its faith that most anything can be solved with sincerity, storytelling and some very slight sleight.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
Marvelous and the Black Hole never unwraps from its dissection of grief, but still offers a joyous backbone that serves its narrative well. The film will leave you feeling emotionally fulfilled and is a poignant example of how magical cinema can be.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
What separates Marvelous and the Black Hole from so much cutesy stuff in this genre are the characters that Tsang has created, and her direction of the right actors in the right roles.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
The played-out narrative road map isn't imbued with enough emotion or wit to sustain the experience.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
Sammy and Patricia tussle and yell with sheer physicality, occupying space in a way that young Chinese American women aren't normally afforded in American media.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
The central story is not groundbreaking in any way, but the unique style and amount of love that has been poured into it still makes it a fulfilling experience.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
A wholly sincere crowd-pleaser with bursts of inspired comedy, with only its familiarity striking as a major flaw.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
It wants to be something cute for the family. It also wants to show how belligerent and vulgar young teenagers can be. The problem is that the two never intersect.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
This offbeat comedy comes close to overdosing on its sweetness but knows when to pull back in just the right moments.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
Marvelous and the Black Hole has a huge heart anyone with teenagers or who has been a teenager will enjoy.
 "
Marvelous and the Black Hole,89,,critic,"
Incredibly moving.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
A multiple genre film that's oversaturated with violence, gruesome kills, and an unhinged Nicolas Cage. It's crazy fun, just not my type of fun.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
PRISONERS OF THE GHOSTLAND is a wild and tempestuous ride on a ghost galleon where the forces of the seas of the surreal and the absurd clash for supremacy over the soul of mankind. Seriously.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
[Prisoners of the Ghostland] works best as a kitschy pleasure.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
Like a lot of Nicolas Cage movies, Prisoners of the Ghostland is full of Awesome Things ... and yet somehow it's still kind of boring.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
The ensuing story is nothing short of pure adrenaline cinema, grabbing you by the short and curlies while dazzling you with the grand and absurd.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
Prisoners of the Ghostland is a total blast; a dystopian East-meets-West culture clash that had me howling in its oddball feel; complete with numerous idiosyncratic touches that awash the well-worn plot. Cage and Sono are a match made in heaven.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
Yeah, there are flaws and lots of them--but the film is still a wild ride worth taking.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
A hot mess of throwback tropes, leaning heavily on an Escape from New York setup and evocative of Mad Max's junkyard fashions and Terry Gilliam's multidimensional fever dreams...it's all too much.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
If you give yourself over to this thing, it's a neon-lit ride worth taking.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
It is exactly the kind of haute trash you would expect from a Sion Sono-Nicolas Cage collaboration. To paint the movie in words is like trying to instil it with meaning and coherence to which it doesn't really aspire.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
There's no other way to say it, except: if you're a fan of the bold and outrageous, get on board with Prisoners of the Ghostland, and hold the F on.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
It's a wild and bats--- feast for the eyes, though you probably shouldn't expect too much more out of it than the good time you're definitely going to have.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
Sion Sono's arguably got something to say here - he usually does - but his themes are typically far more successful when paired with more entertaining and/or thoughtful fare.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
Prisoners of the Ghostland knows exactly what it is, but that may not necessarily be a good thing.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
This gonzo goulash is strictly heterogenous and, despite some novel production value, often ends up feeling more like a chore than an adventurous odyssey into the forbidden zone.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
I didn't hate it. It just made me tired.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
The excess of Prisoners of the Ghostland has the discipline of an experienced filmmaker like Sono, paradoxically it is not perceived as saturated despite its delusional plot and structure.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
Prisoners of the Ghostland, starring a whacked-out Nicholas Cage, is exciting, wild, bold, and joyfully ridiculous -- pretty much what you expect from a Sion Sono film.
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
Sono seems to be making that argument that, if given a chance to make a movie, why not squeeze everything out of that chance that you can?
 "
Prisoners of the Ghostland,75,,critic,"
Prisoners of the Ghostland is just a hodgepodge of random ideas that never come together.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Flee tells a universal story of looking for a place to belong through an intrinsically minority perspective.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
A fascinating documentary that pushes new boundaries and takes us through a heartbreaking journey to redefine the meaning of family, home and belonging. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Fantastically directed, this gut-wrenching story is told in a unique and visually stirring way that makes it an essential watch for all.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
A captivating documentary, from start-to-start to finish. The animation really works as a way of conveying frequently traumatic memories. It reflects the mind of Amin, who is telling his story, because the earlier the memories, the hazier the outlines.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Beautifully animated to protect the identity of the main subject, Rasmussen's film examines the lengths we will go to in order to survive and protect those we love.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
The accounts of the clandestine crossings are expertly paced, making Flee perhaps the most suspenseful film of 2021.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Seems destined to go down as one of the best documentaries of the year, one of the best animated features, and one of the best foreign-language films.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Innovative doc filmmaking. Impressive visuals. A very personal and harrowing story laid bare.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Flee won the World Cinema Documentary Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, and no wonder: It's heartbreaking and moving, and hard to forget.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Rasmussen uses two very different styles of animation to illuminate the unthinkably hard years the narrator endured, and the emotional pain he's just beginning to process as he speaks about a background he's hidden from almost everyone
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
In its abstractions, animation offers the perfect device to piece together the traumatised workings of a fractured consciousness, especially from a distance of 20 years.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
A feat of humanistic filmmaking, this is a movie we will be celebrating all through next year's awards season and talking about long after.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
It (also) boasts one of the most surprising reactions by a brother discovering his sib is gay that I've witnessed.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
The film is so grounded in Amin's perspective that it manages to include the kind of details that more tone-moderated documentaries and realistic narratives excise, and it also allows for a greater range of emotions to be present in the film.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
With great resourcefulness, Rasmussen puts you through it in a way that illustrates, instructs, makes you look inward and ask whether you'd have what it takes, if you could tough it out and survive in a cold, hostile world.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Innovative and visually dynamic... The animation renders his fond childhood memories with painterly grace, and turns his darkest hours into nightmarish horrors.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Jonas Poher Rasmussen's Flee, a harrowing chronicle of a refugee's journey to start a new life, bends the boundaries of documentary to craft a gripping story brimming with tension and haunting us long after the film ends.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Without the closeness, the openness and ease that comes with a level of trust developed over many years, Flee would not have been possible, let alone be as affecting as the final result turns out to be.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Etched without a false note of cynicism or falling into cheap sentimentality, ""Flee"" harnesses the animated medium in stunning form.
 "
Flee,100,,critic,"
Flee is a terrific case for the power of well-told personal narrative -- the challenges of the refugee, the police-profiled, the closeted queer is explained without ambiguity.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
Coming Home in the Dark is a stellar thriller. Writer-director James Ashcroft is unafraid to push the boundaries of this gritty crime film.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
Look past the veneer of torture porn on this one and you just might find some meaning in its relentless noir.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
Wallows in misery and cruelty without any payoff or satisfaction.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
A nasty and horrifying midnight noir.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
Impactful decisions early on, strong performances, and masterful use of tension help lift the film. However, it's not always enough to hide its plot holes.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
Thinking about a family hiking trip? You might forgo that after being scared to death by this relentless thriller.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
What starts out as a nerve-rattling portrait of chance violence becomes a dark meditation on the long-term reverberations of childhood abuse in state institutions.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
I had some hope that there was a point to the carnage, but, alas, this was just another glorification of violence.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
Gillies turns in a gleefully evil performance, and though his work initially appears to be the flippancy of a garden-variety psychopath, it reveals itself to be something deeper and more painful as the film rolls on.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
Its torture-porn trappings give way to a moral weight as unanticipated by the characters as it is by the audience.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
Coming Home In the Dark is a white knuckle ride of ruthless horror.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
A tensely thrilling ride pairing cruel behaviors with an inviting landscape, and it's not for the faint of heart.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
A much smarter suspense thriller than we are used to that catches all of the moments just right.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
First-time director James Ashcroft uses his theatre background to tell an intimate, terror driven story that keeps the human drama in focus and firmly in the headlights.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
Beyond the empty style and emptier sadism, though, there is simply nothing going on here to justify either the cruelties or the pretensions on display.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
Brutal and tense enough to overcome the bare bones storytelling and a sense of familiarity, it's an impressive debut.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
The film doesn't flinch from the premise that revenge must be enacted, instead chewing on the nuances of how and by whom it should be carried out, simply bringing viewers along for the ride.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
It grabs you by the nose hairs and pulls each one with twist after twist in the storyline.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
There's more shock than genuine surprises, but as a piece of midnight cinema, tailor-made for a group of friends at a drive-in during a cool summer night, Coming Home in the Dark meets the mark.
 "
Coming Home in the Dark,86,,critic,"
While Coming Home in the Dark doesn't bring anything new to the thriller genre, it is an anxiety-inducing mean and lean entry that is the perfect kind of Midnight screening at Sundance 2021.
 "
Minari,98,91,audience,"this film was so interesting... the acting was fabulous all the way around, especially little David, and the music was incredible.  i wish the movie had ended with some lose ends tied, but nevertheless, it was a heartwarming experience."
Minari,98,91,audience,"If you want to live the American dream, this will squash your aspirations."
Minari,98,91,audience,"I liked the first half hour then the movie just stalls. It is horribly boring and you want to scream at the screen to ""get a move on"" and do something . Just a overrated made for TV movie. Don't trust the audience unless you like watching paint dry."
Minari,98,91,audience,"Pretty good character film about a Korean-American family that moves to Arkansas and tries to start their own farm...  The cast is really good and it has a nice slice of life feel to it.. Production values also quite good here. The story is a bit slow, but the performances make this worth a watch."
Minari,98,91,audience,"The film is beautiful and touching.

To me, it was a perfect representation of this clash of cultures and different lifestyles and traditions trying to fit in a society so wide and imposing. The struggles represented by this Korean family arriving in 1980 America felt relatable and natural, with every emotion portrayed so subtly, and this goes for all the cast.

Technically magnificent. The art direction makes you want to go back to the '80s, not to mention the photography and the beautiful score by Emile Mosseri."
Minari,98,91,audience,"""Minari"" is a simple and beautiful portrait of the American Dream. I thought this movie felt very real and authentic which worked for the story it was trying to tell. All of the characters in this movie felt like actual people and the conflicts they faced were more everyday struggles but were nonetheless engaging to watch. The film does have a few emotional moments but there is an optimistic tone that left me with a great feeling. I also thought the movie was directed very well and was boosted by an effective score. Overall, this is a drama that I think the world can use right now and if you come from an immigrant family in any way shape, or form, there is something in this movie that will likely connect with you, because it certainly did in multiple places for me."
Minari,98,91,audience,"A surprisingly heart warming and realistic depiction of the struggles of an immigrant family.

It starts to look like award season, and continuing the trend of foreign movies making their way to the most prestigious awards we have yet another quality Korean speaking movie (an American production however) this year, this time a semi auto-biography of director Lee Isaac Chung, an American national born of South Korean immigrants.

The premise of the movie is pretty simple, it depicts a Korean family of immigrants that move to the countryside of Arkansas, and their financial struggle while they try to make a living in what has been an historically rough country for immigration. The themes depicted here can be drill down to the sacrifices that are made, when it comes to a healthy family relationship versus the time spent working away, to make sure that everyone has food on the table.

This is where the movie excels, the family dynamic between father, mother, their son and daughter and later the grandmother is incredibly organic and natural, it's very realistic there's no overly dramatic scenes nor lack of connection between them, it's your everyday family trying to survive in tough environment while also working hard to stick together through all the bad.
All performances are on point, special compliment to Steven Yeun, Youn Yuh-jung (the grandmother) and of course the son, Alan S.Kim - amazing!

It's a touching story which seems to have come from the director's personal experience, and it has a beautiful ending, without ruining it, let's just say it shows where the real essence in life lies, and that the real gains most of the times are right in front of us, we need only to value them.
I hope it gets the recognition it deserves on the coming Oscars, and I am continuing to be glad to watch audiences slowly moving away from traditional Hollywood American movies, it's good that mainstream awards are helping build that path."
Minari,98,91,audience,"A carefully written and produced, moving and beautiful narrative.  The acting was superb - particularly by the son and the grandmother.  If you're looking for a lovely story enhanced by a wonderful screenplay featuring a nearly total Asian acting cast, this movie is for you."
Minari,98,91,audience,it was a great movie but lots of reading and a bit sad.
Minari,98,91,audience,"Minari Roots Deeply Planted in Resilience of Korean Family: Written and directed by Lee Issac Chung, ""Minari"" follows the Yi family, Jacob, Monica, their 2 children Anne and David and maternal Grandmother, Korean immigrants seeking to live their dream in 1980's America, when father Jacob buys land and moves them all to rural Arkansas to start a farm and garden growing Korean vegetables for wholesale market. The struggles and challenges they face in achieving the dream creates friction, but ultimately strengthens their bond as a family. Simple, relatable story, the film is beautifully shot and the acting from the cast is flawless."
Minari,98,91,critic,"
Unfussy and unassuming.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
For the locals the Koreans might just as well be Martians, but to be accepted the Yis must avoid taking offence.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
Lee Isaac Chung's latest feature is beautiful examination of a Korean-American family's journey to make that dream a reality.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
The interaction between 8-year-old Alan Kim and 73-year-old Young Yuh-jung is one of the film's biggest strengths.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
The direction isn't showy; this is a movie carried by its story and by the stellar performances, including Yuh-jung Youn as the grandmother, Soonja.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
This is a tender, stripped-down account of growing up with parents who came to a new country not just to seek a better life, but to be born again.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
Slow-burning instead of hard-hitting, poignant rather than provocative, Minari stays with you in a completely different way.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
The picture's chief contribution, alongside some extremely subtle and acutely observed performances, is the consoling message that everyone is the same underneath. Films with that sort of one-size-fits-all sentiment tend not to linger.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
There is such depth, truth, and warmth to all of these people... Every choice here is beautiful and perfect.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
I love this beautiful movie.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
A tender and powerful story that portrays the struggles of a hard-working immigrant family in search of the so-called American dream. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
Maybe the American dream is just that, hope. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
Minari is a powerful look at the meaning of family, a thoughtful and heartfelt period piece that brings to light the many social, cultural and economic obstacles that rise up to interfere with the so-called American Dream.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
Minari carries the weight of representation, of helping us as Asian Americans validate ourselves through the hope that we will see our stories on screen and the hope that people will see us.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
Lee Isaac Chung delivers a treasure of a film, one that explores immigration, family, marriage and the hardships of reaching the American dream. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
Minari is a successful and tender look at a young family. A story we've seen on the screen so many teams before but via a palette that has long excluded people of color.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
A painfully melancholic film about the limbo those with hyphens in their identity must navigate, Minari is touched by magic.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
Powerful, moving and deeply introspective...passionately written and skillfully directed.
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
Another opportunity for us to see and experience someone else' American Dream...an intimate story you can settle in with...
 "
Minari,98,91,critic,"
It's warm and funny and heartbreaking at times, depicting a multigenerational family and the layers of perspective therein.
 "
Pelé,81,77,audience,I didn't finish it. IMO it became quite boring. But I'm not a big fan of football.
Pelé,81,77,audience,"This sports documentary was very good. The crew did a spectacular job on documenting everything about the soccer legend Pele and how he became not only a legend but a hero to his native country of Brazil. It gives you a deep insight into how Pele felt during his time as a soccer player and what he did to inspire a nation. If you're a Netflix member, you should definitely watch this documentary sometime. Even if you're not a soccer fan, you'll enjoy it."
Pelé,81,77,audience,"Such a beautiful and heartwarming documentary. Truly Beautiful to see how the beautiful game (football) is a part of Brazil's history. Pele stands as a footballing great, but not only that, Pele stands at being someone who inspired generations to come. Pele's name will go down in Brazil's history for ages. Such a good watch 10/10 would watch it again, especially if you love football!"
Pelé,81,77,audience,"A reminder for the self entitled prima donnas in today's game, this is what a footballing superstar looks like and at a fraction of the cost. Didn't buy into his disinterest in politics. He knew there would be consequences if he didn't play in the ‘70 final. He became a political pawn. He had no choice, as the majority of South America was pear shaped in that particular era. A footballer like no other. The greatest of all time."
Pelé,81,77,audience,"Es una lástima que el documental se quedará con Pelé y no con Edson. Me resultaba mucho más interesante la persona que el personaje. Esta muy bien enmarcado en la situación social de Brasil y muestra como el personaje de Pelé influyó en la historia del país. Sin embargo, poco deja ver de la persona y es una lástima porque la historia de Edson debe ser fascinante."
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
Do I wish that ""Pele"" had gone a little deeper? Yes...winning those three championships (still the only man to do it) - it was superhuman. Had we been able to get more of the merely human Pele, this documentary might have reached a greatness of its own.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
As it paints an honest portrait of the complex relationship between sports and politics in Brazil, Pelé suggests that the star transcended both.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
Pelé, the documentary, leaves us wanting more football... Otherwise, the documentary is inspiring and extremely moving. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
You'll be hard-pressed to find a subject as enthralling, human, or intrinsically linked to their culture and country as Pelé, and this documentary is a fitting tribute to that legacy.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
Pelé's contradictions are fascinating.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
Nicholas and Tryhorn's new film for Netflix, though plenty laudatory, presents a contemplative Pelé that appears human after all
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
A fitting tribute to both the man and the myth, unwilling to turn a blind eye to his shortcomings and yet perceptive enough to recognize that his failings were secondary to his athletic brilliance.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
Why the filmmakers couldn't get any vivd recollections out of Pelé, sitting in front of them, is anyone's guess.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
[Pelé's] story isn't as compellingly told as it could be and directors Ben Nicholas and David Tryhorn's efforts to examine the political turmoil of the era doesn't quite come off.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
The movie wanders into fascinating, uneasy areas.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
Pelé is a terrific examination of the player, the man, and his status in recent Brazilian history.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
As it's been said, what Pelé says matters less what than what he did on a soccer field. And this documentary is faithful testimony of that. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
A worthy look at one of the few athletes who could lay claim to the title of The Greatest Of All Time.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
As a tightly focused look on one man's influence and dominance of a global game for more than a decade, Pele is a more than entertaining watch.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
The digging is kept skin-deep and the protagonist gets off mostly unquestioned.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
However conventional as a whole, the movie feels troubled by the traumas of Pelé's heyday.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
On that level, Pelé is a relationship drama, but the torrid affair is between a nation's star player and the nation itself.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
Skillfully interweaves the story of the great man's rise with his country's turbulent politics.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
Watching clips of Pelé playing football is still out-of-this-world but this documentary has perhaps traded access to its subject for a too-cautious approach to examining his flaws.
 "
Pelé,81,77,critic,"
The archive footage is a thrilling testament to his talent. But the film also explores the dark side of the Brazilian nationalism he unwittingly unleashed.

Made You Look: A True Story About Fake Art,100,100,audience,"It really makes you wonder if the ""right"" people hold the power and prestige in this world. In person, these wealthy buyers probably wouldn't blink twice at the Spanish waitress in Brooklyn or the Chinese math teacher from Queens, but they looked upon their talent/cleverness as being worth millions.

I think the con itself is the true art in this particular case. Pei-Shen's fake pieces ought to be worth something for that alone."
Made You Look: A True Story About Fake Art,100,100,audience,"Fascinating true story about the high end art world through the lens of art dealers, collectors, critics, authenticators, lawyers and many more who were affected by an incredulous art con, carried out by the quiet unassuming Glafira Rosales.
More exciting than most documentaries, this one is filled with bright, educated people wondering how numerous fake paintings (imitation Rothko, Pollock, Motherwell and others) fooled virtually everybody, especially those who should have known better.  A bit of a mystery (Did she really know) and loads of fun to watch. You don't need to be an art world connoisseur to enjoy this well done, well edited, informative ""crime thriller""  Oh and by the way, in case you're wondering, it takes balls of steel to be in the art world. The main character dealer Ann Freedman truly has no shame whatsoever.
 The characters picked to comment on this undoing, such as Maria Konnikova who penned ""The Confidence Game"" shed delightful insights on how Ann continues to deny she knew the art was fake. And the most interesting, yet totally underrated character of all:  Glafira Rosales. Moral of the story. Crime doesn't pay. 
Also included big flashy rich people who were suckers for the fraud such as Sotheby's Chair Domenico De Sole and wife Eleanor, and Belgium hedge funder Pierre LaGrange. Call them extremely ticked off."

This smart, funny, and accessible film runs wild with an incredible story while unpacking the convoluted machinery of the art world that allowed its insiders to be woefully duped.

Made You Look: A True Story About Fake Art,100,100,critic,"
""Made You Look"" is a lively and fascinating stranger-than-fiction art-world doc, and what drives it are two essential mysteries: Who could have created fake paintings that looked this astonishing? And even then, how could all the experts have been fooled?

Through it all, the avarice of many becomes the central theme of Made You Look: A True Story About Fake Art. What's more the movie prompts the question, how gullible can one be? You may be surprised by the answer.

Young Hearts,63,,audience,This simply came down to really bad writing and acting. Really bad. Avoid this dreadfully bad movie like the plague.
Young Hearts,63,,audience,"Very well acted. Characters true to heart and realism. Dealt with issues of today. I may not agree politically on every issue, but I live true to my belief they have their constitutional right to their opinions."
Young Hearts,63,,critic,"
Like both of its main characters, this coming-of-age romance is sweet and unassuming, and unlikely to stand out from the crowd.

here's a genuine sense of familiar warmth throughout the film that's hard to describe -- it's almost like a time machine that makes you yearn for those youthful days again.
 "
Young Hearts,63,,critic,"
At its (very large) heart, this movie is about reminding us that high school romance is innocent, yes, but it also comes with difficulties. Dealing with those difficulties is part of the adolescent experience - an experience portrayed wonderfully here.
 "
Young Hearts,63,,critic,"
This heartfelt journey is worth going on; just be forewarned, tears might well up in your eyes during it.
 "
Young Hearts,63,,critic,"
The film's hand-held camerawork contributes to the amateur aesthetic. But what initially feels like a creative choice to capture adolescent authenticity quickly becomes painful.
 "
Young Hearts,63,,critic,"
Thunderbolt in Mine Eye captures the spirit of teenage angst, a refreshing narrative that celebrates the subtleties of an awkward era.

However hypnotic Ms. Azhar is, the movie nonetheless relies upon the chemistry between her and Liebling, and there isn't any.

Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
...helps to fill in some of what Ginsburg did before being appointed to the Supreme Court, as well as her accomplishments as a member of the Court.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
Although not as intimate or insightful as the Oscar-nominated 2018 documentary RBG, the documentary Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words can still be considered a worthy overview of the life and legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
There is a tendency to overly explain things as opposed to letting Ginsburg's words flow, but if you've enjoyed the previous looks at the notorious RBG, this is a new one offers a different angle to her remarkable story.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
Where it really shines is through its use of archival footage that -- as its title suggests -- allows Ginsburg to speak for herself in an attempt to answer its own thesis.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
It's easy to see Ruth possessing the most impact with future generations of schoolchildren who may not be as familiar with RBG's career as audiences in the present day.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
It is not so much the words that matter here as Justice Ginsburg's intellect, her ""consuming love"" for the law, her character, her kindness, her empathy, and her purpose.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
Writer-director Freida Lee Mock doesn't really break new ground -- as noted, it's been pretty well plowed -- but that doesn't prevent the tributes from feeling warm and heartfelt, especially coming after Ginsburg's death.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
[W]hile the film's impact is ever-so-slightly dulled by the outsized events that occurred between the conclusion of filming and the present, the talents of Mock and her team largely make up for it.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
Ruth - Justice Ginsburg In Her Own Words doesn't cover much new ground, but it's an absolutely gorgeously made and emotionally resonate documentary.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
It's curiously difficult to stay engaged with Mock's film that merely puts forth a paint-by-numbers assembly of the wealth of material it has at its disposal.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
Ruth - Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words is well-organized and gives the audience a look into the life of a woman who changes history.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
Little here will seem new to those who paid attention to Ginsburg's career or watched the Oscar-nominated documentary ""RBG."" But the director, Freida Lee Mock, repeatedly returns to the idea that change comes in steps.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
Mock's film employs archival film and audio footage of the late U.S. Supreme Court justice and her appearances at schools, receptions and in court, and is an air-tight testament to Ginsburg's wit, intellect and reasoning.
 "
Ruth: Justice Ginsburg in Her Own Words,93,,critic,"
The collage of footage past and present illustrates how Ginsburg's legacy is ongoing as she left rulings and dissents that will shape America's future...This doc feels somewhat more grounded, where the other evoked a portrait of a superhero...

Fake Famous,69,64,audience,"This would be akin to doing a movie on people who went on to become policemen, firemen and astronauts in the 1980s -- and we've seen how that turned out.
Nick Bilton has some things to say about influencers and, as a nearing-60-year-old man who is completely unaffected by these people (directly, anyway) I learned some things.
Most importantly, I think Bilton did, too."
Fake Famous,69,64,audience,Brilliant and terrifying.
Fake Famous,69,64,audience,"I found this film to be engaging in a disturbing and real way.  I honestly had no idea how fake the whole social media thing was, I knew it was not exactly real life, but not in the way that the film depicted it.  I was captivated from the beginning, I thought it was filmed in a real way, but in a way that kept me engaged and it was very thought provoking.  I was impressed with the way that the director handled the 3 different personalities, I found Dominique to be the most endearing and interesting of the 3.  It was also a beautiful film to look at and I enjoyed the way that the director talked right to us and narrated much of it.  Eye opening and a great informative film.  I would highly recommend."
Fake Famous,69,64,audience,Great Documentary!!!!!  I found it so interesting and learned so much about the influencer business and related industries.  I really enjoyed seeing how differently the 3 participants handled themselves through the project and found the photo shoot scenes very entertaining.  The interviews with the professionals in the industry were very informative and contributed to the film's credibility.   I think it is a must see for anyone who uses social media!
Fake Famous,69,64,audience,Superb! Wonderful film. So eye-opening and entertaining. 5 stars!!
Fake Famous,69,64,audience,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!! Such an informative and disturbing behind the scenes look into the world of influencers. This should become required viewing for young impressionable adults
Fake Famous,69,64,audience,"Eye-opening and well-done. I have written off ""influencers"" as mindless idiots, but didn't realize that Influencer is the #1 highest rated ""career"" among Americans age 18-25. And I didn't realize quite how completely fake and almost entirely house-of-cards illusion and basically infomercial after infomercial these ""influencers'"" content is. Nor knew very much about the mechanics of buying followers (the whole notion of follower is repugnant to me) or buying bots. Worthwhile."
Fake Famous,69,64,audience,Interesting but not surprising.
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
There's a lot more to the illusion, and the documentary is particularly fascinating when it shows the tricks influencers use - such as paying to take selfies in a fake private-jet interior that's booked out days in advance.
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
As a social experiment, Fake Famous is a mixed bag. As a documentary, it's a success. Anyone interested in this world and the way it works will find this film plenty engaging. Bilton and company are doing it for the 'Gram.
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
A new documentary argues the obvious: that influencer culture is soulless. What's harder, and what would have made for a more worthwhile film, is to explain why such vapidity appeals to young people
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
Following the story of the dare is a gravely funny and bittersweet experience. Revealing, too.
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
It's largely the most insightful look at influencers and an excellent primer on who they are and why they exist at all. The answer isn't quite as simple as you think, and that's exactly why this is a must-watch.
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
While their tales don't unfold entirely as planned, the HBO documentary exposes how ripe for manipulation this whole culture is, and the powerful incentives to game the system.
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
Fake Famous wants you to think it's telling you the real, authentic truth. But by the end of the documentary, the finger-wagging is so earnestly smug that you feel like rushing to look at Instagram makeup tips for a bracing dash of honesty.
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
Tries to keep the topic of fake fame lighthearted instead of depressing, but it still points out how being an ""influencer"", while having lots of perks, isn't the same as being famous, and never will be.
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
I was engaged, but completely unconvinced by Fake Famous. But I also have only 200 Instagram followers, so what do I know?
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
Bilton goes to great and sometimes purposefully self-deprecating lengths to be up-front about the artifice of his project.
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
I didn't personally find that much new or profound here. I wish that it had gone a little bit deeper and more nuanced.
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
I found a lot of it quite eye-opening.
 "
Fake Famous,69,64,critic,"
The film succeeds in part due to Bilton's willingness to follow his three subjects no matter their decisions. Unlike reality television producers, he does not seem interested in molding the influencers to fit his image.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,audience,"Pretty, noir, nineties-ish, but also a bit nothing.  Watching this does feel a lot like Se7en.  But Seven is dense and moist, seven is strong and flavourful.  In comparison, this is like cordial that's been watered down too far."
The Little Things,46,66,audience,Good movie. Aging Denzel suited the role. He was just as good as always.
The Little Things,46,66,audience,"The little things that actually make a movie to be good aren't anywhere to be found. 

It just doesn't work. The whole cast is completely unutilized (an early sign of the clumsy, bland script). I don't know if it was only my perception, but the characters are so badly written and developed that I felt everyone was trying too hard to remember their lines.  Everything feels so staged and mechanic, that even when you're sensing some shady, intense vibes, or that something terrible is about to happen, you just never get there. The bomb never explodes in this two-hour-long rehash of a story we've already seen before. Washington and Malick are not even close to being credible nor likable. They never even seemed determined enough to catch the killer, at least not until the third act. Leto's five-minute on-screen time delivers some creepy moments, but still, he wasn't convincing enough... not impressed but not quite sure of his Golden Globe nom. 

The storyline is all over the place, with some scenes that don't add anything interesting to the story, and these spontaneous jumps back in time and radical cuts between scenes make it a confusing, slow, and dull experience overall. The score was effective, very Newman. 

The only resemblance between Se7en and this is the black cop-white cop combo and nothing else."
The Little Things,46,66,audience,It was okay.l just  wished it had a better ending & not leave me with questions lol .Would I watch it again not.I think it could of had a better story line .
The Little Things,46,66,audience,I like Denzel Washington and cop movies.
The Little Things,46,66,audience,Ending was not expected.
The Little Things,46,66,audience,"little on the long side especially after a long brunch. suspenseful, great acting, Denzel was superb, great casting.  overall a very enjoyable movie. 

makes a underlying statement about law enforcement that is very pertinent to our society"
The Little Things,46,66,audience,Slow pace to movie. Story decent.
The Little Things,46,66,audience,Would be better if the ending was a little better
The Little Things,46,66,audience,"Good movie
Denzel is always a great actor"
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
Just an overdose of acting pills, and the rest is just boring.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
Ultimately, though some elements, including a thoughtful climax, are almost on their way to being interesting, there is simply nothing working to make this worth enduring.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
... pretends to be more than it is, and that pretense comes aggravated by the fact that its conclusion is stale and the process that leads to it remains hardly entertaining.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
It's about as fresh as a bloated, bile-tinged corpse dredged from the Los Angeles river, with a markedly similar colour palette to boot.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
What follows is a solidly crafted, no frills procedural, with writer/director John Lee Hancock getting plenty of mileage out of both Washington and Malik's maverick mentor/young gun dynamic...
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
It's hard to believe three Oscar winning actors could be involved with something so unsatisfying.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
The main disappointment, other than female characters who only exist to be disposed of, comes from recognising the kernel of something unusual buried in the film's marrow.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
It would work as popcorn entertainment were it not for the presence of Jared Leto, who delivers one of the worst performances of 2021 so far. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
...Washington adds another effective entry to his roster of tough guys...
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
An atmospheric thriller with few thrills, but fortunately there's a killer cast to save the whole thing from being a complete waste of time.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
Netflix can knock these kind of crime dramas off the conveyor belt with ease and with far less starpower attached, so how is it that three Oscar winners came to make something this uneventful? That's the real mystery here.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
Denzel Washington's deputy is the only arresting part in the problematic Little Things.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
Just when you've written it off, a few original ideas emerge in its final stretch.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
A bleak and slow burning serial killer story with its big names making up much of the work the narrative shortfalls necessitate.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
The strong performances of the cast aren't enough to save this disappointing, slow-paced and problematic thriller. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
It's not a bad film, but it's not the film we thought it would be.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
Here, ladies and gentlemen, we have that rarest of all things - a Denzel dud.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
...a slow, labored affair, with tonal shifts that seem telegraphed far ahead of their arrival or often prove to be much ado about nothing.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
...quirky performance by Rami Malek as a troubled fellow cop, and a scintillating, award-quality performance by main suspect Jerod Leto, even though it's 30 minutes too long.
 "
The Little Things,46,66,critic,"
(Malek is) all wrong for the character, his bouts of rage coming off more like childish hissy fits, but he's so over-the-top at the end that the film loses what little credibility it had left.
 "
Palmer,75,88,audience,"The premise, we've seen it before, but it's the chemistry between Justin Timberlake and Ryder Allen that boosts this film up. Ryder Allen has a long way ahead, and he's the one responsible for making this experience an absolute charmer, not to mention the incredible and necessary queer representation. It may be a bit too long, but I felt that despite its flaws, it works in a very good way."
Palmer,75,88,audience,"The movie good because it does show a variety of different aspects of life. However, if the movie was a food, it seemed liked a bland food."
Palmer,75,88,audience,"Doesn't feel particularly inspired, memorable nor free of the 'cultish wokesville' factor - but sweet, well-acted and thoughtful enough to balance things out. 3.75/5"
Palmer,75,88,audience,"This was the most heartwarming film I have seen in a while. It is about the unexpected relationship between Timberlake, a recently released felon, and the sweet but effeminate young boy next door. Loved every minute, just great."
Palmer,75,88,audience,"It was a magnificent movie and truly genuine story line.

The actors portrayals of characters in real life, heart rendering situations, swept me through emotional ups and downs.

I highly recommend this movie!"
Palmer,75,88,audience,Love seeing a different side of Justin Timberlake. Beautiful and cute story of the sweet little boy ! Must watch !!
Palmer,75,88,audience,"This is a great film, yes you know from the start where is going, yes you know is a typical redemption, but the cast is good, the little boy steals every scene and in the end it gives you that feeling of ""hold my tears"" you love in this kind of film"
Palmer,75,88,audience,"Everyone makes mistakes, we are humans after all. What is important is, some people deserves a  second chance, a hand, an ear,  or just comprehension. As humans we just to Sealand think what would it be if is us the person that is in that particular situation? A simple act of kindness, can help to rebuild somebody's life, can help to save a life. A must seen film!"
Palmer,75,88,audience,"Should have started the movie with the incident that put JT in jail, then fast forwarded to when he got out of prison. Sure it is cliché but showing the incident would have provided character development to show how much he had changed. JT was OK, Maggie was good, and the boy that played Sam was excellent. Movie was a bit long for 1:51."
Palmer,75,88,audience,Outstanding performance by Justin Timberlake.
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
It could be a bit corny for some, but it's a beautiful story at the end of the day. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
The storytelling is formulaic, deliberately familiar, and prosaic, sometimes frustratingly so.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
Whatever lessons may be learned during the course of Palmer, the film avoids feeling preachy or too heavy with messages.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
The acting and powerful storytelling belie expectations. See it, and you will be impressed. Timberlake underplays terrifically.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
As directed by Fisher Stevens and performed by a first-rate cast the film is low-keyed, sincere, humanistic and occasionally shockingly tough.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
Palmer is terrible, it's true, but in a bland way that makes it more innocuous than offensive.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
It's unlikely to bother the Oscars, but this really is the most heartwarming film of the past year and it's well worth 110 minutes of your time.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
Being the lead in a homegrown movie is where part-time actors stand out in a good or bad way, but Timberlake hits all the high notes here.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
You realize you've become invested - quite invested - less so with Timberlake's titular character, Eddie Palmer, than with the unusual young boy for whom he is caring: Ryder Allen's Sam.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
Palmer reestablishes Justin Timberlake as a magnetic leading man
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
Sometimes good intentions and proper execution fail to work concurrently in movies, as is the case with the well-meaning but bland ""Palmer.""
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
""Implausibly written.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
For all its wholesomeness and good intentions, Palmer just doesn't have enough to warrant major investment.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
The setup may sound clichéd, but the execution and solid performances make it anything but.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
Much more affected than I expected...I'd like to see more films starring her. Very well-written.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
Instead of striking an authentic chord, Palmer mostly settles for Hollywood posturing.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
Justin Timberlake and Ryder Allen are a joy to watch together in Palmer.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
Justin Timberlake is a welcome presence on screen and not a bad actor, but he doesn't have the chops to completely pull this off as we think a Tom Hardy or Christian Bale might. This role calls for more emotional depth.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
It's familiar material, but Fisher Stevens' fine drama proceeds with care and compassion, using excellent performances to help create a moving, thoughtful, and inclusive experience.
 "
Palmer,75,88,critic,"
With a hugely moving tale of redemption & acceptance, along with fantastic performances from Ryder Allen & Justin Timberlake, this is another strong original Apple TV+ entry.
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,audience,"Just watch it. NOTE: One of the “I am a” cards from the show included Hater, I hope. Because that’s a real identity and I see several in the audience reviews. "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,audience,"What a show.  So Derek DelGaudio is a storyteller and a conceptual magician.  He had a one-man show that ran off-Broadway for 552 performances.  This is the filmed version of his live performance.  Now I went into this one reasonably cold.  A person I trust put out a blanket recommendation on Twitter, so I added it to my watchlist.  I had 90 minutes to spare, but all I knew about it was the 280 characters of praise that I read in a tweet.  Knowing as little as possible going in is the way to approach this, and if you are a fan of theatre and just storytelling in general, you should get ready for a real treat.  This show was nothing short of a journey, and while I went into this hoping for the best, I never expected to get so much to chew on in an hour and a half.  I was not familiar with Derek DelGaudio in any capacity, so I was immediately sucked in with how engrossing of a storyteller he is.  I didn't know what I was getting into; it was spooky at one point and then humorous at the next, and it has a little bit of every emotion on the spectrum.  Because of that, I never knew where it was going, so I remained wholly invested, even more than I get when I watch some random movie.  It was to the point where I didn't want to get up and use the bathroom, and everything about this performance is put together with skill, craft, and care.  I was, however, torn on if I should actually review this and count this as a movie.  I had the same deliberation when Hamilton came out last year.  I watched it as soon as it was available on streaming, but I never reviewed it because I don't consider it to be a movie.  Hamilton is excellent and very worthy of your time, but I made a decision early on in the creation of this blog that I'm only here to review films.  Both of these pieces are the filmed version of a live performance, but here, there is more editing and filmmaking that went into it.  There are elements (like animation, for example) in this that you wouldn't get even if you were lucky enough to see the live stage production, and because that is the case, I am considering this as a movie instead.  Plus, this could use the promotion, whereas Hamilton already comes with a pre-established fan base.  If you are as starved for live theatre as I am, then this production is a godsend.  I just watched this two days ago, and I cannot stop thinking about it.  It's the type of performance that you want to share with any and everybody, and I don't remember the last time that I could say that I loved the philosophy behind the art, regardless of the medium.  It will likely make you want to meditate on the existential, and I think it could honestly change your outlook on life.  I can't wait to watch this again."
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,audience,Absolute must watch. I loved every moment of it. Incredible.
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,audience,"Totally unique. Mind boggling, personal, emotional, masterful, magical."
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,audience,"I can't even tell you what I watched. It was moving, powerful, emotional & sometimes funny but I know I missed a lot and should probably watch it again. Some of the things Derek does is pure magic and not in the ""magician"" sense. He's got a talent of memory recall that's pretty incredible-almost to the point of a photographic memory. At the beginning, the viewer is asked to turn off their phone and remove themselves from any distractions. I didn't, thinking it was a stupid request-it's not. You feel (at least I did) as though you're missing out not being in the live audience since the entire show is so interactive but you definitely get the gist of it all. Please watch it-and if you're like me, you'll have to watch it again."
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,audience,A bit highfalutin' but worth a watch
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,audience,For the weak minded and easily influenced.
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,audience,Not worth the watch.
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,audience,"This show will blow your mind! Conceptual artist/magician Derek DelGaudio performed this show 522 times in New York and this is a recorded documentation. While musing on identity, he performs card tricks, simple illusions and mental magic…much of it is astounding. He also involves the audience throughout to equally incredible results. His solemn pace and quiet delivery create a deliberate, philosophical approach, but this thoughtful magic show will leave you moved and amazed.
NOTE: Director Frank Oz captured the show on several nights, so you get to see various reactions and a number of famous attendees"
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,audience,"Every so often, a film comes along that is so innovative and thought provoking, one wants to tell everyone. This is one of those."

The piece envelopes us, mesmerizes us, brings tears to our eyes. Do yourself a favor-see it and believe.

A once-in-a-lifetime movie of a once-in-a-lifetime performance pleading for inter/intra-personal compassion and empathy.
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
A beautiful, powerful performance that employs art, illusion, storytelling, and its own audience to explore aspects of identity, isolation, and our own desperate drive to figure out who we are as individuals.
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
DelGaudio certainly can be mesmerizing, and the movie version of In and Of Itself keenly captures his ability to draw us in.

An elegantly constructed, one-man, philosophical magic show.

Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
One of the most astonishing things I've seen in a long time ...
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
In & Of Itself is a great balm for those of us missing live theatre, but it's also a stunning piece of cinema on its own. It's the kind of art that sticks with you afterwards.
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
The film is a transcendent experience that largely lets the one-man show speak for itself without veering into the detachment of a concert film that simply documents the night of.
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
In & Of Itself might be brave act of kindness, it might be cynical show of trickery, it might be both at once or something else altogether. Whatever else it is, it's completely fascinating.
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
[A] masterful piece of work, one that takes full advantage of its unconventional structure and the idiosyncratic skill set of its creator. Smart and sad, it's a highwire balance of passion and pathos that simply refuses to do what you expect it to do.
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
A meditation on personal identity isn't what we expect from a magic show, but DelGaudio makes it work.

The virtuoso applies an extraordinary personal touch to his highly focused hocus-pocus.
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
Home movies and animation are employed to varying effect but keep In & Of Itself from feeling stagebound as DelGaudio builds toward the film's emotional (really) finale.
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
The place of magic in In & Of Itself is not to amaze for amazement's sake, although I was certainly stunned by some of what happened. It's that the unreal is used to create the super-real.
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
It feels like a goddamn miracle
 "
Derek DelGaudio's In & of Itself,100,92,critic,"
Granted, watching something like In & Of Itself in your living room isn't quite the same experience as seeing the show in an intimate theatrical setting. But for now, it's the next-best thing, and as structured, a very good one at that.

Clapboard Jungle: Surviving the Independent Film Business,94,,critic,"
There's no denying that Clapboard Jungle should be watched by every kid with a camera dreaming of becoming a director, but I wish McConnell had partnered with a documentarian to shape his footage into something a little more focused.

Fascinating documentary about and demonstrating the journey from film idea to production, from the point of view of such an independent filmmaker, and including advice and insight from countless others.

The White Tiger,92,80,audience,"I liked the movie's style, but before I watched the movie, I saw the trailer and felt like it gave away most of the movie."
The White Tiger,92,80,audience,"The movie is based on the book of same name which I read and wondered can this type of story be adapted into a movie. 

I felt the white tiger as a movie was little bit better than the book as we can understand the situation more in the movie. Every cast member, especially the main lead played their part nicely and story was properly told.

Overall, this movie properly adapted the novel. It's a good watch and would recommend this movie to drama and satire lovers."
The White Tiger,92,80,audience,"A brilliant distillation of the novel into this well-written drama. Dark and grim in parts, this is a great story about a driver's rise from poverty, using his wit and cunning, whilst at the same time being twisted and reshaped by his deeds along the way"
The White Tiger,92,80,audience,"I did like this. The acting and the production quality were well enough. I did have conflicting feelings the entire time about the story, though-- morally, that is. I don't expect art to be morally unambiguous. I'm glad this didn't make a clear separation between good and evil. Most of the characters here had both good and evil in their portrayal. So I would say that is a good thing conceptually, but it still lacked on the entertainment side. I was engaged, but only just enough."
The White Tiger,92,80,audience,"Hubby and Wife date afternoon brings us 'The White Tiger', a movie that is never boring, but never really interesting with a blah finish.  The take it or leave it structure with the flashbacks and the flash forwards was a leave it for hubby and a shrug from wife.  There are things that really bugged both of us in this Ramin Bahrani picture.  Dialogue, ugh!  Adarsh Gourav is transformative in a starring role.  Wife: 6.7/Hubby: 5 Average: 5.9/10"
The White Tiger,92,80,audience,"Adarsh Gourav's Ramin Belram is such an unexpected protagonist to American audiences that it's almost surprising when The White Tiger ends when it does. Wait, the conclusion comes when our man is on top and not after the fallout of his sure-to-be-doomed master plan? It's both unexpected yet completely gratifying. To this extent, Ramin Bahrani's film (whose work I've seen thus far I've quite enjoyed) doesn't settle on simply being a story of good and evil, heroes and villains, but a film that explores how difficult it is to tell the difference these days. Based on Aravind Adiga's award-winning 2008 novel, The White Tiger sports the attitude of a satire and the tone of a crime drama as it explores the ever-expanding divide between the rich and the poor in India. That said, as much time as we spend with Belram and as much time as the film dedicates to steeping the viewer in this culture it somehow still fails to feel as if we've really become a part of Ramin's journey. The plight of Ramin is certainly felt as is a sense of sympathy for him, but the arc of the narrative and lack of any real propulsion regarding Ramin's ambition never translates in the pacing resulting in that seemingly abrupt, albeit satisfying conclusion. It's simply a shame the aforementioned journey isn't as equally as satisfying."
The White Tiger,92,80,audience,Very good representation of life 
The White Tiger,92,80,audience,"Slick, funny, sad, and cynical all at once. To fit so much into one movie, surely the edit suffers a bit - this movie was just too long. However, its scale borders on epic so it's easy to forgive it for being a bit bloated. The White Tiger is a story of desperation, ambition, and morality that stayed with me for some time after watching. How far would you go to escape a predestined reality for something more?"
The White Tiger,92,80,audience,"Ramin Bahrani's ""The White Tiger"" is an ambitious, darkly comic and gritty satire that sheds light on the oft-ignored class struggles of modern India. With his eighth feature, writer/director Ramin Bahrani has crafted a scathing indictment of the caste system in modern India. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to satirize the experiences of lower-caste drivers in India, but he pulls it off successfully. Using dazzling cinematography, Bahrani draws viewers into the world of a poverty-stricken chauffeur that dreams of becoming rich. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's cultural setting. Bahrani effectively employs a diverse color palette to draw a fine distinction between the lives of poor and upper-class individuals in India. It is hard to not praise the phenomenal performances from the cast. Adarsh Gourav delivers a star-making performance as Balram Halwai. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the ambitions, desperation and machiavellian streak of an impoverished servant that conspires to deceive his rich employers. The supporting cast, which includes the Bollywood legend Rajkumar Rao, is also spectacular and worthy of recognition. Although ""The White Tiger"" is undeniably an unforgettable class satire, ultimately it is not a flawless film. It is unevenly paced, and struggles to maintain momentum following an engrossing first hour. Moreover, it builds to an exaggerated conclusion that sugarcoats the harsh realities of poverty. Nevertheless, fans of the beloved book will definitely enjoy ""The White Tiger"" and so will movie-goers seeking enlightening entertainment. At a time when Indian impoverishment remains glamorized in Hollywood, its a stark reminder of the harsh realities that lower-caste servants continue to experience in one of the world's most underdeveloped countries."
The White Tiger,92,80,audience,Definitely worth watching.  Fascinating movie with a lackluster ending.

A hundred castes and a thousand Gods boil down to two paths, the full belly and the empty one. How many have the courage to make the choice?
 "
The White Tiger,92,80,critic,"
The White Tiger is a sleek and exhilarating production, but what makes it work is Balram's grubby, conflicted humanity.

Any hope or salvation The White Tiger offers is laced with a drop of arsenic, and there are certainly no Bollywood dance numbers to lift your spirits.

When watching Balram's struggles, I felt bad for him but I couldn't empathize with him because of the dialogue. It was very clunky and made it hard to enjoy aspects of the film, especially the emotion.

Bahrani makes no compromises - while he goes to unsettling places, his narrative control makes us believe these characters' journeys.
 "
The White Tiger,92,80,critic,"
Due to his lower caste position, Balram has been conditioned since birth to obey, even when we can see it is tearing him up inside - and Gourav does an excellent job of showing how this pushes him to the brink of madness.

Directed by Iranian-American filmmaker Ramin Bahrani, the film is a breeze despite some tired cliches. It ends up as an insider's take on corruption and caste and class-divides in India...
 "
The White Tiger,92,80,critic,"
The White Tiger pokes its needles deep, revealing that in an unbalanced society, it's easier to take away options from the oppressed than it is to give them rights. The class struggle in the film is then, both personal and political.

Outside the Wire,37,58,audience,"This movie is sooooo shitty.  Terrible plot, terrible script, terrible everything."
Outside the Wire,37,58,audience,"I wish there was an option to give 0 stars because if there were, I would use it. Absolutely the worst movie I have ever wasted my time on. I would have rather watched a banana ripen. I have broken my back and this movie was more uncomfortable to sit through than the ambulance ride to the hospital. Soooooooooo disappointed!!!!!!!"
Outside the Wire,37,58,audience,"War movie with robots. Kid accepts collateral damage without blinking, disobeying orders though it got the job done. A robot picks this guy out to take the fall when the robot blows a nuclear bomb in the US."
Outside the Wire,37,58,audience,The plot was interesting but very hard to follow. And who doesn't love a movie about robot soldiers. But with that said - it was a terrible movie. I would not recommend it.
Outside the Wire,37,58,audience,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The main characters are complex, changing and relatable. The faceless but dumb machines that shoot in error ARE terrifying, making the plight of the cyborg (Leo) believable. Harp is an earnest, intelligent soldier turns hero and Leo is always a fascinating enigma. A cast of well known actors with great performances - at times I was forgetting I was watching an action flick. Loved the sets of Ukraine that were very chilling - showing how an unofficial war/peacekeeping ""mission"" tears a society. There were two things where my suspension of disbelief was challenged - that a drone pilot who never shoot anyone manages to disable a cyborg that effortlessly kills the most powerful rebels - although it's well supported by heartfelt dramatic moments and Leo's, for whatever reason, ""liking"" of Harp. The biggest thing though was that the US military would create such a superior killer cyborg but not think of making removal of the fail switch impossible or fatal for the cyborg? Really?"
Outside the Wire,37,58,audience,this movie has a good concept but the execution is just generic and boring I give it a C-
Outside the Wire,37,58,audience,"Neither bad or good. Tolerable. Forgettable. Plot was too vague to be engaging the whole show. But there was plenty of action. We're just blindly led along. Mackey was good. Idris couldn't carry his part. He doesn't have the intensity, script or acting chops to pull off the character."
Outside the Wire,37,58,audience,The trailer lures you in. The movie lulls you out.
Outside the Wire,37,58,audience,"This has the potential to great but falls short. Much of the dialogue is just amateur. Effects are good, plot has many holes."

A promising premise let down by a plot with no one to root for.

Robocop meets Terminator meets Training Day in Mikael Håfström's Outside the Wire. It works fine as your basic Action movie, but the runtime and the multiple plot twists on the third act turn it a bit tiresome.

A noisy time-waster that could have used some outside the box thinking to make its shop-worn story more effective.

Outside the Wire is a standard sci-fi mix with war, it has some cool action sequences, but not enhancing the genre outside what we already know.

As an actual professor of Eastern European politics, I literally have no idea what parts of the movie are honest ignorance versus ironic ignorance.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
With a straight to the point, simplistic save the world style, that can get too drowned out with mindless action, this tag team struggle through urban warfare may not be a very memorable experience. However, that doesn't mean it isn't a fun one.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
Despite some good work from the actors, and impressive visuals at times, even as a time-passer, Outside the Wire comes up short.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
Forgettable, by-numbers, and just not very good.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
The film has the narrative and creative range of a low-budget video game. It is exasperating and dull.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
Outside The Wire feels like a middling effort with an ineffective gimmick and undercooked script.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
Fast-paced and sharply well-designed, this futuristic war thriller is packed with gritty action and seamless effects.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
""Outside the Wire"" passes the time, and there are worse crimes than being watchable and disposable.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
Just an average sci-fi action movie with a lot less on its mind than it might have had.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
Outside the Wire repeatedly pushes the central irony of pairing an emotionally detached human with a compassionate killing machine without drawing any meaningful conclusions from their contrasting personalities.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
A by-the-numbers Stealth-meets-Training Day plod.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
Journeyman director Mikael Håfström at least mines some decent Robocop-meets-Jason-Bourne acrobatics out of Leo, but adds little besides.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
There's a rote quality to the presentation that grates as the movie builds to an ending that ends up pulling its punches.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
Extremely violent sci-fi tale tackles war consequences.
 "
Outside the Wire,37,58,critic,"
A disappointingly tidy conclusion for what had the potential to be a far more challenging film.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,audience,"Absolutely terrible. Each scene is way too long, the whole build up to this ‘heist' is incredibly slow, no excitement at all at any place of the movie, was bored through-out - skipped forwards and even still was rubbish. Had high hopes given the cast and trailer looking fairly good, wouldn't recommend to anyone. Let's sweep this one back under the rug!"
Locked Down,43,30,audience,Actually loved this movie..yes I'm still locked down..
Locked Down,43,30,audience,"As the next movie after Songbird (2020) to be released that's set in lockdown, this one's weirdly nostalgic rather than contemporary, feeling like a gentle cross between anything Royal Court Theatre circa 1994 and Stefan Schwartz's Shooting Fish (1997). If that sounds good to you, you'll love it."
Locked Down,43,30,audience,"Left me thoughtful but not in a good kind of way. The movie has its ass between two chairs and doesn't really know what it want to be. The heist part comes in very late and seems just like an artifact to throw some thrills that it clearly never owns at any moment in its dramatic construction. The relationship part could have been the most interesting part with an eye of life inside the virus blocage but falls short of stakes even if at least enough compelling thanks to the cast and a few good lines of dialogue.
In the end, very talkative with not much to take out of it. Locked down or let down, the balance is heading towards the second unfortunately."
Locked Down,43,30,audience,"All you'll hear in 80% of this film is random useless ""blah blah blahh"".

Firstly, shout out to the all-star stellar cast and performances - and for putting up with a script abundant in unnecessary and useless dialogue.

Producer and director Doug Liman's directing was excellent, although he should've addressed Knight's script issues prior to filming. The cinematography was decent, and although the score started off obnoxiously loud, it leveled off adequately.

However, executive producer and writer Steven Knight had a great premise to his story, but ruined it with 80% of his screenplay's schizoid dialogue having constant annoying random useless ""blah blah blahh"" from his two leads. I literally wanted to stick sharp pencils in my ears.

What's even worse, is that you had to sit through 118 cringe-worthy minutes listening to this useless garble, and with the slow pacing, it felt like a 3+ hour long film. Had even half of that random garble been substance instead of blabbering filler, it might've been bearable. Never mind the ridiculous plot and technical issues filled with contradictions and implausibilities.

For punishment, I suggest Knight write all the dialogue on a chalk board five times and see how he feels after that. It'll be only a tenth of the suffering the viewer had to sit thru. It's a generous 6/10 all going towards the cast for their pain and suffering."
Locked Down,43,30,audience,"Essentially a heist movie set in the beginning of the ""Age of COVID"". For some it might be a bit 'too soon' to be doing a movie centered around current events, but I'm alright with it. Both leads are incredible here(Anne Hathaway especially). Only gripe here is it suffers from a very predictable and convenient ending."
Locked Down,43,30,audience,"Locked Down sees the flow of lockdown-made movies begin. The pacing is uneven but the premise is enjoyable, with Hathaway and Ejiofor shining. A movie for the moment, so give it a watch, as there is nothing better to do."
Locked Down,43,30,audience,Couldn't get past the first ten minutes. I blame the director more than anyone else. Probably the most horrendous beginning of a movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot over more than sixty years of watching movies.
Locked Down,43,30,audience,"Eh... it wasn't a total waste of time. There were some good spots in the film. I can't quite pinpoint when the film lost me, but it most definitely did at some point. The scenes with Ben Kingsley were the best! Absolutely hilarious! The heist itself was rather weak."
Locked Down,43,30,audience,It was just wonderful. Ignore the critics.
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
Kinda fun with good chemistry, but utterly disposable...
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
Zoom cameos from a few stars and a heist storyline add a bit of zest, but you still may want to free yourself long before the end credits.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
It feels like a missed opportunity.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
It's far too dry and meandering for an entertaining bit of fluff, but delirious enough to capture the mood of the moment.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
The entire film, in short, is an abominable mistake.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
The film deserves total lockdown, preferably in a steel vault, somewhere deep underground.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
Just like lockdown itself this is mostly tedious, and feels never-ending.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
Though the film is far from good, Hathaway's cabin-fever-induced irrationality is weirdly involving.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
The movie is both entertaining and slightly dull at the same time.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
It doesn't hold together in tone or plot, but as with its screwball predecessors, wacky antics are a ruse to explore what makes a relationship work.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
For a jape-like film with a criminal scheme in its back pocket, there are Waiting for Godot levels of not-much-happening.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
The film's constant references to every day lockdown activities such as bread-making, day-drinking and endless Zoom meetings often come off as stale and cringeworthy rather than inspired.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
Must have seemed like quite the wheeze when greenlit, but now has all the appetising novelty of your eighth Zoom of the day.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
The pandemic-induced hysteria is infused with an entertaining irreverence, which keeps things amusing and escapist...
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
Feels like a very long zoom call with someone you don't know well. It's awkward, it's uncomfortable, and you're counting down the minutes until it ends.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
It chips away, in small ways, at the idea of being locked down and unable to express freedom...it's about spending time with these actors, which makes it worthwhile...
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
With better writing, that pivot would be a fun twist, but Locked Down fails to pull it off. That said, the last 30 minutes of the movie are imminently more fun than what came before it.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
Locked Down takes us back to a pretty rotten time - a time we've not yet truly been able to put in the rearview - but it has a pretty good time doing it.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
Squeezes in a lot of COVID-era issues, from company layoffs, to pot-banging tributes and homemade sourdough bread. The film is amusing partly because it hits on these resonant COVID-tropes. That and some nice stunt casting, makes this rom-com/heist fun.
 "
Locked Down,43,30,critic,"
Despite Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor having a good time, the plot unravels too much at the end to the point of ridiculousness.

Soul,95,88,audience,"Vibrant and beautiful to look at, as well as to consider. Masterful in its approachable blend of humor and existentialism."
Soul,95,88,audience,The best Pixar movie in the Decade of 2010-2020
Soul,95,88,audience,"Soul is a real charmer. An eye-opener not just for the little ones, but for every single person out there. There are no standard characters here. There are souls, real, relatable emotions. We don't have to talk about the animation, because we already know Pixar never fails to delight us with it. A film that will make you go out there and pursue your dreams in a very philosophical and entertaining way. It's no surprise Pete Docter directed Inside Out, which works and feels like its spiritual cousin. The music is inspiring (although I would've liked more jazz in it).

Can't wait for a re-watch. A near-perfect way to end this crazy year. Shine on!"
Soul,95,88,audience,Otra obra maestra de Pixar apenas la vi me hizo salir a la calle a contemplar cada minuto.......petee docter eres un genio😍😍
Soul,95,88,audience,"Soul is not perfect, and there are better Pixar films such as Up (2009), Wall-E (2008) and Toy Story 3 (2010), that offer more of an emotional punch than this did. Still, I think this movie has the best philosophical ideas and is a worthy entry into the Pixar canon, they really did something different this time. Well worth checking out for all ages.

 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
A smart, tender and contemplative piece of stunning filmmaking all on its own terms.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
This may be Pixar's most 'adult' film, in terms of its themes, its mostly middle-aged characters, its sometimes experimental and -- yes -- jazzy animation (heaven is run by characters who are nothing but squiggly lines), and its soundtrack.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
With its fragmented narrative, it feels almost like a shorts collection jazz riff on the theme of existence and metaphysics, plus quite a few of the jokes feel extremely American-specific and won't translate well for international audiences.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
Pixar does some serious soul-searching embarking on an existential adventure that'll go to infinity and the great beyond!
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
Even with some wrong notes, Soul has enough going for it to give it a reasonably toe-tapping recommendation. Just don't expect it to come together like a great piece of jazz.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
Soul's overall message in conjunction with the surrealness of the afterlife and vibrant New York atmosphere leaves you with things to contemplate and appreciate.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
What follows is an absolute delight. It will make any viewer cherish the life they have and want to live it more fully, every single day, ideally with lots of laughs along the way.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
'Soul' has magic, music and meaning.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
Soul has a perfectly good message. Still, once director Pete Docter and co-director Kemp Powers, who both wrote the script with Mike Jones, lead us through how things work, they fall back on convention.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
Soul is beautifully structured and animated. Pixar remains undefeated at putting me through the emotional wringer.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
It is the story, and the message within it, above anything else, that is Soul's best achievement.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
It shortchanges itself at every turn by overextending itself.
 "
Soul,95,88,critic,"
Preaching to a mismatched choir that deserves a sermon that's more thoughtful and allows for greater individual interpretation than what is offered. But the animation is terrific!

...it would be hard to argue against Soul being one of 2020's most comforting, pleasurable films...
 "

Soul feels timeless in the way most Pixar films do, rooted in a stylistic place but boasting themes and ideas, and magical worlds, that stretch beyond the now.

Greenland,78,64,audience,"Going in I wasn't expecting much, but this may well be the best rock crashing into Earth movie I've seen. This writer and director know it's not about jingoism or heroics or over the top nonsense.  It's about fear. Trying to make sure your family and loved ones are safe. It's a good well made B movie. Kudos."
Greenland,78,64,audience,"I really wanted to like this movie. The actors were all wonderful. The effects were great. The concept, though frequently visited, was a good foundation for a film. But sadly, the end result was a concentrated doo-doo bomb. My goodness…how long will these people keep traveling back and forth on the same highway? Three quarters of this film is the dad trying to find the wife and kid, the wife trying to find the kid and every stupid situation that can revolve around that tired old ""family means everything"" trope. Meanwhile the ""disaster"" part of this film is almost entirely presented as ""news reports"" with the preamble, ""What you about to see may shock you."" No. What would have shocked me is if this film had managed to not become yet another predictable wanna-be blockbuster that died on the launch pad. Save your rental money and wait till it's on Amazon Prime before you waste your time on this dud."
Greenland,78,64,audience,"It is exactly what you're expecting to see. Another ""end of the world"" film, that may feel a bit too overlong, but entertaining and emotional enough to keep on watching till the end."
Greenland,78,64,audience,Great topic and lead actor which should have led to a better movie. Nice end of days plot but with considerable lengths.
Greenland,78,64,audience,"Best film we've watched in ages, action packed, gripping and great chemistry between the family"
Greenland,78,64,audience,"As a big fan of disaster films, I was surprised how deeply Greenland affected me. It is not your typical Roland Emmerich schlok-fest like 2012 or Independence Day, although I enjoyed them for the fun popcorn movies they were meant to be. Greenland is a new breed of disaster film. It is a very serious look at what might actually happen when a nearly extinction-level cometary strike threatens our planet. This is very well written, and the acting performances are solid all the way through. For the first time I actually cared about what happened to the characters in a disaster film, and that is something I never thought I'd say. The suspense level was off the chart, and continued to build relentlessly all the way through. The effects work is absolutely top-notch, and very believable. This is the first thinking person's disaster film I've seen, and if you have even the slightest interest in the subject matter, be sure not to miss it. I think the most frightening thing about it is that this is something that really will happen someday. In many ways, Greenland plays more like a future documentary than a fictional entertainment. This is a stellar achievement!"
Greenland,78,64,audience,"This entire movie is just a mid-budget straight-to-streaming rehash of 2012. Gerard Butler's acting does all the heavy lifting, but other performances are pretty lackluster in comparison. Gaping plot holes and near-constant shameless cost-cutting. It's not the worst, but super cliché. Basically, it passes the time, but dont have a movie night centered around this one."
Greenland,78,64,audience,"This low-key mid-budget disaster movie trades noise and CGI for real characters and immersion. It is not revolutionary and it does get out of breath in the second part, but it's definitely better than anyone could have expected given its credentials."
Greenland,78,64,audience,"Story as old as time, disaster hits the US. Morena Baccarin's performance and her character's connection to her father makes up for it."
Greenland,78,64,audience,"Okay, I'm half way through and am already annoyed by the hysteria. First off, why couldn't they tell the women they can't take her daughter since she'd get rejected at the gate? Why do they stop every 5 seconds to explain their little brat what's going on? Shut up and move little turd. Thirdly, why the hack were they yelling ""we were selected"" like sheep when all they had to do is show the barcode? Annoying movie through and through."
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
At first, I thought someone had played a practical joke on me.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
The scenes of rioting resemble the news footage that accompanied the reign of President Trump. It was probably unintentional, but the similarities are startling, with the film evoking Americans at war with each other, a theme that is uncomfortably timely.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
Sure, there are plenty of explosions and breathtakingly horrifying sequences involving cities being annihilated by fragments of the comet, but the panic-fueled tension at the center of Greenland comes from the real human stakes driving its narrative.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
Doesn't often surprise, but it never disappoints.
 "

If you can ignore the at-times-laughable script this is a skilled, very dark and surprisingly effect disaster movie. (Blu-ray Review).

It's a silly script, but it's most definitely not stupid. Respect.

Greenland,78,64,critic,"
A bona fide disaster flick in the spirit of the modern disaster flick that was re-pioneered by Roland Emmerich.

The emphasis on people rather than the event makes this one of the best efforts in this very popular genre.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
Proves to be a compelling end-of-the-world spectacle that is as intense as it is heart-wrenching.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
Butler's a believably imperfect dad and husband who navigates the entertainingly improbably events of the movie with tongue firmly in cheek
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
Ric Roman Waugh's Greenland emerges as 2021's first major surprise: yet another large-scale disaster movie, it leaps head-and-shoulders above its genre to become the strongest film of its type since Michael Bay's Armageddon back in 1998.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
What comes out the other end is a paint-by-numbers disaster film with strong enough performances and action to do the job it set out to, but nothing more and nothing less.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
The film's strength lies in its intimate approach - we stay close to the family as they travel through a disintegrating landscape of givers and takers - and it is the human focus, rather than the special effects, that ultimately keeps you gripped.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
A typical disaster movie that manages to stand out by writing a more grounded story. Less about the spectacle and more about characters.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
Thrills - not worthwhile characters - are the priority.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
How tense it was, how gripping it was...what makes this work is proper tension, pacing and characters. This has all of that in spades.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
It gives you the same feel as those classic popcorn movies, but it's Butler and Baccarin's performances that give it so much heart, taking the film to a refreshing new level.
 "
Greenland,78,64,critic,"
GREENLAND is a throwback that goes through the motions to become a fun film to watch if you want to see the world burn.

A wedding comedy that proves as unpleasant as a real ceremony that goes hopelessly wrong.

Writer-director Amy Miller Gross never plays it for laughs, opting instead to explore darker feelings. And while she also indulges in some badly contrived twists and turns in the plot, the film has some nice things to say.

Sister of the Groom is not a film I could honestly recommend. There is no excitement, humor or focus.

Sister of the Groom has its charms, even when its characters are behaving unpleasantly...It's lightweight and occasionally uneven, but in the end, it's a wedding you won't regret having attended.

Are lead actor and executive producer Alicia Silverstone and writer-director Amy Miller Gross the Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot of rom-coms?

As much as I like Alicia Silverstone she could not save this confused and contrived comedy.

Sister of the Groom is torn between serving as a gimmicky comedy and an incisive character study, and those two elements never quite come together.
 "
Sister of the Groom,47,35,critic,"
Writer-director Amy Miller Gross ping pongs between wacky moments that should be affecting and vice versa to arrive at an awkward crossroads between Rachel Getting Married and a Jewish-themed My Big Fat Greek Wedding.

Write this one off as a ""nice try,"" and too bad about the laryngitis Ms. Silverstone.

 "

Plenty of interviews with former NBA commissioner David Stern, other NBA executives, agents, basketball reporters, some friends, and even teammates.
 "
Gap Year,,,critic,"
Gap Year is an interesting document, a filmed record of a unique path to the NBA...well paced and spaced, though I might have liked to see a little bit more - the story is engaging enough that I think it could have carried another 20 minutes.

A little more insight from Bazley would have made for a stronger documentary. The interviews in the film are very interesting. Has its moments, but too short.

The Stand In,31,17,audience,Double Drew should have been funnier
The Stand In,31,17,audience,"A dark and very funny satire of hollywood and the media that is out for blood at every turn, and will do anything to take down celebrities.  I found it to be very good- strong performances all around. A must see if you like dark satire!!!

T.J."
The Stand In,31,17,audience,"It was okay, not bad but not great also. Not as funny as I hoped it would be, it was more a showcase of Drew Barrymore's Charisma and Acting Skills, sometimes it seems that there really were two different people onscreen. 

That was the only thing that made it sort of bearable, though. Give it a pass if something better is available."
The Stand In,31,17,audience,"Ok, so.... um what did I just watch. Drew I love you the concept was great, meaning the grass is not always greener on the other side and that celebrities sometimes get tired of the BS....but the movie was rotten to the core! LML"
The Stand In,31,17,audience,The reason why u want to finish the movie is your a fan of Drew. Otherwise the movie is a waste of time.
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
Despite some funny bits, The Stand In is more of a drama about those who make comedies, somewhat like Judd Apatow's Funny People. If you go into it knowing this, it'll take you far less time to plug into it.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
This satire misfires.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
More sophisticated than it looks, this comedy takes the tropes of the raucous gross-out movie and twists them into an engaging and refreshingly offbeat rom-com.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
A missed opportunity...a hapless mixture of drama and farce that wastes some good performances, including two by Drew Barrymore.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
Unlikable Barrymore comedy has drug use, lots of swearing.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
[The] lack of consistency leaves you wondering just what the aim was. Of course, if the goal was a movie that can't figure out if it's Bowfinger or Single White Female, well ... mission accomplished?
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
By the time the credits roll, The Stand In only really asserts itself as something which would have benefitted from being trimmed down into a situational parody for an episodic television show.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
It's worth watching for fans, former fans, and non-fans of Drew Barrymore.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
In a role seemingly written for Melissa McCarthy, Drew Barrymore makes this film a fun two hours and reminds us of how much we enjoy her on screen.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
With sitcom-level depth and labored jokes, this comedy squanders a charismatic dual performance by Drew Barrymore and a premise ripe for self-aware satire.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
The Stand In is an enjoyable comedy about modern movie celebrity.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
As movies go, The Stand In certainly isn't a headliner. Yet like its title character, the movie and its star get about as much mileage as they can out of this opportunity.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
The film's meanders somewhere between comedy-ish and drama-ish, never managing either.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
Drew Barrymore's sweet charm always shines through the screen; it tends to lift indifferent material.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
While Barrymore throws herself into her dual roles with enthusiastic aplomb, this is a sluggish, brazenly unlikeable comedy-drama hybrid that's one of the year's more disappointing failures.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
Either skip it or have your own doppelganger watch instead of wasting your time.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
Drew is appealing, but the jokes in this showbiz farce miss more often than they hit.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
A ""Prince and the Pauper"" tale with an acerbic edge, it would be easy to dismiss ""The Stand In"" as a run-of-the-mill dark comedy if it were not for the involvement of Drew Barrymore.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
""The Stand-In"" is great fun, albeit dark, with unexpected drama that hooks you from the very beginning.
 "
The Stand In,31,17,critic,"
The Stand In makes many mistakes ... but its worst sin, arguably, is to make Drew Barrymore play two very unlikeable characters.

Mank,83,61,audience,Mank starts out promising but quickly dissolves into a hopeless mess.  From the moment the action moves to Hearst Castle the movie is close to unwatchable.  Amanda Seyfried is a good comic actor but horribly miscast here. She can't decide on her accent which is all over the place.  I blame it on a bad script and poor direction.  The idea that this movie could gain the most Oscar nominations is insane to me. Those Academy members are suckers for movies lionizing Hollywood so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  Blech!
Mank,83,61,audience,"It's far from Fincher's best work, yet Mank excels thanks to Oldman and Seyfried's performances and gorgeous cinematography."
Mank,83,61,audience,"I can't believe MANK was nominated for Oscars Best Picture. I could barely finish this black and white, self-indulgent, disingenuous, excruciatingly boring piece of crap. White Hollywood politics is in full blast with this farce of a nomination. (by the way, I had to double check that I didn't accidentally lower the brightness and sharpness levels on my new SmartTv. The entire movie was exceedingly dark, think Game of Thrones evening war scenes towards the end)."
Mank,83,61,audience,"Oh, this was a boring movie by any measure that could not be saved by some great acting. Considering the Oscar nods, I can only guess the Hollywood gang just loves movies about its own industry. What a disservice to Citizen Kane."
Mank,83,61,audience,Better than Citizen Kane u.u
Mank,83,61,audience,"A nice, intimate love letter to the old times. Sometimes struggles to entertain after the novelty of the aesthetic wears off. Good performances, though."
Mank,83,61,audience,"Mank serves as a glorious love letter to the golden age of movies. It may be Fincher's most speculative and meticulous film yet, that will definitely become a piece of work at the top of his craft. An in-depth vision of Hollywood and politics, that doesn't stay far from where we are now (it's incredible how back then people were trying to make people go to the movies, the same as today with the whole pandemic. Ironic how history repeats itself).

Gary Oldman never disappoints, and this time he gave us a witty, stubborn, and imprudent Herman J Mankiewicz, the mastermind behind Citizen Kane, and an unforgettable and ""vintage"" performance by Amanda Seyfried, that could've had worked perfectly in classic Hollywood too."
Mank,83,61,audience,"People in the film business just love films about the business and endow them with more importance than the rest of us. It's stylish, the character acting superb, the script laced with wit but it doesn't really work. Do we care? Is this about Wells sharing the credit? Does Fincher think he's actually made his own Citizen Kane by doing a backstory to Citizen Kane? Well, if he did, he hasn't. There's no Rosebud, no big reveal, no inner truth. The growth of Nazism is gently touched on, the film gets made, the Oscar won, Hurst isn't so bad, Marion's lot isn't awful. If the point is that Manc tells his truth, burns all his bridges and doesn't work again.. y'think? It's a nice couple of hours and easy on the eye, it just doesn't amount to a hill of beans."
Mank,83,61,audience,"David Fincher's recreation of ruthless 1930s Hollywood in ""Mank"" is a fascinating, but overstuffed look at Herman Mankiewicz's (Gary Oldman) dreadful life and how he came to co-write the screenplay of Orson Welles' 1941 groundbreaking ""Citizen Kane."""
Mank,83,61,audience,11.03.2021 ---------
Mank,83,61,critic,"
As an example of the screenwriting art, this film itself is pretty great.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
There's a lot of rancor that makes Mank work.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
If you're interested in the time period being depicted with a cynical undercurrent then make it Mank tonight.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
...a real treat for cinema connoisseurs, and something of a genuine triumph for Jack and David Fincher...
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
It even *looks* like 'Citizen Kane.'
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
Fincher made a number of risky choices along the way, the type that only a few mainstream filmmakers can get away with, and it all works quite beautifully. Surprisingly, Mank is, dare I say, a lot of fun to watch in large sections.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
But raising an issue is not the same thing as treating it properly and objectively. Here Mank falls down badly.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
Mank is a feast for cinephiles who appreciate the art that came from the Golden Age of Hollywood. But Mank is a famine for people who want to see movie characters with relatable emotions that are not motivated by greed or ruthless ambition.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
Mank could be perceived as a big left turn for Fincher, who has gained a reputation for dark and disturbing storytelling. But it fits right in, with a flawed protagonist whose egotism and/or lack of social graces makes him somewhat of a pariah.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
It's slow, funny, thoughtful, and asks all its questions in delicately indirect ways.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
For those of us who love Citizen Kane as much as Fincher, Mank is a godsend. But the reality is there's little here for the casual passer-by.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
Mank, the man and the film, leaves not just the impression of a man, but a country, and one that does not look much different almost a century on.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
It succeeds as a look at power and its corrosive effects but as a character study its colorful but feels slightly under inflated.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
Herman Mankiewicz wrote the screenplay for one of cinema's greatest pictures and Mank captures how the pursuit of greatness can swallow a man whole.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
Too much screen time is given to forced (and fictional) parallels between Mank's life and what ended up in Citizen Kane.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
It's his most modest yet ambitious work in years-not so much an ode to classic moviemakers as it is a lye burn on its black-and-white majesty, and a political screed to boot.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
Fincher's film is not geared towards flattery. Mank is much more interested in the pernicious greed of those who will dispense fallacies as fact if it means another dollar in their pocket.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
The powerful can do what they may, but if Mank proves anything, it's that the pages of history will have the last word - and it's usually the writer who's in control of those.
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
I can't recommend Mank for story at all, but you don't go into this for that. Not everybody can watch this, but I enjoyed it...
 "
Mank,83,61,critic,"
As a whole, it just doesn't flow together...the craftsmanship is great, but it ultimately was not an enjoyable experience.

"Love, Weddings & Other Disasters",4,30,audience,"walked out half way through, would have left earlier but thought ""It has to get better"" but it didn't."
"Love, Weddings & Other Disasters",4,30,audience,I really like Diane Keaton and watched it to see her but this character did not have enough depth. The whole idea that someone that fired 4 wedding planners before Jessie but they love everything she does isn't realistic. The movie is a Disney style fantasy and is so predictable. Acting was still good though.
"Love, Weddings & Other Disasters",4,30,audience,Very light romantic comedy. Liked the opening wedding party scene and game show segments the best!
"Love, Weddings & Other Disasters",4,30,audience,"So horrible, could barely get through it."
"Love, Weddings & Other Disasters",4,30,audience,Loved it. Don't know what critics' have problem with.
"Love, Weddings & Other Disasters",4,30,audience,"I gave it half a star only because I will watch Diane Keaton in anything.  This movie started off bad, failed to find any depth and ended worse than it started.  It was jaw dropping in its utter failure to entertain.  Not one character developed or surpassed one dimension.  The actor playing the Russian woman couldn't keep up the bad accent and was only really noticeable due to such a poor performance.  Stay home, watch Netflix.  At least you can change the channel."
"Love, Weddings & Other Disasters",4,30,audience,It was amazing hilarious yet heartwarming at the same time 100% recommended
"Love, Weddings & Other Disasters",4,30,audience,"This was a decent attempt at a romantic comedy.  Sure there have been better ones and worse ones, but what do we expect out of romantic comedies?  They are meant to be feel good films that help us through the day.  It is good to see Jeremy Irons back in action, his ability to tackle a more challenging role is always appreciated and hopefully will come soon.  There seems to be a potential of young actors & actresses that we should see soon in better productions.  Would love to see Maggie Grace in more challenging roles as she is ready to receive top billing and carry a movie, thinking action/suspense.  Also was very pleased to see Elle King and Keaton Simons and their wonderful music featured in the film."
"Love, Weddings & Other Disasters",4,30,audience,"Jeremy Irons and Diane Keaton had a brilliant career in the past, but seem very eager to work with Dennis Dugan trying to ruin any of that.

Remember when 60 minutes would actually verify facts and spend months digging and refuting claims? Yeah - we don't do that anymore. 

Very little time is spent on actual data, factual reconstruction, and careful analysis - but spends 90% of it's time looking into multiple possible D.B. Cooper suspects by simply reporting 2nd and 3rd hand opinions. They didn't even do a decent job digging into those claims. TV shows I watched did better jobs in 30 minutes.

Fun to leave running in the background while cleaning the house, but not much more."

The Mystery of D.B. Cooper,91,54,audience,Great documentary that covers the main DB Cooper suspects. Very well done.
The Mystery of D.B. Cooper,91,54,audience,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. There's a great balance of old footage and fresh film and they entwine it masterfully to bring the story to life and take you on the mysterious adventure of the search for D.B. Cooper. Of course the case has never been solved, but they manage to make you feel satisfied at the end although you don't have any answers and likely never will. ....


They begin by telling the tale of the highjacking, through interviews with the airline staff and passengers, both current and televised interviews from back when it happened. They stick to the facts of what happened but it's quite intense and intriguing. ....


They then start getting into the different suspects and go through two rounds of interviews with the family, friends, investigators and researchers who explain why they believe this specific man was D.B. Cooper. They're all fairly credible as they certainly believe their own stories and reasons and most are seemingly rational individuals - the ""proof"" they have for their respective suspects is pretty compelling. The second round of interviews fleshes it all out a bit more and adds more weight to each of their stories. ....


It's a fun and more lighthearted mystery than most whodunnits since no one was injured or killed in this crime and so many people could have been D.B."

The Mystery of D.B. Cooper,91,54,audience,"Very weak, there are youtube documentaries with better narrative and details than this production"
The Mystery of D.B. Cooper,91,54,audience,"Overall, those who enjoy documentaries about unsolved true stories will certainly find this pleasing. A story of a man who conducted a heist on a large plane and then parachutes out with no trace of him is certainly a story that fascinated me. It is unfortunate that the documentary can't reveal all the details and that the final conclusion will be left up to its viewers.  Pacing for the most part is pleasing and the quality of this documentary, including the film's visuals and interviews, are also quite positive.  Overall, this documentary comes highly recommended.  - Walkden Entertainment"

Uncle Frank,77,84,audience,"Paul Bettany gives life to this lively and soulful family drama that portrays the life of Frank, a southern gay man living his ""secret"" life down in '70s New York City. As much as we already ""know"" the essence of the film, Uncle Frank succeeds in giving us some amazing performances, a well-executed script, and direction, standing out from other gay-themed dramedies."
Uncle Frank,77,84,audience,"Everyone needs an Uncle Frank, but everyone deserves an Uncle Wally.

Writer/Director Alan Ball's Uncle Frank is obviously a very personal story as it is somewhat based on his own father's experiences, but what makes the film so transcendent is how as much as I was invested in the drama of the characters on screen, Ball's film made me look deep inside my own soul and reflect on shortcomings that hadn't even occurred to me until experiencing his film.

Being raised in Central Arkansas under the traditional thumb of the Catholic Church I had no idea what ""gay"" even meant until junior high or high school, so I sure as hell didn't have any idea I might have had a gay family member. It wasn't until 2013 at the age of twenty-six that I realized my own uncle had been keeping a secret from his family for what was at least my entire life and probably much longer. I didn't have a chance to speak to my uncle before he passed due both to unreconciled family drama and his deteriorating health. I'm also positive I said some things in front of him in my youth that would disappoint and destroy me now. Uncle Frank made me wish I'd been more like Sophia Lillis' Beth. It made me wish I'd been a better person, really. Both more understanding in my youth and more willing to strike up a conversation with my uncle in the brief window of time I had with him as an adult. I wish I'd talked to him enough to know he was hurting or hiding something, but I never bothered to ask - I never made a point to consider his life outside of what it meant to my own.

While the pain of this regret is new, deserved, and more devastating than I would have expected given the circumstances surrounding my uncle's death I also feel indebted to Uncle Frank for helping me realize how much I've grown and how much growing I still have left to do.

Cheers to Ball for the way in which he structures the unraveling of Frank's past, compassionately framing how Frank became the man he is when we're introduced to him.

Cheers to Paul Bettany, Peter Macdissi, and Lillis for genuinely strong performances and a chemistry that would make anyone want to join the trio on a road trip.

And cheers to the appropriately named Aunt Butch for being capable of more than we – and seemingly Frank – ever expected her to be. Also Margo Martindale. ""If being curly-headed is something that gets passed down, why not…"" What a treasure."
Uncle Frank,77,84,audience,"Loved this movie from the opening scene to the last. The poignancy of the story allows us to sympathise with characters on both sides of the issue, connected as they are by the love of the unconventional Beth (Sophia Lillis). My heart broke anew for the trials of those who were brave enough to express their sexual identity and individuality in a pre-enlightened era."
Uncle Frank,77,84,audience,Paul Bettany and Sophia Lillis deliver an engaging performance to keep you entertained in an already intriguing film
Uncle Frank,77,84,audience,"Frighteningly accurate depiction of what my southern family was like in the 1970s, complete with all the Christian hypocrisy and self righteous judgment. Despite that, the acting was awesome and the entire movie was touching. I'd like to watch more movies of the caliber and quality."
Uncle Frank,77,84,audience,"What a surprise! Great combination of interwoven plots and subplots covering years in the lives of interesting characters.  Smart dialog between characters whose paths you would never think should cross.  Paul Bettany is the complex, intelligent, metrosexual Frank with a past pain that causes angst when forced to go home again.  (The South always causes complexity to the simplest of life's stories.)   Watching coming-of-age Beth, played Sophia Lillas, mature as she engages her idolized uncle and his secret, surprise, but true and funny and loving partner, Wally, (Peter Macdissi), are the lens through which this story is told.  So happy I watched this intriguing film produced by Amazon Prime."
Uncle Frank,77,84,audience,"Great cast, awesome acting and it is truly heartwarming but well written story. Absolutely, I enjoyed watching it."
Uncle Frank,77,84,audience,"Paul Bettany is fantastic as Uncle Frank, a late 40s gay man taking a road trip home for for his father's funeral in the early 1970s. I found this film touching, funny and hopeful. Great actors who play young Frank and his best friend."
Uncle Frank,77,84,audience,Really good and emotional.
Uncle Frank,77,84,audience,"You know this isn't a bad little movie which deals, rather movingly, with a 'Coming-Out' story set in the USA in the 1970s, directed by Alan Ball.
It gives Paul Bettany the chance to star and he is remarkable good, in fact I would say he has seldom been better. There is genuine feeling between him and Peter Macdissi as his partner Wally and Sophia Lillis as Beth. Indeed, she really impressed me with her performance."

Uncle Frank, written and directed by Alan Ball, is clearly a drama, but it hides the true depths of its drama for much of the film.

Alan Ball's Uncle Frank is rife with potential, but in rushing the catharsis it fails to engage the viewer, and Frank remains as unknowable to us as he was in the beginning.

Hillbilly Elegy,26,85,audience,A complete disaster. Supposedly the book is good but it's hard to believe watching this tone deaf disaster.
Hillbilly Elegy,26,85,audience,"Yeah take me home country road. Based on the memoir, a Yale Law student drawn back to his Appalachian hometown reflects on his family's history and his own future.

This movie moved me to tears. I felt very bad for the main character and what he had to go through in his childhood as well as 14 years later. The story was heartbreaking and tough to watch at times. However, I was still hooked into the story and got on an emotional ride for the whole almost 2 hours runtime.

The acting was marvelous throughout, especially Glenn Close and Amy Adams as the grandma and the mom, respectively. Close as the grandma showed a person with certain regret in the past and tried her best in the remaining year taking care of our main character J.D. and made sure he had a chance of a bright future. Amy Adams was amazing as a mother who could have a great life, but was ruined because life didn't always go right. The character was maddeningly unstable, which made me feel more sorry for the character as well as those around her. 

The theme was about how individual choices can get one out of a tough and chained life. However, that life was still the main factor that shaped the person.

Overall, a beautiful and emotional movie that painted an ugly life and showed how one can still rise above that. 9.5/10

As for critics' ratings, they were absolutely ridiculous. Don't look at critics' rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but instead look at the Audience's rating, which better reflected the movie. As for previous movies, I was still confused and abhorred at how certain people use outside and unrelated politics to judge a movie. This movie was released around the peak time of the mess that was Trump's end of presidency. Somehow the movie's region's political affiliation and race was used as a major determination to rate the movie. This is toxic and head-scratching."
Hillbilly Elegy,26,85,audience,"Based on the memoir by J. D. Vance, it is unfortunately one of the weakest films of the year. A Yale Law student is drawn back to his Appalachian hometown after a family emergency and reflects on his family's history and his own future. Amy Adams and Glenn Close are the saviours of this story, some of the powerful scenes were challenging for the actresses, but the overall plot is messy and full of flashbacks here and there. I could think of better stories that tell the same tale of self-improvement with a poverty background."
Hillbilly Elegy,26,85,audience,"What seemed like a promising idea, was ruined by an overly melodramatic and performative execution. Glenn Close and Amy Adams always out there giving it all, but not even they were enough to save this seemingly endless and dull take on family and addictions, that just keeps on going to the same places over and over again."
Hillbilly Elegy,26,85,audience,"The worst thing about Hillbilly Elegy is that it deceives the spectator, making he think that he's watching a good movie. The ending has the only function to disguise the whole remaining in a feel good movie, and I must admit that it worked for me for a minute. But forgetting this remaining and thinking only about the last 2 minutes is not watching properly a movie. The soundtrack is bizarre, the editing does not make sense, the first hour is racking and the cast is terrible. JD kid is a boring child and JD adult reminded me of Noah Centineo. Amy Adams is untolerable and Glenn Close is stereotyped. I feel really bad for Ron Howard, Rush is one of my favorite movies. Where is his bravery that I saw 7 years ago?"
Hillbilly Elegy,26,85,audience,I wanted to like this movie. It felt overemotional and it played many stereotypes. The book is better (which is almost always the case). Prepare your expectations.
Hillbilly Elegy,26,85,audience,"Beautiful film, beautiful story by a truly great guy. J.D. Vance is the American dream"
Hillbilly Elegy,26,85,audience,This movie is a masterpiece! Amy Adam's deserve an oscar for her performance. 
Hillbilly Elegy,26,85,audience,"It's difficult to know where to begin with Hillbilly Elegy. In one sense, we have to consider the context of the individuals this story is about and in another we must accept this specific facet to be the truth of their lives. How does one reconcile that author J.D. Vance's memoir on which this film is based is both undoubtedly a vivid recollection of his own childhood as well as a romanticized portrait of a place in America where the pride of having been left behind has a lot to do with the refusal to move forward? The conflicted feelings about how and what the film is representing naturally extend to the DNA of the film itself as, in the opening moments, Gabriel Basso's Vance tells us how much he loved visiting rural Kentucky when he was a boy despite being raised in the rust belt of Ohio; it was the memories he made while visiting the Blue Grass State that he was most fond of. The film quickly contradicts these kind words with a scene where a thirteen year-old Vance (Owen Asztalos) encounters a band of local bullies before being rescued by his local relatives in Kentucky. Vance is obviously sentimental about these moments and has therefore made them more appealing in his memory, but how far does the gaze of these rose-tinted glasses reach? Depending on the author's age at the time of the events being described, what circumstances are being missed and what details are being diminished? How much is Vance actually misremembering? There are a lot of questions left unanswered that director Ron Howard doesn't feel the need to address as he largely focuses on the core family dynamic at the heart of Vance's story, but what's riveting about the execution of Hillbilly Elegy is that it feels the need to explain as much as it does chronicle the reasons these people have ended up the way they have. There is this notion that because they really are well-meaning people underneath their poor life choices that they deserve some type of exception when it comes to discussing said shortcomings. Aside from the complicated cultural discussion around the ""hillbilly condition"" though, and how sorry viewers should be made to feel for these individuals who can't get out of their own way, Howard and screenwriter Vanessa Taylor (The Shape of Water) smartly focus on the prevalent themes around how much community and family genuinely mattered to Vance while growing up in these undeniably unforgiving environments and the complexities of the problems he faced and deals with well into his adult life due to this jagged support system.

Hillbilly Elegy,26,85,audience,"4/5, 5 stars are to offset the absolute ridiculous ratings from the ""critics"". Decided to watch the movie thanks to the unbiased ratings from the audience and I can not comprehend how this could possibly deserve a 25% rating from the critics. Are they really that butthurt that the movie is about somebody who comes from a different background and had to fight hard to get somewhere, are most of the critics sad people who got higher education cause of their parents and then all they did with their lives is become movie ""critics""? Is that really the reason for the low ratings? If that is the case then this is just sad... you got enough movies about your type of NY socialites and stuff. Give the movie a try if you love a motivational story about fighting hard to achieve something. That is not my usual type of movie but it is incredibly well made and acted which is why my actual score is 4/5."

 "
I Am Greta,79,37,audience,"Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg is an inspiration.  This documentary film which follows her around like a puppy dog, isn't particularly insightful, but it doesn't have to be because every moment with Thunberg and her quest to save the planet is reason enough to watch.  Let's talk about the elephant in the room and why certain humans can't have nice things.  Here's some advice:  If you know you are not going to like something then don't watch.  We all know most of those people didn't view the doc at all, but if you did.. why?  Don't hate watch it's not good for the mind, body or soul. Final Score: 8.0/10"
I Am Greta,79,37,audience,"See in a theater. The sound design and soundtrack are impeccable and deserve something better than your home system. The pacing is perfect. It's a classic three act play, but doesn't strain to hit its marks. All the things you know about her story are here, but now with greater depth. To all the critics who need to dig at this maudlin masterpiece, you simply continue the long unforgivable decline of writing about cinema. To the Trump trolls who cratered the Audience rating in the first days/weeks of its release, maybe just see the movie first."
I Am Greta,79,37,audience,A poor attempt at creating a compelling story from nothing.
I Am Greta,79,37,audience,"Something people don’t understand and about greta is she is not some sort of manipulative propaganda that the media uses. She’s a passionate educated young girl that is worried for the future of her generation and the future generations. She’s a global hero and not enough people recognize that. But if your not going to recognize her heroism at least recognize the current problem and help fight for climate justice because there is absolutely no rebuttal again climate justice, climate justice is THE most important thing globally right now, please recognize that."
I Am Greta,79,37,audience,"A very powerful message from a little human in stature!

This documentary shows a young Swedish girl who sees the damages of climate change and is trying her best to do something about it. The movie unveils her determination and her courage to voice up the world's biggest existential issue, amid dead threats against herself and her family.
Her message carries her sincerity in this fight, it is truly powerful and inspiring. The documentation exposes her true personality and reveals her true-self. After seeing this documentary, I am convinced that no one can manipulate her. Why can't a teenager be smart? Why can't a teenager be a true leader? I am so proud of this Generation Z! This is a remarkable film showing the struggles and the journey of a remarkable person .

Thank you Greta for what you are doing to save our planet! You are no more alone!"
I Am Greta,79,37,audience,"Very inspiring to see her dedication to spreading the message related to CLIMATE CHANGE. It is real and it is an extinction level event if we don't act soon.

I VOTED for a future that will change our path toward RENEWABLE ENERGY. We need to use our voices as VOTERS to change the public officials in office, and hold them accountable to actionable change for the benefit of our FUTURE!

I think America needs to consider high speed rail (which can be powered by any electric source) between cities and states. That way we can begin to transition away from airlines for domestic travel. It seems like a daunting task, but as they say you eat an elephant one bit at a time.

I also think that instead of carbon credits and monetizing the green energy movement, we need to STRONGLY ENCOURAGE the FOSSIL FUEL industry to start innovating into the renewable areas. Imagine if EXXONMOBILE used its enormous MARKET CAPITALIZATION towards a future that doesn't harm the planet. I'm sure they could IMPROVE and INVENT new ways of capturing RENEWABLE ENERGY.  The oceans are constantly breaking waves (filled with energy just waiting to be captured and transmitted to shore). Entire sunny states like (NEVADA, ARIZONA, UTAH) could be hubs to build out massive SOLAR ARRAYS to transmit energy to other parts of the country. There is no excuse to be destroying our planet and poisoning our air and water to dig out (or pump out) fossil fuel related resources..."
I Am Greta,79,37,audience,"I Am Greta is a powerful film that documents the rise of the biggest movement on climate change that exists today. As a father of a young child, I can only hope that my daughter is half as dedicated, fearless and well adjusted as Ms. Thunberg. The adults that attempt to belittle her all end up looking like the real children in the film. The next generation is indeed watching us and they aren't impressed with what they've seen. Perhaps it's time we give Ms. Thunberg and her colleagues an opportunity to see if they can do better."
I Am Greta,79,37,audience,Fascinating insight into a remarkable young woman who is trying to save the world.
I Am Greta,79,37,audience,"Unfortunately really important since no one did something like this before.
Reading all the negative comments about the movie makes me feel the world is really sick and people need to die so we have a better world.
Thank you Greta for doing this and never stop being you. You are amazing!"
I Am Greta,79,37,audience,"Starting an international movement is not easy for a human who isn't seeking a personal spotlight, especially when the countries with the loudest mics have influencers doing all they can to look the other way, spitting at you in shamefully selfish fear and chosen naive denial."
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
Makes an immensely potent statement.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
The issue with I Am Greta, no matter how openly it presents its protagonist, is that it won't do precisely what Thunberg is devoting her life to: changing minds.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
The message of Greta Thunberg and I Am Greta is a grim one, but one with a shred of hope, knowing there are passionate people putting in the hard work toward change.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
I Am Greta promises insight that never appears.

A humanistic examination of this young activist.

[An] intimate portrait.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
I Am Greta is a stellar documentary that allows audiences to see Great Thunberg's determination but also reminds them that she is a child, carrying a responsibility that she should not have to shoulder
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
An enlightening documentary about a passionate young prophet for eco-justice.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
[The film] is a testament to commitment and passion. It's also a film that feels like it only scratches the surface about its subject, her family and, more so, her cause.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
While informative, ""I Am Greta"" takes a sheepish, non-committal approach to its subject that saps it of some its intended impact.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
It's a feature-length selfie with a figure who merits a painstaking portrait.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
Even more than describing her cause, the affecting ""I Am Greta"" introduces us to the person herself, digging deep into why she's pushing herself so hard, to do what our planet's adults apparently won't.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
Grossman's film makes you think and knows how to deliver a message, just like Greta herself.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
That the movie tries to be inspirational makes me wonder whether those moments of truth are accidental, and if this is ultimately just another example of patting Thunberg on the head and telling her how cool she is without really absorbing her message.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
Greta is an accidental hero of our times propelled to the world stage seemingly overnight, but that status suffocates and stifles her, as this doc highlights.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
We get a taste of just what this activism has cost her.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
The subject is more interesting than the film... It doesn't really tell us anything that we didn't already know about her and her cause.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
It wants to be a celebration of Greta, and so it misses the opportunity to go into other areas suggested by her circumstances.
 "
I Am Greta,79,37,critic,"
Likable, but not incredible... There's value in being reminded that there is a human beneath all those breathless headlines.

Atlantics,96,67,audience,There's nothing entertaining or movie worthy about the illegal invasion of Europe.
Atlantics,96,67,audience,Very slow and boring. A complete waste of my time.
Atlantics,96,67,audience,"This movie is slow and boring, and actually looks like a parody of an arthouse movie at times, with long uninterrupted shots of nothing happening, just waves or people sitting."
Atlantics,96,67,audience,"There was some nice (but not amazing) cinematography. If you love long shots of waves crashing, and people walking, or looking depressed, or pensive, or any other really bland emotions then this film is for you! Personally though I would have preferred more exposition and/or character development. Perhaps that would have been a better way to turn a 45 minute short into a 107 minute feature. But what do I know? The critics love it."
Atlantics,96,67,audience,"A brilliant debut by Mati Diop depicting the everyday life in Dakar with all its difficulties and beauty.
Diop masterfully balances between realistic narration and traditional influences combining a detective story with a mystical storyline.
Film is stunningly beautiful, skilfully joggling the colours and day-night perspectives.
A fresh and captivating kind of cinema."
Atlantics,96,67,audience,"Addresses a lot in a quiet, thoughtful, understated way."
Atlantics,96,67,audience,"Diferente, inesperado, con una trama cautivante a pesar de lo lento que a veces se pone, pero no aburrido. Muy buena"
Atlantics,96,67,audience,The film is so dragging and is a waste of an hour and 40 mins. Story could have been edited down to 30mins or less. I don't understand how this movie got such a high rating  Don't watch!
Atlantics,96,67,audience,Refreshing to see a movie so un-american or european/formulaic and so rawly original. Beautiful cinematography sweeps you away. A bit slow but you feel like you are in Senegal and it is very romantic and deep.
Atlantics,96,67,audience,"When we need supernatural elements in order to make us more human, maybe it's time to admit that we are doing things wrong. Bold film, with a powerful message."
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
Mati Diop's haunting Senegalese supernatural drama stages a tender ghost story to spotlight issues of migration, refugee crises, loss and intimate grief.
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
A poetic package crafted by writer/director Mati Diop.
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
The film would end up being just another genre-bending experiment if it wasn't for the documentary undercurrent that manifests all along its duration, or by how it finds in this documentary style an authentically fantastic edge [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
The film is moving and memorable.
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
Haunting each of its viewers in a way that can only be described as personal, Atlantics is a great start to a bright future for filmmaker Diop, as she is using the medium to tell a confident story that she knows best.
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
The stark reality of life in the post-colonial, post-industrial landscape of Dakar is transformed into the magical and meditative ... and Diop elevates the film from a sequence of events to a state of mind.
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
It's a joy to find a film that's brave enough to take chances, whether for better or for worse.
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
Rich soaking colors, lots of shots which emphasize the obstructions of the social/physical environment...
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
Diop's ability to alchemise her supernatural narrative with such effective social commentary is something very special.
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
This complicated but beautiful exercise in cinematography never denies the heart of its story. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
The film is as aesthetically beautiful as it is a visionary social commentary.
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
At its heart, Atlantics is a story about agency and the struggle to chart one's own path, free of societal constraints and expectations about what one should do.
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
Blending social realism with lyrical notes of horror, Diop runs through gender roles and how standing against the tide is the biggest quest of them all.
 "
Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
Atlantics depicts Islam with matter-of-factness: No explanation, no exoticization, nor hiding some of its uglier practices.

Atlantics,96,67,critic,"
In her stunning first feature, Atlantics, director Mati Diop has a knack for embracing the quiet and letting important moments breathe.

Knuckle City,100,71,audience,this movie is freaken amazing
Knuckle City,100,71,critic,"
Knuckle City is a truly authentic take on the boxing culture in Mdantsane, the boxing mecca of South Africa...
 "
Knuckle City,100,71,critic,"
Bathed in a sea of poverty and corruption, Knuckle City challenges traditional notions of masculinity to expose how toxic and destructive it is.
 "
Knuckle City,100,71,critic,"
Knuckle City doesn't seek to forgive these men and their deplorable actions, but instead contextualize where that ingrained misogyny, toxicity, and violence comes from.
 "
Knuckle City,100,71,critic,"
Qubeka's take on the boxing movie is a visceral descent into chaos, spurred by toxic masculinity and how it breaks the body and mind.
 "
Knuckle City,100,71,critic,"
absolutely riveting and just plain brutal. This film is gritty and intense and it grabs hold of you and doesn't let go.
 "
Knuckle City,100,71,critic,"
Knuckle City cannot be overlooked.

Leading man Mantsai is an especially riveting screen presence, solid as a one-two punch.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
Ricci is astonishing as Antigone. She has a way of demonstrating so much raw emotion in her gaze and when she looks directly into the camera in one scene, it is almost like she is peering into the soul of the viewer.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
...the film is carried by Ricci, a magnetic actress appearing in only her second role, who is wholly believable as a teenager whose greatest strengths...are also her greatest weaknesses.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
More than anything, it is a singular performance that demands attention and respect.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
The film works best when Antigone is representative of the immigrant rather than of her gender.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
A raw, electrifying study of race, poverty and indifference in the judicial system.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
[Nahema Ricci] illuminates the film with her powerful, tortured and inherently complex performance. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
[Director Sophie] Deraspe has made a film that it is immediate, visceral and vibrant, one that's worthy of its title and lineage.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
Now, thanks to Québécois writer-director-cinematographer [and co-editor] Sophie Deraspe ... , we finally have the film that [Jean] Anouilh deserves.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
Coming from the world of documentary, Antigone is an astonishing narrative feature debut for Deraspe, as well as a showcase for its young star's talents. Ricci conveys noble defiance in the face of injustice with emotional maturity.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
Deraspe earns kudos for making a 2,500-year-old play feel vital, contemporary and cinematic.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
This is powerful stuff with a quietly arresting performance by [Nahéma] Ricci whose character's strength shines through again and again.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
The stuff that lands carries a wallop.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
""Antigone"" views the plight of desperate immigrants through the lens of Greek tragedy, wringing compelling drama out of a situation that too often resembles catastrophe in the real world.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
Philosophically compelling and emotionally devastating, Deraspe crafts a unique and contemporary cinematic experience that resonates deeply.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
A contemporary spin on the Greek tragedy that feels refreshingly liberated by the spirit of Sophocles' original material, rather than slavishly devoted to its letter.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
Writer/director Sophie Deraspe's loose adaptation retains a fascination with the ties and responsibilities of family, but also develops into a timely reflection on the refugee experience.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
Sophie Deraspe's film adaptation of Sophocles' Antigone updates the central themes of the original -- family, exile, state power and sacrifice -- to reflect the struggles of a family of first generation Algerian immigrants in Montreal.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
[She leaves Sophocles' play's killing behind because her commentary on] race, poverty, police brutality, and heartless judicial systems reveals worse fates than death.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
The film is an incisive critique of the power imbalance between citizens and immigrants and the hypocrisy of an unjust justice system. It jolts the viewer out of complacency.
 "
Antigone,95,,critic,"
It's invigorating to see Antigone do justice to such a family and honor the complexities of their situation while delivering an emotionally direct and electrifying drama.
 "
Our Lady of the Nile,100,,critic,"
Our Lady of the Nile is ultimately about how the sad legacy of how hate can easily be passed from one generation to the next, but also how hard it is to escape inevitable violence.
 "
Our Lady of the Nile,100,,critic,"
A marvelous cast and an unusual history lesson.
 "
Our Lady of the Nile,100,,critic,"
Rahimi's film is a heart-breaking look at the corruption of innocence: breathtaking cinematography and a sprightly jazz-infused score bring out how sweet that innocence was, so it's all the more devastating to see it cruelly snatched away.
 "
Our Lady of the Nile,100,,critic,"
Director Atiq Rahimi has once again created a beautiful and disturbing work of cinema.
 "
Our Lady of the Nile,100,,critic,"
An engrossing tale of growing tension that explodes into violence.
 "
Our Lady of the Nile,100,,critic,"
They're coming of age amidst violence and imperialism, but the film's heart lies in the wide-eyed wonder of adolescence, so compellingly depicted by the first-time actors.
 "
Our Lady of the Nile,100,,critic,"
Frightening, sometimes confusing but strangely captivating, this is an unusual history lesson shot with verve and laced with violence.
 "
Our Lady of the Nile,100,,critic,"
If ""Our Lady of the Nile"" is ultimately not the definitive telling of the genocide, it is something equally valuable: the tragedy's illuminative prequel, a straightforward origin story faithfully adapted from an essential text.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
Niamh Algar is in crackling form here. She absolves the film of most of its flaws with a measured, understated performance of a working woman in an era that was on a freefall for almost everyone.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
Censor is a brilliant, original and head-in-the-door-slammingly creepy horror film.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
What's real and what's not as the internal tragedy of a trauma victim's brain spills out with real-life consequences. The imagery of a television tuned to snow is a brilliant symbol for the disturbed mind. There is no escape.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
Censor has plenty to say - through gore, visuals and a wallop of an ending - about difficult art and its place in society.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
The film's recreation of VHS horror aesthetics is amusing; not so much its retread of tropes of unreliable narrator and pop psychology in mastering childhood trauma.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
The retro-horror film Censor conjured fetishistic visions of early-'80s video stores, static-rippled CRT images and the zzt-zzt grind of VHS machinery.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
An entertaining psychological horror that pays homage to the ""video nasty"" era and horror scene in the '80s in a passionate and artsy manner.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
While the movie could've been a little deeper, especially in its exploration of censorship and the relationship between art and real-life, Censor is nevertheless still a solid debut from Bailey-Bond. It's an impressive horror.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
Censor wears its genre influences on its sleeve, but it's very much its own thing.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
Censor marries that grimy aesthetic with sneakier discussions about the things we repress even in the face of violence and trauma.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
Censor manages to fully exemplify a decade of filmmaking without devolving to the typical pastiche tropes.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
In the end, the best and worst things about Censor are exactly the same. It's that all of its most fascinating ideas and concepts are on its margins-rarely does it make anything explicit or obvious.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
Gleefully gory as you'd expect Censor digs into the history and the hysteria of the Video Nasties to deliver a devilishly clever story of one woman's descent into her guilt fueled madness.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
The film unfortunately pulls back from its social interrogation just when it's working up a head of steam.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
Despite its flaws, Censor shows us that Bailey-Bond is an inquisitive filmmaker who is willing to take risks.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
It's more than emulating a cinematic look, like those faux-gialli. It's creating an engrossing, disturbing, yet authentic world that cracks wide open like Enid's fragile psyche.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
While its ending doesn't deliver on its incredibly effective setup, [Niamh] Algar captures Enid's hollow-eyed, increasingly harrowed exhaustion as she tries to solve a mystery that nobody else believes in.
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
Genre buffs will have a blast watching it, but there is enough going on here to attract the kind of strait-laced viewer who would never dream of watching something entitled ""Driller Killer.""
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
The film is clever, inventive, and true to its time period...
 "
Censor,87,,critic,"
While 'Censor' shines in its evocative style and Algar gives it her all in a sensational performance, it pulls a few too many punches when you just want it to bring out the sledgehammer.

A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,audience,"Is our reality a genuine phenomenon unto itself, or is it the product of some elaborate computer-generated program? While this is a question that's fundamentally impossible to answer at this point in time, it nevertheless raises an intriguing possibility under the heading of ""simulation theory,"" a subject explored in varying degrees of success in this visually captivating and often-mesmerizing documentary. The content of director Rodney Ascher's big ""what if"" offering could use better focus in spots (especially in the anecdotal and speculative testimony of its avatar-costumed ""witnesses""), and the film could definitely stand to place less emphasis on the dark side of its subject matter (particularly in a questionable and overlong recounting of the role it played in a troubling criminal case). However, when it comes to examining such notions as deja vu, synchronicities and the Mandela effect, as well as the influential writings of such profound thinkers as Plato and author Philip K. Dick, particularly in the roles that they have played in the development of this notion, the film is truly at its best. For the skeptical out there, it may be easy to chalk up this material to stoner nonsense, silly speculation or oh so much intellectual masturbation, and those with such an outlook would be wise to skip this one and mull over their close-minded ideas in seclusion. But, for those who are amenable to opening their minds to potentially revolutionary perspectives on the nature of existence, this is a good primer. The implications, from things as simple as creating better video games to as complex as better understanding the very functioning of reality, are potential startling and exciting. And who would want to miss out on that?"
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,audience,The documentary barely scratches the surface of its concept. Comes across as more of a joke with paranoids using avatars. Such an interesting topic that the filmmaker doesn’t seem to grasp. 
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,audience,A movie featuring a series of anecdotal experiences from people that personify cognitive dissonance.
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,audience,This is a terrible movie. It is just people with no philosophical or scientific background saying “remember the Matrix movies” and talking about their own personal coincidences. They made a bigger budget conspiracy theory YouTube video. There is no attempt to make an argument for the Simulation Theory with any facts. Waste of time. I am interested in it the subject and this is by far the least valuable and most superficial look into the subject. 
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,audience,"Here's  what A Glitch in the Matrix is: Tech savvy people who took something of make believe; Computer Camelot , very seriously that just isn't there. Nothing new here. Instead of spirituality, religion, paganism or ritual that intertwines with nature and the unknown, we got believers in invisible godlike computers and video games as our reason we are here. Which sounds even more far fetched than many of the religious and spiritual theories we know of already . A man made thing is your God and creator ( a computer). What I see in this film is nothing new or special.  Its something that we've seen many times throughout civilization; very scared people that are terrified of the concept of their possible mind and body  irrelevance after expiration and mystery surrounding life so people come up with all sorts of ideas why we are here. Instead of spirituality and religion they substituted man made technology as the creator / God(s).   
Inevitable death is a terrifying realization for these people,  so they simply look for other answers instead of  facing that crude reality of biology ."
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,audience,I tried really hard to like this movie due to my interest in the subject. I couldn't get into the nonsensical ramblings of edgy neck beards who can't differentiate between what's real and what's a movie.
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,audience,I have been open to thought of simulation theory being very plausible. I watched Elon Musk on TED talk... watching this made me feel stupid that I would even entertained the idea...
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,audience,"This isn't a film. This is a poorly researched Reddit thread filled with nothing but anecdotal accounts ('evidence' would be too generous a word). At no point does it approach insightfulness on any subject. The filters used by the contributors make it feel like 4chan: The Movie. Your local gas huffer could better explore simulation theory - and form bettee argumentation - than this does. If it's meant to be more of a look at a certain subset of people, it fails by taking their views as fact; if it's meant to be a remotely serious exploration of simulation theory, it fails by coming off as a pseudo-conspiratorial YouTube video you'd catch your tween sibling watching at 4am."
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,audience,"Painful, it was painful to watch.  Its just a collection of anecdotes from from the contributor's childhood that obviously had a major impact on their lives but is meaningless to the observer.  And can we please move on from the idea that Elon Musk is some kind of genus, there's no there there.  Same can be said about the film. Of course the last story is so tragic it just leaves you crushed.  And to the  engineer from Harvard, if we were living in a construct why did you feel it necessary to tell us you went to Harvard, must be a program because every graduate from Harvard does it."
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,audience,"I believe in simulation theory, but this ridiculous zoom chat with digital cosplayers does nothing to further the argument."
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
Ascher's latest documentary shines a light on the philosophical and dangerous consequences of belief in the fast-spreading theory.
 "
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
Although based on an intriguing philosophical conundrum, A Glitch in the Matrix feels unreal on all fronts, poorly-researched, out of touch and vapid.
 "
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
Horrifying, but also funny...
 "
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
A Glitch in the Matrix feels like the worst party you've ever attended. It tackles the fascinating-and potentially dangerous-theory that we all live in a giant computer simulation. It does so in the dullest, most irresponsible ways possible.
 "
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
A production where the solipsism that's being dissected didn't bleed into the filmmaking. It's the movie that our version of A Glitch in the Matrix, brainy yet immature, started out as, but somewhere along the way, this file got corrupted.
 "
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
In the hands of a different filmmaker, could be engaging but one that Ascher largely fails to land. This will make you think, for a short while at least, but nothing much here will stay with you, in this reality or any other.
 "
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
A nutty, interesting and eye-rolling documentary about life as a simulation featuring people on a spectrum from nerdy, quirky outsiders to the homicidally deranged.
 "
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
It's really just a movie that gives a platform to several self-described video game addicts, who ramble on about how they sometimes have a hard time comprehending what's reality and what is not ... The movie is also very poorly researched.
 "

It's a necessary adjunct to the discussion. Sometimes, way-out ideas can yield real-world harm. Now more than ever.

A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
A Glitch in the Matrix is an engrossing feature that looks and feels unlike anything else out there in any genre or style in filmmaking.

It's an obvious conclusion that any rational person should have already come to on their own.

A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
This documentary from the director of Room 237 is eerily now.
 "
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
'A Glitch in the Matrix' takes on the task of explaining ""simulation theory"", where it comes from, what it is, and how so many have used the theory to describe some pretty disturbing behavior.
 "
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
A mix of science-fiction with reality, this is a movie that's fueled by pure curiosity. It's a documentary for anyone interested in contemplating deeper meaning, even if it is presented by ideas that may seem wild.
 "
A Glitch in the Matrix,69,19,critic,"
""A Glitch in the Matrix"" mostly offers theories based on countless what if's. But it's an absorbing experience.
 "
Supernova,87,70,audience,"Supernova is a moving, intimate representation of dementia and the harsh, emotional aftermath for both the sufferer and the caretaker, lived up by two powerful, heartbreaking performances by Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth. A portrait of true, unconditional love.

Supernova,87,70,audience,"Beautiful story, music and cinematography. Terrific acting. Very timely story."
Supernova,87,70,audience,"The problem with the movie is that Stanley Tucci seemed not nearly as demented as demented as he was supposed to be,  But Colin Firth was really good."
Supernova,87,70,audience,"Supernova is all about the little moments. It's restrained filmmaking that often feels like its just pulled the curtains back on these two mens lives and we now have a window to it, for a limited amount of time. Firth and Tucci do devastatingly beautiful work in their roles, even when the story lacks a structure to properly frame them."
Supernova,87,70,audience,"I guess Hollywood is beyond woke, except when it comes to casting gay men as gay men. "

Supernova,87,70,critic,"
Most certainly well worth the ticket price for these two fine actors alone.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
There's a beautiful intimacy and unrelenting affection in Supernova. It is the best love story brought to the big screen in years.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
You're living in these moments with these characters...the most naturalistic set of performances we've seen in a while.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
...a beautiful portrait of a couple fighting against time and slowly coming to terms with the realities facing them.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
What is captured powerfully in this deceptively simple drama is the idea that these lovers are also old friends. Firth and Tucci disappear into their roles as the middle-aged couple who have eaten thousands of breakfasts and travelled countless roads.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
SUPERNOVA is a gripping story about love and how to deal with grief from a different perspective. With incredibly moving performances, the film is one that will tug at your heart and bring you to tears.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
A long-term couple faces the heart-breaking reality of mental decline in this warm yet confronting drama.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
Listless and drab, and perversely free of emotions for a movie that is about literally nothing else other than the looming terror of death.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
Elegant and elegiac, haunting and, at times, harrowing, little-known British writer-director Harry Macqueen's understated drama is a heartwrenching study of love and loss.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
Here as ever, Tucci is the most charming of performers. But something about the use of celestial metaphors and, more generally, the treatment of dementia seems heavy-handed.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
Supernova is small pools of warmth along a long, dark street, walked in the company of wonderful guys I wish I knew and could spend an evening with some time...
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
Supernova very movingly accepts the reality of a looming collapse that no road trip can run away from.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci are convincing as a middle-aged gay couple dealing with dementia.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
Despite the performers' commitment-if also, to an extent, because of it-this movie ends up feeling like a pretentious tearjerker. It is one very much designed to let its stars run the gamut of ""noble sacrifice"" histrionics...
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
The film accordingly owes a great deal of its power to its actors, who are, of course, more than merely plausible as longtime partners, whose way through the small dramas of the everyday is the movie's real substance.
 "
Supernova,87,70,critic,"
By the time Tusker and Sam reach the end of the road - both metaphorical and literal, as this is as much a travelogue of England's Lake District - Supernova feels less like a film to cherish and more a tweet to favourite.

Sputnik,89,71,audience,"Slow burning thriller that will keep you engaged even though such a theme has been tried out several times before. It does seem like a blend of several alien sci-fi horror movies, but the music give you the chills and makes you forget all that."
Sputnik,89,71,audience,A interesting Sci-Fi Flick This horror is worth watching
Sputnik,89,71,audience,"I had high expectations and was a little disappointed.  It's distracting when you keep thinking ""what on Earth is her motivation for doing that?"""
Sputnik,89,71,audience,excellent and a nice snub to hollywood
Sputnik,89,71,audience,"SPUTNIK is a tight creature feature with some freaky scifi elements. I wasn't completely blown away but it was creative enough to keep my attention. It's interesting, too, to see imaginative and innovative movies come out of Russia or about Russia but I didn't really get a Russian feel from it. I don't know if it was the limited setting but it felt like this story could've taken place in any country and I would've suspended my disbelief teh same. It's worth wathing for anyone who likes alien scifi creature features."
Sputnik,89,71,audience,15.02.2021 ---------
Sputnik,89,71,audience,The Russian Venom. Good thriller.
Sputnik,89,71,audience,Russians over here making great horror movies while American Hollywood can't stop pushing radical liberal agendas.  GOOD. WATCH IT.
Sputnik,89,71,audience,"Overall, as a directional debut, this is an excellent film. Those seeking a sci-fi and horror film should look no further. Sure, the plot outline has similar concepts to something we have seen before, but thankfully there are many elements which are new and unique to see on screen. Leading performance from actress Oksana Akinshina is fantastic, and I loved many aspects of her character, such as the strength she brought on screen. The visuals, effects, and sound design (including the film's soundtrack) are also top-notch.  I gained plenty of enjoyment from this new and exciting cinema release and have no issues recommending it to many - Walkden Entertainment"
Sputnik,89,71,audience,"This movie had potential, it was a cool concept but ended up being incredibly generic. The first half keeps you intrigued, in the second half almost all the mystery is gone and it turns into a typical good vs bad slog to the finish line.

I audbily laughed at the ""big reveal"" of who the orphanage kid was. Its the main character! WOW! Who cares? What an terrible, inconsequential sequence that added absolutetly nothing to the story."
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
Sputnik is a chilling cold war era sci-fi horror hiding its heart in a pile of guts. It's an absolute must-see for space race nerds and pure nightmare fuel for space horror fans.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
One of the best films of its type to hit movie theaters - excuse me, home-entertainment centers - in many a moon.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
Sputnik is a confident debut from Abramenko, who demonstrates a mastery of the genre by paying homage to the sci-fi of the past while also creating something unique and breathtaking.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
Thankfully, none of it feels stale, even if it does more or less follow a familiar pattern.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
As metaphors for this ugly moment in history go, Sputnik is one of the best.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
Though it requires a bit of patience, those who stick it out will be rewarded as this thriller grabs you in the gut without insulting your intelligence.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
Sputnik is a steadfast and dependably gory outing that puts just enough of a twist on familiar material to make it enjoyable.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
Sputnik offers terrific Halloween-weekend viewing.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
a surprisingly intelligent, compelling, and (yes) very icky piece of science-fiction horror.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
As the scientist who becomes attracted to her patient, Akinshina gives a strong performance...
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
Those dark nights of the soul are the torment you'll take away.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
There are some great FX moments that'll make you go ""eww"", calling to mind those old-school horror films such as The Thing and Creepshow that combined fascination with revulsion.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
...the escalating tension, the skillfully realised horror set pieces and the solid cast all make this tale gripping and engaging.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
Abramenko takes on the epic space narrative with fresh eyes and a steady hand. Sputnik has a professional finish even as it has a bit of a B-movie plot, and each stylistic influence is nodded to with profound affection.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
It's messy but ultimately, the movie delivers with a slow burn trait that makes it a worthy foreign horror movie. [Full review in Spanish].
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
We...get a pretty entertaining thriller out of what's here, no matter how the finale sets up and how the picture resolves itself.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
The look of the film is impressive, making the most of dimly lit locales and labyrinthine corridors to craft several exquisitely suspenseful sequences.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
The movie's major disappointment is ironically Tatyana herself, who spends much of the first half as a complex personality bent on discovery, only to deteriorate into a one-dimensional heroine who becomes practically angelic by the end.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
Sputnik remains one of the most interesting Alien homages I've seen. Like Alien, its focus is on understanding the organism and its interactions with humanity but it's anchored in people.
 "
Sputnik,89,71,critic,"
There are several interesting political themes hidden beneath the surface of this Russian horror film, but they only serve as the basis for a generic story that fails to get off the ground. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Amulet,71,41,audience,"Weird, kind of cerebral, surprising at times and a twisty ending. Worth a look for a really interesting and unusual film experience. Parts of it make you go ""what?"" and parts you have to decide for yourself. Carla Juri as Magda is fantastic, and gets better and better as the film progresses."
Amulet,71,41,audience,"After watching three terrible horror films in a row, 'Amulet' was a welcome retreat, taking its sweet time to unravel."
Amulet,71,41,audience,"As someone who loves slow-building, atmospheric horror, this should have really done it for me. But the screenplay and structure of the story just feel too sloppy to fully get into it. I appreciate the way this takes its time in building mood but definitely needed a different approach on how the narrative was constructed. Ari Aster fans will probably dig this though. The ending feels straight out of something he'd do."
Amulet,71,41,audience,Challenging and fascinating. And pretty f’d up.
Amulet,71,41,audience,"Creepy, moves slowly, and at the end leaves you asking wtf did I just watch?! Imelda Staunton makes it worth watching."
Amulet,71,41,audience,Awkward soldier guy rapes old ugly woman in woods. Feels bad. After war he lives in homeless shelter which burns down. Evil lady posing as nun takes him to another house but this time its a place where they cook food that makes men shit bats.  Horror at its finest. Takes about 2 hours to get what's going on because there isn't much of a script.
Amulet,71,41,audience,"Certainly creatively creepy, especially the end. It was slow during much of the movie, then it gets very weird.  The impression it leaves is that someone really doesn't like men or at least thinks they're a lower form of life. Now that I've seen it and know, I probably would have skipped this movie."
Amulet,71,41,audience,"What a deep and hauntingly reflective movie, I don't agree with the bad reviews and feel what this movie lacks in jumps and scares is rewarded with validation of the more key elements (completing the story, excellent acting and character development) and constantly pulling the rug from under you in the end. You will see things in this movie and feel things you've never seen in a film before period. Like it or leave it that much is true."
Amulet,71,41,audience,This movie is crap. Literally a dollar would be to much budget to spend on such a boring non interesting film. I think honestly low budget movies are better. I stopped caring about the plot or characters. It does the opposite of sucks you in. I was hoping this was a artsy movie or one with talent. Instead those around either fell asleep or just couldn't wait for the credits to see who stole a hour and 39 minutes we won't get back. Its not even good enough to white my but with. Honestly toilet paper holds more value. I rather take a clever and chop of one finger then the next and though painful may be less painful and more enjoyable then such a crappy movie.
Amulet,71,41,audience,"Thought it was great. I immediately wanted to watch it again with a better understanding. Not sure why it is panned so much. It can be slow, but I never thought it was boring. Great performances by the three main characters. Trippy twists that weren't obvious. Left just enough questions open and had replaying things in my head as I fell asleep. Sad it gets a similar rating to so many garbage horror movies. It did a lot of things very well."
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
AMULET is a well done and affecting film of justice coming to the perpetrators of violence through means you would not normally expect. Quiet but unrelenting, it winds its tentacles around those who imagined that they had gotten away clean.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
Amulet is a horror film that masquerades, holding its secrets tightly within itself, waiting till the right moment to spill forth truly fantastical truths, letting its madness run amok in your brain.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
Amulet might fade into obscurity as one of many quiet, borderline indecipherable indie horror films in the world. As it stands, it's an interesting entry into an evolving horror sub-genre that I wholeheartedly look forward to seeing more of.

Amulet,71,41,critic,"
Demons from the past come alive in Romola Garai's surreal feature length debut. [Full review in spanish]
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
...the most technically ambitious of these films, and through the first two-thirds, at least, it's jaggedly compelling...
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
There's certainly something captivating about [Garai's] approach to the genre.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
This debut film from Romola Garai is to be commended on all levels: its technical proficiency, its aesthetic beauty, its affecting and unusual story, and its stand out performances.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
This odd, offbeat, and visually fascinating horror fable may meander a little, but its final destination makes for one of the most memorable scary tales of the year.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
I didn't understand the start of this movie; I didn't understand the middle of this movie; I didn't understand the end of this movie. It gets a few points for creepiness but that's all.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
Creepy, bloody, and flat-out weird in places, Amulet is a bold directorial debut for Garai and a disquieting reminder that getting rid of the past is never very easy.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
The boldly ambitious and psychedelic Amulet is ultimately too cryptic for its own good; you are unsure of the characters' motivations or what exactly Garai is trying to say.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
Amulet is a bold and impressive directorial debut.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
It's a promising film for a promising director, one who still hasn't arrived but has been noticed.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
A moody, disturbing, and very peculiar directorial debut. Perplexing? Sure. Mesmerizing? Definitely.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
Amulet certainly deserves a lot of credit for having some twist-filled elements that add intrigue to the story. It's too bad that these plot twists arrive so late in the film ... The weak links are the movie's screenplay, editing, and overall direction.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
Brutal monster movie is twisted but artfully gooey.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
Amulet is an unnervingly satisfying film that conjoins artful Rosemary's Baby-adjacent dread and Evil Dead-style ghoulishness with surprising aplomb.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
This horror flick seems gone awry, but actors give it a grand try!
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
All the actors are ultimately forced to play into a strategy of leaving key motivations unspoken (and sometimes obtuse even when they are spoken), and eventually the movie suffers.
 "
Amulet,71,41,critic,"
A stylish, satisfying writing/directing feature debut from Romola Garai.
 "
Driveways,100,85,audience,"A beautiful, quiet, slow but not dull, gem. It's realistic and has heart. It resonates and is memorable."
Driveways,100,85,audience,Understated and powerful. This movie is simply about being a good person - which is difficult to achieve without being patronizing. Driveways is an inspiring story bursting with genuine heart.
Driveways,100,85,audience,"Nice TV movie. It didn't feel like a new story or anything, but the character development and relationship between the kid and the old neighbor was cool. The kid was like an old soul and the two had a good understanding of one another. Hong Chau was excellent in this film as well. Not the happiest of movies but when you read between the lines and understand the story's message you will agree with it."
Driveways,100,85,audience,Slow burn. Very human story.
Driveways,100,85,audience,"A great movie about values, and overcoming loneliness."
Driveways,100,85,audience,Awesome. Heart warming.
Driveways,100,85,audience,"Despite the slow and meandering pace, it paints a real picture of loneliness, kindness, and connection."
Driveways,100,85,audience,"I almost never watch dramas, and that's all this movie is. Still, this movie prevailed and for me will be one of those ones that you think about for the next few weeks. Rest in peace Brian Dennehy."
Driveways,100,85,audience,"A movie with bottomless compassion for its characters and the audience. The story feels both familiar and new, probably because of the way it lingers on certain small moments of pain or joy."
Driveways,100,85,audience,Loved this movie SO much!
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
There is nothing flashy about Driveways, and that's why it works so well. It has a small, heartfelt story filled with winning characters that is as effective as any other movie at delivering big emotion.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
You'd have to have a heart of stone to not want to reach out and hold hands with the characters by the end.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
The movie acknowledges both Dennehy's extraordinary physical presence, and that time even breaks down someone like him.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
Driveways isn't simply one of the late Brian Dennehy's final performances-it's also one of his finest.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
Although the languid pace won't serve every viewer's motivation, Ahn manages to give the story a nice simple touch and warm coloration.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
One of Dennehy's best performances in one of his best movies.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
For one of his last films, Brian Dennehy has a small gem here.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
[This] gentle and sweetly endearing...tale of a lonely eight-year-old boy who befriends the elderly Korean War vet next door is defiantly positive; a big wet kiss on the lips of a world that normalizes cynicism and celebrates conflict.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
In times of cultural crisis, narratives like this remind us that change often happens locally, through the people we get to know, and learn to love, right next door.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
Quite a feat for an 83-minute character study that, I assure you, is small only in size...
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
What resonates is the movie's understanding of how we come and go through life, of how a house becomes a home, of how even the smallest acts of kindness can open doors that never quite close.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
""Driveways"" is a sweet, funny and genuinely moving tale that features Dennehy at his subtle best.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
The three lead actors carry the movie and do the heavy dramatic lifting gracefully; their sheer presence reaches far beyond the confines of the story.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
Rewarding gem about friendship and life's changes; swearing.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
""For a movie about isolation and the risk of reaching out, it's a generous example of how nourishing a sense of connection really is.""
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
Driveways doesn't necessarily provide answers, but it looks to find solace in decisions, with the lives we choose to leave, and the relationships we forge.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
Done so well and so delicately...unforced, beautifully performed, understated and quite lovely...I liked the feel and texture of this movie...the intimacy of it.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
Brian Dennehy delivers devastating low key turn as kind but also gruff Korean war vet, who befriends lonely boy. Hong Chau is another big plus
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
It is quiet and earnest and less than 90 minutes long. And if you watch it, it will make you feel better.
 "
Driveways,100,85,critic,"
...disarming and sincere.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,audience,"I was excited going into this film as I had previously seen and heard good things about it. I'm not quite sure we saw the same movie. THE LODGE has elements of THE SHINING and HEREDITARY but tried too hard to be smart. A lot of themes are touched upon such as family, isolation, nature, childhood trauma. However, religion is the biggest one and it's at first done in a subtle way but by the end of the film, it becomes heavy handed. It's unfortunate because the film had some potential. A slow burn so I was willing to give it some time to cash in but by around the halfway to three quarters point of the film, it got snowed in in my eyes."
The Lodge,74,51,audience,Heh. Tiddies. Good movie
The Lodge,74,51,audience,I watched it with my slave and boy oh boy did i waste my time. Not only is the movie incredibly boring but the only character that i enjoyed was the dog!! and it died so overall 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life are gone. ❤️❤️
The Lodge,74,51,audience,"This is an entertaining psychological horror movie but it has a slow build-up of story revelation so I won't be surprise if you will find it boring or some parts of it as boring. But the scenic backdrop of winter snow and isolated lodge where all the horror setting of the movie happens makes up for the atmospheric horror of The Lodge. Its horror is like a slow creeping tension that is induce in every scene that does not warrant fear or jump scares to see and feel its horror. The casts gave justified acting performances which helped the movie elevate its likability among the audience. While I find the acting in The Lodge as compelling and praise-worthy and the story was effective in delivering its psychological horror genre, the weakness I find in this film were need for more background details to Grace Marshall's character and cliff-hanging scene of the film's ending."
The Lodge,74,51,audience,"Dosent make any sense. The story, the acting, the place where it happens... Everything just feels wrong. No suspense, no horror, just plain waist of time.."
The Lodge,74,51,audience,"Definitely one that will stick with me. Although you could basically tell how the story would end up, it kept you guessing well enough throughout it. Very dark, psychological horror."
The Lodge,74,51,audience,Great story from the beginning until the middle of the movie. Too bad the ending is a huge disappointment. What a waste of time.
The Lodge,74,51,audience,"Long, drawn out, moved at a snails pace, over-the-top brain washing, unrealistic, too many holes."
The Lodge,74,51,audience,A drabby psychological thriller that walks the line of insanity.
The Lodge,74,51,audience,"Honestly, it was promising at the start. I didn't mind the slow-burn plot, as I generally enjoy such movies. It was the twist that ruined it for me. Even with the great camerawork and atmosphere, I just couldn't get over the AWFUL twist.
(SPOILERS)
I couldn't find any sympathy for the characters, especially the kids. The whole twist of the movie is that the two kids have come up with this elaborate plot to reveal that Grace is a psychopath and to get her out of their life. I feel as though we're supposed to cheer for them to fix the mess they caused, but they don't, and at the end of the movie I'm just frustrated. What kind of children find that an okay thing to do to a person? No matter who they are, that's a horrendous thing to do and I don't buy that these kids are THAT level of messed up. What seemed promising just turned into a confusing, unbelievable, and frustrating plot."
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
Compared with old Hammer horror films, there is more atmosphere, but the same or less character development. While not quite up to Hammer's LET ME IN or THE WOMAN IN BLACK, it has its moments.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
The Lodge may be mostly set in the great outdoors it is, nonetheless, a claustrophobic thriller that plays on dark psychological trauma.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
A one-way road trip to atmospheric terror.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
Irredeemable shite. ""The Lodge"" is a mean-spirited, ignorant assault on Cinema, and on its audience.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
I could not wait for this movie to end, but then I am not a fan of this sort of movie anyway. It is a particularly bad viewing choice on a cold, snowy winter's night when I am feeling isolated by a deadly pandemic.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
Perfectly paced, each film places viewers in purgatory along with the protagonists.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
A deliberately ambiguous and paranoid work, provoking the audience not only to speculate on each character's motivation but what precise kind of a thriller the film is.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
The most bone-chilling developments come not from the supernatural but from the human psyche, and the bleak ironies may stick with you long after watching.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
I feel like [the storyline's] completely original and completely well-thought-out.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
The Lodge suffers from an exceedingly (and excessively) deliberate midsection that pushes the slow-burn aesthetic well past its breaking point...
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
this new spin on old fairy tales tropes is loaded with great performances, fun jolts, and unexpected surprises
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
Chilling in its constant ambiguity, Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala's film thrives in keeping the viewer in a perennial state of suspicion over the characters' motives.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
The Lodge is the latest high brow horror delight with a hard focus on characters who are very uncomfortable around each other. Add in a dash of religious cult repression and you got yourself a solid horror flick in the vein of The Shining and The Thing.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
The pacing of The Lodge is meant to bring a slow burn to its suspense, but the movie seems to forget there's really no suspense at all to this story and its inevitable ending.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
Its terror is a slow, methodical, building dread that seeps into your bones and lives within you, like a bad memory you can't forget.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
The Lodge holds firm on its promise of a psychological horror, throwing the audience right into a mind-bending story that will have you as shaken as its characters.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
If there's a reason to watch The Lodge, it's Keough, who resists the urge to go Full Collette in her depiction of spiraling despair. It's a controlled performance in a film that tries its very best to push her into hysteria.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
Artfully contracted and meticulous to the point where it loses any feeling, The Lodge ultimately mires down in its own brooding, like its stuck in a snowdrift.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
It's a feel bad film that is still absolutely mesmerizing and you can't stop watching every minute of it until the shocking climax of the film.
 "
The Lodge,74,51,critic,"
An expertly constructed horror film, more interested in the elliptical manipulation of moods than straight shocks to the senses.
 "
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,audience,"A wonderful live-action, retelling of the Grimms fairy tale. I find it interesting that they transposed the names in the title, giving Gretel top billing and I can understand why after viewing it. As much as Hansel is a vital part, this is Gretel's story. Beautiful scenery along with a nice, tight story really made this a pleasurable viewing experience. Natural light is used somewhat throughtout, however, in other scenes, the use of colors is very reminiscent of the original SUSPIRIA. Likewise, the use of nature and with this being a fairy tale, it also reminded me somewhat of THE WITCH in it's storytelling. Alice Krige stands out the most as the Witch (or Holda as she's called here) and young Sophia Lillis continues to impress at her young age with another great performance after going 2 rounds with Derry's menacing clown. Finally, I thought using the 1.55:1 aspect ratio was a bold but brave move; one in which I applaud and enjoyed. It works in 2 ways: the first being a symbol of the closeness between the 2 siblings, as they have no one else to rely upon other than each other after being thrown out by their mother. The second shows the confinement the children (and audience for that matter) have in relation to the Witch, where there is no hiding underneath her roof. Looking forward to seeing this again!"
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,audience,"Maybe I missed something...
I know the story as a kid, and I went in expecting this to be scary and totally different from the story as a kid, the same as they have turned other childhood stories into horror films. This film missed a lot of opportunities to develop the story to make it a great horror film. It was very boring, confusing and not scary at all. It seem like it was a prequel to a much bigger story. I wouldn't waste my money going to the theater to see this, wait until it hits DVD or a streaming app."
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,audience,"Another politically correct movie with forced black actors in white roles.
This tendence of globalist media to put blacks in all white european cultural and historical roles is sickening audience and cause of racism ."
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,audience,One of the worse movies I've seen this year
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,audience,"Gretel & Hansel won't make you cower in fear, but thanks to Sophia Lillis and Alice Krige delivering a memorable performance, and great camera work with its story, the movie is enjoyable for a larger half of its runtime. It seems the first act is rushed, and takes the audience in to its great middle portion too quickly. The final act is rushed as well, leaving some viewers slightly unsatisfied."
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,audience,"Although the film is entertaining, it ends up flopping on its backside at the end of the day."
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,audience,One of those movies that will rely on one scene to wrap up what happened whole movie. Nothing is what happened.
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,audience,"Not only did the ""jump scare dream"" cliche 6 times throughout the movie, 6 DIFFERENT TIMES, the movie is so bland and boring that I don't care about anything, it's not even a Hansel and gretel movie, it just has the title, this movie is so stupid, and boring, and lame, and boring"
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,audience,Hard to follow. Extremely boring. Poor dialogue. Terrible special effects. Complete waste of time.
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,audience,Deftly stylized indie horror/thriller featuring some ideal casting and unnerving atmosphere.
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
Gretel & Hansel is witchier than any other version of the story and has some genuinely creepy moments but comes just shy of making a lasting impression.
 "
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
Perkins has a knack for knowing even the specific shapes and colors that will maximize creepiness.
 "
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
I was almost enchanted by Gretel and Hansel's feast for the eyeballs, but it's mostly just a bunch of empty gothica.

Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
Beautiful to look at but lacking in many other aspects required to elevate it to above-average levels.

There are quite a few interesting ideas in Osgood Perkins' ""Gretel and Hansel,"" making its botched execution all the more frustrating.

[Director Oz Perkins'] most ambitious work. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
Just like a witch's spell that makes something rotten appear to be enticing, Gretel & Hansel is a horror movie that looks visually thrilling, but it's really an ugly mess.
 "
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
Despite its slow spots, Gretel & Hansel is a refreshing and visually inventive spin on a very old tale that cautions perception and things that lie beneath the surface.
 "
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
You know where all this is going - or perhaps you don't, I suppose, but you won't be particularly impressed when it gets there either way.
 "
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
The entirety of the film is built on a tension as delicious as the witch's sweets.
 "

Aside from the mildly femenist aspect, there's not much to hightlight about this new adaptation from director Oz Perkins. [Full review in spanish]

Gretel's powers appear to come from the Force to such a degree that one can't help but wonder if she's related to the Skywalkers.
 "
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
It will make you sleepy, without scaring you at all...
 "
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
Creates a lot of surreal imagery just with a low camera, creating space in a room or the woods around Gretel. She begins to fill the frame more and more as the camera gets closer, gradually changing the feeling of the scene.
 "
Gretel & Hansel,64,23,critic,"
Even at only 87 minutes the film feels stretched out, neither pushing its pungent ideas nor becoming properly scary.

The Night,80,68,audience,"If you consider yourself a Horror fan, there is  no excuse to not checking this film out the first chance you get."
The Night,80,68,audience,"The one night could be ordinary or a living nightmare for an entire family.
IFC pictures and director Kourosh Ahari present a haunted-house psychological horror pic.
After leaving a party with family an Iranian husband, wife, and their baby decide to stay in a hotel in Los Angeles. It's called Hotel Normandie but nothing is what it seems.
Both of them start to see hallucinations of their demons; this place acts like quicksand. The more you struggle the deeper you get in.
They start seeing things from black cats to a homeless man to a small boy. Is the hotel manager even real?
They'll both have to try to admit their darkest secrets to make it out.
There's all kinds of clever tricks of the mind here it almost has that Stanley Kubrick feel.
I give them credit for plenty of uneasy nightmarish visuals.
The ending is a tad confusing though. 
But the true scares come not just from the frights coming at these two people but the actual horrors they've kept locked away inside.
A decent first time directorial effort with a real sense of dread and effective atmospherics."
The Night,80,68,audience,"Atmospheric, Stylish Psychological Horror"
The Night,80,68,audience,"Stunning cinematography, chilling suspense, and a beautiful glimpse into Iranian culture. Was on the edge of my seat the entire time! 

It is such a shame it did not get any Golden Globe nominations, even if just as a political move. We need more foreign films like this highlighting overlooked communities particularly devoid in Hollywood. 

Much watch!!!!"
The Night,80,68,audience,The acting in this movie. My god. 
The Night,80,68,audience,"I am a big fan of psychological thrillers and this hit all the nerves. I was not crazy about the very end, but I definitely recommend a watch!"
The Night,80,68,audience,"No creepy monsters, no psycho killer on the loose and, no gory death scenes and, yet The Night seems to find a way to be one of the most unsettling horror films I've seen in a long time."
The Night,80,68,audience,"Great horror movie that is subtly creepy and I love how it uses the Zoroastrian theme of truth.  Not an overcomplicated plot, which seems to be problem of a lot of movies, and everything ties in nicely. The final shot gives a great chill."
The Night,80,68,audience,This film sells itself as an intellectual horror thriller but it resorts to a few lazy jump scares and lacks any lasting momentum. The ending becomes clear about 25mins before you get there but I kept watching hoping there might be a better twist. *spoiler* there wasn't.
The Night,80,68,audience,A psychological thriller ride that hits all the right notes towards the buildup.
The Night,80,68,critic,"
The big reveal in the film is not as surprising as it is heartbreaking. And the impact that this revelation might have on viewers is what makes The Night a horror movie that wants people to think about issues that are larger than a ghost story.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
a film that doesn't just make us tense up and jump, but rather feel for the protagonists as they must face down all the demons they have tried to hide within
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
A goosebumps-inducing affair, ""The Night"" is at its most effectively unsettling when the focus is to evoke fear as opposed to when it physically shows what's haunting the characters trapped in their respective secret tragedies.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
The Night is more about sustained creepiness than actual big scares
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
The Night unfortunately does not live up to the expectations it sets for itself and the expectations of a genre.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
It's a carefully laid-out picture, albeit perhaps a bit too restrained to become anything more than solidly unnerving. Still, strong moments abound.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
The film results more formulaic than twisted.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
It turns into a pretty good horror pic (however there are reservations over its logic).
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
A synchronous collection of horror tropes keeps up the pressure from beginning to end.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
The great strength of  The Night is the acting talent on display.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
The first US-produced film to receive distribution in Iran in four decades, Kourosh Ahari's The Night is also one of the very best horror movies I've seen in recent years, rich in atmosphere and clever storytelling.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
The Night is polished and has some visual atmospherics, but its fantasy logic isn't very well worked out, while its scares are pretty tepid.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
It doesn't throw itself into the Jordan Peele-Blumhousian 'social thriller' pattern enough to be designated 'a film about...' Yet its barrage of images are never wild enough to be thought-provoking.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
The Night is a mind-bending and haunting foray into one couple's fractured marriage and the secrets that bind. Unique and frightening, The Night is a trip worth taking.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
[A] sharply well-made dramatic freak-out.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
The Night could easily have been a hokey humdrum horror in less skilled hands, but Ahari's slow pace and deep character work makes for some profoundly emotional horror.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
Ahari uses the hotel's interiors to brilliant, Lynchian effect, playing with the way that liminal spaces create a stage for potentially traumatic transformation.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
While it may not bring anything particularly new to the table, The Night nevertheless effectively assembles well-worn horror elements into a compelling atmosphere of dread.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
Spooky and unsettling, director Kourosh Ahari's eerie suspense yarn The Night got under my skin.
 "
The Night,80,68,critic,"
Some clever twists and stylish visuals elevate the simple concept for viewers willing to overlook the logical gaps and narrative gimmicks.

The Craft: Legacy,49,28,audience,"I have no plan whatsoever to watch this if it's not because I heard good things about the first movie released in 1996(I haven't watch the first one yet while writing this review)but my stupid self just too curious to watch this one, so I going in purely blind about the franchise. First Impression is decent, 10-15 minutes is kind of scrambled and unfortunately everything after that just going downhill, the story became too complicated without cause and too boring with barely any fun. Performance stand point, while some casts is fine the rest just not good and from what I see it's not really the actors fault but more because the script make them to become nothing significant. The music and sound is bad, the visual effect is also bad and in some scenes it's horrendous. The only great thing about this movie: it's make me wanna watch the first movie more than anything right now for doing a comparison."
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,audience,Not worth a watch. This movie tries so hard to be modern and politically correct it loses track of what is supposed to be about. It tries to tackle so many social issues that it feels more like a teen sitcom than a movie about witchcraft. The girls are unlikeable and spend most of the movie shrieking and laughing. 1/5
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,audience,This is more like the idea before the idea without anything complete. From start to finish there’s not much of a start or finish or middle for that matter. 
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,audience,"So, so. Not very original"
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,audience,"This movie was awesome!!  It had its own story line, that was very interesting might I add, that did not have to feed off the original.  I'm a Craft movie lover, and I give it two thumbs up for its own uniqueness!   Loved every bit of it!  Watch it for yourself and see!"
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,audience,"For those who have seen the 90s this movie is a shame in every sense, poor plot, horrible acting, the feminist theme out of place fell into the light and totally lost meaning and form is a shame that David and Michelle with their entire career They appear in such a mediocre film, pessimistic in every way, and whoever does not believe it should see the one from the 90s first and will understand why they failed in every second of the film. total shame waste of money and time"
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,audience,"After maybe the first 30 minutes I kept saying,  ""What is this? What is going on? I'm so confused"" throughout the entire story. I understand it's not supposed to be the same exact plot as the original but it had so much ""wokeness"" in the movie that it was cringy. (Women with an X...really??)  I'm all for inclusivity but you dont have to shove it down our throats. I'm guessing they're making up for the super racist behind-the-scenes stuff of the original but I just think they did too much. 

Way too many plot holes. A lot of the characters were pointless. And many things were brought up but were not touched on enough, bringing up a lot of unanswered questions. This movie was filled with a bunch of fluff and it wasn't really magical.

I do appreciate the wardrobe, the witches were super cute! Haha my favorite part of the movie. Also a lot of people hated the soundtrack but it wasn't that bad... I am a 20 something year old girl so that may explain it lol

IF they make a follow up movie, I really hope they learn from this one and make it way better. For now I'll stick to the original."
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,audience,"This is actually a sequel to the 1996 film ""The Craft"" that starred Neve Campbell and Fairuza Balk .. the later of which has a cameo in the movie.. It has a promising start.. the new cast of girls are pretty good and their stories have potential.. however it gets bogged down in a bit of a messy and unsatisfying conclusion . David Duchovny is in this... and he seems to be collecting a paycheck rather than creating a believable character.. A bit of a misfire despite some decent acting from the leads and some moments that work."
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,audience,"Pure waste of time!  Lack-luster characters. 
Plot is weak, un-original, and predictable to the point of boredom.  None of the magic of the original.  ""Yawn fest"" is being generous.  The best part of the film was the totally un-surprising, super brief cameo of our favorite ""bad witch"".  Do yourself a favor, and skip this one.....even when it's free to watch."
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,audience,Overall this movie was poorly executed with so many lost plot threads and unrealized directions. The universe that was established in the 1996 Craft seems to have been entirely disregarded with the admission of some new information in this movie. This could and should have been much better and failed to carry on the spirit of the original.
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
The Craft: Legacy doesn't hold up under the weight of the cult classic's presence and even the most dedicated of fans will struggle to find any tangible magic here.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
The first half had potential and lost its way completely by the end.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
Clunky pacing aside, everything Lister-Jones throws into the cauldron really works, and it's remarkable how it manages to feel both fresh and nostalgic.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
Good points and bad points to The Craft's Legacy film; ideal for its teen audience, but they deserve better writing too.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
The problems that lie with The Craft: Legacy is that a majority of it feels incomplete.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
With a bright young cast and enough good intentions, this witchy quasi-sequel to the 90s cult classic wins me over.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
This is not a horror movie, and doesn't try to pass itself off as one. There are a handful of mildly creepy moments, but for the most part, Legacy is content to play things pretty safe as a fun teen drama with supernatural elements.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
Though on a skeletal level a rehash of the first film, Legacy is at its best when it is exploring contemporary topics through the lens of its female power fantasy.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
Jones' film gives itself a reason to exist by refining the tone and witchy plotline that's more coherent and gives its coven more of a satisfying dynamic.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
Zoe Lister-Jones pays homage to the 1996 movie with Easter eggs sprinkled throughout however, the story never gets fully fleshed out leaving the audience a little unsatisfied and somewhat confused.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
The message is extremely heavy-handed. For example, after the coven casts a spell of benevolence on the school's most macho bully, he is suddenly more woke than Colin Kaepernick on double espressos.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
Addresses the flaws of the original while also working as a standalone film.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
Nostalgic people will leave the cinema thinking that they have ripped us off under the good name of Blumhouse and that they have destroyed the good name of the original from 96. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
It's energetic, it's endearing, it's delightful. It just isn't what it advertises itself to be: a horror movie.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
A strong young cast with great potential, but the film falls short in the third Act, leaving you not quite satisfied.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
Woke witches in progressive update with language, sexuality.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
The odd millennial update does work, but writer/director Zoe Lister-Jones rushes a toxic masculinity subplot that robs the film of its intended empowerment.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
This 2020 movie attempts to recreate The Craft's magic but surprisingly fails to capture any of the fun, or frights, of the original.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
As a sequel, it gets far more right than it gets wrong and I love that, in spirit, it feels right in line with the original film.
 "
The Craft: Legacy,49,28,critic,"
The movie's biggest flaw is that it never generates any steam until the final act, and even the bad guy is dispatched with relative ease.
 "
Lucky,93,33,audience,"I have no problem with the message of Lucky, it's that when I figured it out in the first 10 minutes, it also became clear that the film wasn't interested in developing anything beyond it. No nuances, no plot developments, only the more obvious things you could do with this idea. That being said it was the script that really let it down, would be interested to see what this director does in the future."
Lucky,93,33,audience,"I understand that it's important to make films about women by women empowering women but Lucky just isn't it. The movie is confusing, messy, senseless and completely unenjoyable. What ever made it interesting in the first five minutes quickly fades when events keep popping up without any explanation. I would've liked to see this premise with a better execution because I'm sure it would've been great."
Lucky,93,33,audience,"The premise itself is interesting and fairly unique but it ultimately ends up being quite boring, disjointed and just kind of weird (not in a good way either). Brea does as good of a job as she can, but the writing is a little iffy in places. You can pretty much figure out the metaphor within the first 30 minutes or so but then it just continues to drag on and on despite it's short runtime. Without trying to spoil anything here, the scenes where the killer appears are overly choreographed to a point where he does not look threatening in the slightest. You never feel any worry for the main character as the killer is basically a walking bunching bag with no offense. Towards the end, the atmosphere gets a little cool as things start to get really wacky. But then you start to wonder what's real and what's not but not in an interesting psychological horror thriller way, but more of a what's just a visual metaphor and what is really happening around her? Things start to fall apart and not make sense and most of the characters make idiotic choices and act very irrational and unrealistic (minor spoiler: why does it take like 5 consecutive nights of attacks for a cop to finally hang out for the night but still ends up being useless). Overall, this movie is just not good and one I was begging to end as fast as possibly. I truly wanted to turn it off half way through but battled on just to see how it wraps up even though it turned out to be exactly what I thought. Nothing against the metaphor or meaning either, I understand it's importance in society, but my girlfriend who watched with me was equally let down by this movie and hated it more than me. A lot of plot holes too or just unneeded additions to the story. I would not recommend this movie."
Lucky,93,33,audience,"A modern day feminist's metaphoric, narrow perspective of a dark misogynistic and patriarchal reality. While I found the movie somewhat misandristic, it was peculiar and fairly suspenseful until it wasn't."
Lucky,93,33,audience,Excellent feminist horror film.
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Grant's aching heart spills out a story of blood and boldness, dread and defiance.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Observant and clever slasher/fable hybrid about unrelenting harassment and dismissal that women so often face. But is it horror? Oh yes.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Technically it is a good film in that it is shot well, the story is not predictable and acting is generally well done.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Lucky is an ambitious horror film that has a message it wants the world to see. Unfortunately, not everything lands as well as it should.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
A powerfully political and highly entertaining slasher that will have its audience going over its themes and ideas long after the credits roll.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Its ambiguous journey will have audiences split, for sure, but it kept me on my toes.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
It's not quite on the level of Promising Young Woman, but it serves up a similar hornet's nest of provoking larger questions in the sheep's clothing of ersatz horror-ish trash.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
A sharply-written horror picture that provides the requisite jolts while also giving you something to think about.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Grant's powerful yet understated performance, which also incorporates some intense physical combat, and Kermani's sure-handed direction, which steadily builds suspense and tension... spiral into total weirdness.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
At only eighty minutes, it doesn't outstay its welcome and if you're looking for a more cerebral horror than usual, this should be right up your street.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
They say hell is other people, but in Natasha Kermani's Lucky, the reality is much more daunting.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
As the filmmakers dial in tighter on those keen observations, their movie gets more and more chilling.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Lucky makes absolutely the right choice by having Grant taking the lead in her own script.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
I appreciate it, and I respect it for what it is.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Grant delivers a strong and sympathetic performance as May, and if her script is flawed, at least its flaws are borne out of ambition instead of laziness.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Home invasion horror films are a dime a dozen and it's difficult to keep this kind of horror film fresh but Brea Grant who stars as May and wrote the screenplay has found a way.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Anchored by a strong performance by writer-star Brea Grant, Lucky's infinite horrors deliver a timely commentary and plenty of blood.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Lucky is a new ""loop"" thriller offering a fresh and personal approach to the premise. It may get a bit sappy with it's eventual message, but one can't help but grasp the universal themes it offers.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Yet another refreshing twist on the time-loop tale, Lucky is an effective empowerment fable, one which works both as a conversation starter, and an enjoyable slice of home-invasion horror.
 "
Lucky,93,33,critic,"
Compact and efficient, Lucky puts a fun spin on the repeating timeline narrative.
 "
The Mortuary Collection,95,75,audience,"This is probably more like 3.5 stars but I'm giving it 4 because it gave me one of the biggest laughs I've had in ages. It's been a long time since I've seen a good anthology film; it brings me back to the 80s, which clearly was their intent, as the whole thing has a Creepshow-like vibe to it. The difference is, these stories try to put a spin on some classic horror tropes. I can't say any of them were scary, but they were fun and creepy and pretty clever. It's got a B-movie, made-for-cable feel to it, but the effects and production values are surprisingly good considering I'm guessing this didn't have a huge budget. Recommended for anyone who likes the genre or anyone looking for something a bit different. Oh, and the 2nd story about the frat boy had me crying laughing during the birth scene. That story had some smart social commentary but it's done in a way that doesn't feel forced or heavy handed, it's just a really devious spin on story we've all seen play out too many times, but this time the tables are turned. Even the twist in the last story, which didn't totally work, I didn't see coming. All in all I was pretty impressed and glad I watched it."
The Mortuary Collection,95,75,audience,Just a brilliant nod to the genre and good filmmaking to boot...
The Mortuary Collection,95,75,audience,"The critic consensus says that this flick manages to maintain a consistent tone. But I don't think so. The main problem with this movie is that it's inconsistent, it's uneven, some parts are better than others. I found that some parts really lack substance. But otherwise, The Mortuary Collection is not a horrible movie, it's probably one of the better horror anthologies to come out in recent years. The acting is decent, Clancy Brown gives a memorable performance as a ghoulish mortician. It's got a few scares here and there, and doesn't mind being quite enjoyably gory from time to time. The cinematography is quite polished, I liked that. Overall, The Mortuary Collection is a novel horror effort, but unfortunately sometimes it falls short. But overall, this is recommended for horror fans!"
The Mortuary Collection,95,75,audience,"This movie made me laugh out loud several times and yet, it was also disturbing for a horror film junkie."

 "
The Mortuary Collection,95,75,critic,"
If you do find yourself entertained by short films filled with blood, guts, creatures, and morality tales-don't forget the morality tales-then you will undoubtedly love The Mortuary Collection as much as I did.
 "
The Mortuary Collection,95,75,critic,"
For fans of a bit of tongue in cheek horror with buckets of blood, gore and... um, well other bodily fluids, then The Mortuary Collection may just be what you're looking for.

Relic,92,49,audience,"Relic 2020 sets it apart from a family of commercial, purely and cheaply entertaining movies which only serve to make profits out of audience and makes it a special and valuable black sheep recently. Relic is one of the latest films revitalising the beauty and power of slow-burn horror movies such as The Babadook or Midsommar. As the movie underscores the usage of fear and horror as tools for provoking deeper layer of lessons and meanings, it embraces a slow pace and an indetermine shape of the mysterious evil. This causes a bewilderment and curiosity of viewers to focus on the film and further the uncertainty of the question ""Is it the supernatural power or the disease that makes Edna like that?"". The metaphor can be a little too heavily handed but it holds an integral role in making the film unique with the requirement of literature knowledge and film techniques. All of these factors constitute a gloomy vibe and atmosphere lacking in vitality and energy of different objects. To wrap it up, Relic like other movies of same genre is not frightening in images or sound but more a psychological family movie."
Relic,92,49,audience,"The worst and stupidest horror movie I have ever seen in my whole life. For 80 minutes it just dragged on without any progress. I almost fell asleep. Worse, they must have said 'Mom?' 82 times; 'Gran?' 37 times; 'Sam?' 18 times. At the end after Gran went totally berserk and tried to murder them, then overwhelmed, instead of leaving the house ASAP they just stayed in. Does the director think the audience are fools?"
Relic,92,49,audience,"This is a gripping, cerebral psychological thriller/horror that builds methodically, with great character development and scene-setting. It takes its time exposing its core, and I'm sure this will have turned people off, but it's worth the wait. An unusual topic for a horror, and one that I've never seen presented in such a way, it will stay with me for some time"
Relic,92,49,audience,"In a lonely old house way out in the country, the middle of nowhere, three women (representing the three stages of women?) get together to sort things out...only the unseen fourth member of the group rattles around menacingly behind the walls and out of sight. Should we fear whoever it is...or what? An interesting presentation of a primordial reality."
Relic,92,49,audience,"Slow-burning tension is stacked to create an involving, atmospheric and economical thriller aided by horror elements."
Relic,92,49,audience,This movie is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
Relic,92,49,audience,"Disconcerting at first, unhelped by a slow burn approach, the movie reveals its true creepy nature in a clever build up. The acting trio is at the top of their game. Spooky and unsettling, the third act is masterful in building tension through creepiness and strong visual ideas. For a feature debut it's a bold but assured move."
Relic,92,49,audience,"Nothing has a point, they show you lost of stuff, lots of events, but they are all for no reason, nothing is explained, nothing makes sense, this movie was awfull."
Relic,92,49,audience,"Nice cinematography and actresses, but I found it very boring, and a bit pointless."
Relic,92,49,audience,THIS MOVIES IS SO FUCKING TRASH YOU SHOULD NEVER WATCH THIS IN YOUR LIFE
Relic,92,49,critic,"
[A] masterful debut. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
Relic positions three generations of women as a triptych, more a study of one woman at different points in time interacting with herself than three separate characters.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
It's a tense fright that will leave you aghast if you're willing to let it.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
""Relic"" is the feel-dread movie of the year.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
Natalie Erika James' debut doesn't just tug at the heart, Relic wraps around it and steadily sinks its teeth into it.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
This is an unsettling, intimate approach to the horror of aging ... and of dying.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
The debut feature from writer-director Natalie Erika James functions as both an allegory and a nightmarish descent into this year's creepiest movie home.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
Relic dials into creeping terror within the home. It doesn't really do anything new with the material, but it often manages to work.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
A film both simple and complex, with layers of feelings.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
...aiming for the kind of generational distrust that fuelled Hereditary...
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
A horror film that takes place in the dark recesses of a fracturing mind, Relic is an all-too-real examination of mortality, the ones we leave behind, and the ones we let go.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
James is not just interested in scaring you with RELIC. She wants viewers to just feel something so deeply, whether that is fear, sadness, or even both.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
It is not just about Edna, but about the relationships between these three women and grief, anger, and acceptance manifest between them.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
A powerful allegory for the anguish of dementia and the fears that surround it.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
A beautifully disturbing and atmospheric film that has a lot to say, but says it a little too quickly and rather too loudly for its lessons to truly linger.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
I am not a big fan of horror films, but this one is not bad. It is a bit too slow-moving for my taste, but there is plenty of suspense and emotion to give it some zing, nonetheless.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
When it feels like every type of horror has been done, something like Relic is a breath of fresh air
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
Meaningful storytelling that's a bit heavy-handed with the metaphors.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
Natalie Erika James' debut feature chills, terrifies and saddens, painting an all-too-real portrait of the horrors of losing a parent to dementia.
 "
Relic,92,49,critic,"
Director and co-writer Natalie Erika James keeps it a slow-burn with the family's relationship dynamics playing a major role in building up the narrative.

Force of Nature,9,18,audience,Despite what the reviews say Forces of Nature isn't really that bad. The story is absurd but loads of fun to watch and it's all just entertainment in the end. I was bored and wanted to watch something cool and this movie is just that.
Force of Nature,9,18,audience,Great movie to watch with your friends and family.
Force of Nature,9,18,audience,"A terrible and ridiculously lame misfire with Mel Gibson being the only decent thing about the film, but he unfortunately couldn't save the movie."
Force of Nature,9,18,audience,This is a good B movie.  Don't pay attention to all the harsh critics.
Force of Nature,9,18,audience,"You know how some movies are so bad, they're actually fun to watch?  This isn't one of them.  Right from the opening aerial shots of San Juan, you know this is going to be a bumpy journey into B-Movie territory.  The best actor in the movie is the hurricane, and she destroys everything she touches.  I'm not sure why Mel Gibson agreed to be in this, but even his charismatic, old-school presence can't rescue this absurd attempt at drama.  Give this one a pass, it's 90 minutes you'll never get back."
Force of Nature,9,18,audience,Challenge: write a cop thriller around the most bizarre elements you can... Winner: Force of Nature.  Tropical Storm.  Puerto Rico.  100 lbs of meat.  Hidden multimillion dollar paintings in a beach condo.  Bonus points: Get A list actors to sign up for your film.
Force of Nature,9,18,audience,"Don't be put off OR on by the trailer because it is a very poor representation of the bigger film.  Sure, the bones of the trailer are accurate but it does nothing to portray the somewhat hilarious tone of the film.  It feels more like an oddball cop show in the rain than the somewhat grandiose natural disaster themed flick I was expecting.  Once they get to the apartment building that's under siege, it's all crazy running between different rooms for no really good reason.  There is a force of nature kept behind a big locked door, and it's not a hurricane.  Truth be told I've seen the whole film and I'm still not crystal clear what it was."
Force of Nature,9,18,audience,Mel Gibson deserves less bad reviews of this movie
Force of Nature,9,18,audience,"Overall, if you enjoy a brainless action film which involves bad guys making a robbery during a hurricane storm (yes, like The Hurricane Heist), then this film is certainly one for you. But the real mess is not the storm; it is many elements including unlikeable characters, unusual filming style and questionable colour correction, which make some moments seem far too bright. The plot is messy when it should be rather simple. While it is pleasing to see actor, Mel Gibson make a solid appearance rather than a brief cameo; his presence doesn't bring something fresh. The film's third act is also incredibly cringe-worthy, and by this point I truly begged for the film to be over. Another disappointing film for 2020, which I truly did not expect given the cast and the film's concept.  - Walkden Entertainment"
Force of Nature,9,18,audience,I have been waiting for a Mel Gibson movie where he  kick**s he definitely delivers till his death and the bad guy take down was unique. Movies like this So needed at this time!
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Some movies are born bad; some achieve badness through lack of care or budget. Some seem to aspire to it and Michael Polish has had a long enough career to know the difference.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
It never hides the fact that it's a very silly film
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
It's no more consciously racist than a hundred action thrillers from the '80s. It's meant, I think, to be a throwback to those films, and to an era where Mel Gibson was still on top, but it lacks the snap and pizzazz to close the deal.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Force of Nature is supposed to take place during a hurricane, but the movie itself is another kind of disaster.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Works best when Gibson is onscreen to rain belligerence on all comers but gradually disintegrates in its last act.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
The material's exploitation of a fictional Puerto Rican hurricane for cheap and contrived white-savior thrills pushes it into the realm of ugliness.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
It almost feels as if director Michael Polish and screenwriter Cory M. Miller are trying to transform the material into self-parody.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Lacking an original bone and creative craftsmanship, The Force of Nature goes through the motions in its tasteless embrace of dated genre conventions.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
It's predictable, unambitious, and at times absurd, but it has solid performances, well-executed suspense sequences, and a premise with potential. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
""Force of Nature"" plays by the timeless rules of pulp fiction, and only when the eye of the hurricane passes over and an eerie, tense calm takes hold does the movie strike a note of originality.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
A subpar B movie without silver linings.[Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Generic, boring and predictable. One of the year's worse so far. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Just your average action thriller. Nothing to write home about but it does have Mel Gibson in a supporting role and that's a surprise.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
At best, Force of Nature is a cheap approximation of better movies. At worst, it's a toxic blend of racist and misogynistic cliches that feel especially painful during this moment in time.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Hollering in a Noo Yawk accent even more outsized than his prosthetic pot belly, Gibson's emphysematic, pistol-packin' Archie Bunker is by far the best thing about the film.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Force of Nature is the most imminently skippable movie of 2020.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
The equivalent of three cheesy action flicks for the price of one, this waterlogged crime thriller never generates its intended suspense.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Make no mistake that this is a very dumb action movie.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Force of Nature is more of a nasty little rainstorm than a Category 5 anything.
 "
Force of Nature,9,18,critic,"
Regrettably, and predictably, Force of Nature isn't interestingly bad - it's just bad.
 "
Z,97,53,audience,Painful to watch.  The storyline starts out ridiculous and just gets worse.  Save your time and watch something else.
Z,97,53,audience,Loved this movie. Jett Klyne and Keegan Connor Tracy are great!
Z,97,53,audience,"very nice, especially the fact that the creature is seen a few times. the Jumpscare were well calculated, the scene when Z comes out of the wall to attack the protagonist's husband is spectacular. Interesting how Z manages to somehow interact with the outside world. I recommend it to everyone who has seen babadook and similar movies."
Z,97,53,audience,"Weak CGI, worst script and nonsense. At leat there are good actors."
Z,97,53,audience,A good starting idea but overall disapointing.

Z,97,53,audience,"A young couple begin to become concerned with the behaviour of their son after he starts to have an imaginary friend named Z. 
This was pretty good.  Nothing overly new or groundbreaking but the story is told well and believably performed.  A nice little surprise of a horror movie."
Z,97,53,audience,Very engrossing and well paced!
Z,97,53,critic,"
What this film does accomplish is a new take on old scares.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
Although a familiar premise, Christensen directs a film that is full of chilly and creepy surprises. It also incorporate the clever special effects. These effects work really well in introducing us to the menacing Z.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
...a slow-burn horror flick that benefits substantially from its top-notch performances and perpetually stylish visuals...
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
There are a lot of pointless clichés and easy jumpscares in Z, but at the end Brandon Christensen manages to make an intelligent little horror film about trauma and normality. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
The lasting effect of the film is in its allegory of how mental illness attaches itself to us, to the point we sometimes find comfort in it.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
Marred by a few gaps in character logic and behavior, this ""imaginary friend"" horror movie is nonetheless quite spooky thanks to its clever camera setups, sharp sense of timing, and startling music.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
Takes more than a few unexpected plot turns.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
A genuinely scary ""imaginary friend"" film.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
Everyone says it's normal for a kid to have an imaginary friend, but what this rather impressive horror flick asks is ""what if they shouldn't?""
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
Z is a small film that transcends the limits of its budget. It's proof that good, old-fashioned story-telling is always more effective than millions of dollars worth of CG explosions.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
Z is a film that will have you shrieking in spooky delight one second, and planting a cold ball of anxiety in your gut the next. Legitimately terrifying and a really excellent study in trauma...
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
The plot swerves are too dependent on carefully concealed backstory, and the otherwise deliciously surreal third act accordingly feels somewhat unearned.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
Z provides effective scares and at least one moment that made this parent scream in horror. It's doing so many of the right things, but like a puzzle with a few pieces missing, it's hard to see the full picture.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
Its main goal is to scare the crap out of you. And, reader: It probably will.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
There are many levels of horror present in Z, as it attacks audiences physically, mentally, and emotionally.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
A fascinating entry into the world of 'evil imaginary friends'. Canadian cinema once again proves that its content is worthy of mainstream consideration. [Full review in Spanish].
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
It's clear Christensen has no shortage of ways to pervade parenthood with chills, perhaps even more so than infiltrating childhood with terror.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
An unnerving exploration into some very dark areas, with the added bonus of having some truly terrifying and shocking moments, Z is a film that will stick with you long after the credits roll.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
Christensen captures the bland menace of seemingly placid suburbia, where the wholesome nuclear family hides dark secrets.
 "
Z,97,53,critic,"
Extraordinarily unnerving and featuring exceptional, thought-provoking writing and standout performances from Keegan Connor Tracy and Jett Klyne, Z is guaranteed to get inside your head and haunt you for days.

Rock Camp: The Movie,93,90,audience,"What a fun ride. Wish I played an instrument - to have an opportunity to play with some of these giants. So fantastic seeing these amazing musicians working with the ‘fans' in such a fun, and respectful way. It was not only a fantasy camp for everyday musicians, but you can tell the rock stars had just as much fun. Everyone talked the same musical language - music, and it was inspiring. Worth the watch. And if you sing or play, I would consider putting the Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp on your bucket list. What a great tribute – and hats off - to David Fishof, the innovator, and all around music aficionado - who put these wonder events together."
Rock Camp: The Movie,93,90,audience,"After 40 years a Roadie, my expectations for this film were extremely high! It was going to have to be really good for me to have to justify paying to watch the people I work with?
Boy, was I wrong, this documentary style film captures the truth and heartfelt journeys of some extremely amazing campers! The Rock Stars meet and play with ""regular"" folks whose dream is to perform with their idols.
Grab a box of tissues as this movie will hit you emotionally while also making you laugh a lot!
It is an amazing movie to watch alone, with family or even for date night.

Get a bowl of popcorn ready and settle in, you will be transfixed for the duration of the film.

David Fishof has created a musical wonderland in the camps. This film captures its spirit 125%.

ENJOY, I did.
Much Love & Respect"
Rock Camp: The Movie,93,90,audience,"Wow!  This film is a great peek into what is obviously a great, and sometimes life-changing experience.

The talking heads include Roger Daltry, Alice Cooper, Gene Simmons, Sammy Hagar and Joe Perry, all of whom seem to be having fun...just like viewers of this movie.
 "
Rock Camp: The Movie,93,90,critic,"
Even though the film is a hodgepodge interspersing music with sage advice and realism about being a rock star, you get to go behind the scenes, seeing the famous at your level as if you went to camp yourself. Play on!
 "
Rock Camp: The Movie,93,90,critic,"
I always appreciate examples of kids and teens being mentored in films, and this one is great! The rock royalty includes--Roger Daultry, Joe Perry, Slash, Clarence Clemons, Meat Loaf, and Joe Walsh, along with Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, of Kiss.

It's inspiring and occasionally touching to hear about amateurs living out their rock 'n' roll fantasies with Roger Daltrey, Alice Cooper and the like.

There's nothing particularly exceptional about the filmmaking on display in Rock Camp...But then, that's not the point.

Rock Camp will be worthwhile for fans of the rockers involved who like a feel-good watch, but it doesn't hold up beyond that.

We could all use a good pick-me-up, and Rock Camp: The Movie fulfills that role.

We Can Be Heroes,73,43,audience,Fun family movie.  My kids (age 9 and 10) have watched multiple times.
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,audience,It wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen. Definitely a kids movie and hardly even related to sharkboy and lava girl. But there were a few genuinely funny moments and cool ideas. Good for kids.
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,audience,"You can be a hero too kids. All you gotta do is follow Pedro and tattle tale on everyone that makes you mad. Then, you can take their job and thats what we superheros in hollywood do ! Come! Learn how to be hero!"
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,audience,"I dont like when an adult gives up and convinces an impressionable young mind to put in the work that the adult should have done. I don't like that this taints the child's perception of life causing them to fail at the work because it's too big to handle, and therefore they become the same adults that have come up before them. These are adults who are too lazy and unbothered with life to seek a better community and future. But instead of admitting to their lackadaisical attitude towards the world around them, they preach a message that the next generation will be better than the last, while in action they are actually passing the buck and making thier own sins into the burdens of their kids. But the new generation will keep the same selfish attitude as the older generation, not fixing anything while preaching at the rest of the world to be better.

The movie can be summed up with a character quote: ""The next generation is always more powerful. More evolved.""

The movie makes it a point to drill in this message that the next generation is inheriting the older generation's errors and will do better to fix its impending doom (though no one in real life ever has an answer on what they'll do different nor what their parents' generation did wrong). In fact, experience shows that active parents make active kids, co.passionate parents make compassionate kids, combative parents make combative kids, lazy parents make lazy kids.

It also promotes stealing the presidential election (by a bumbling older man who can't put two sentences together) in order to pass power over to the next generation. The most essential characters are all female, from Grandma Moreno to Lady Granada to natural-born leader Missy, to annoyingly powerful singer A Capella. Because the future is female. This is the second movie I've now seen with Priyanka Jonas that justifies criminal behavior against the supposedly privileged (White Tiger is the other film).

Both films throw in just enough truth and flowery inspiration to make you believe they care about the same things you do while promoting aggression against differing thought. They paint the foul world as black-and-white.

Watch this WITH your kids or WITHOUT but let them watch without you. Talk to them about true teamwork. About older and newer generations entering the future together. About boys and girls being leaders with different qualities. About having discussions on how to address concerns instead of painting a black and white picture of outdated generations. Heroes work together and are not judgmentally divisive in the name of young fads. By the film's end, there was no actual threat to the heroes/kids. The heroes and the leaders manufactured a threat so the new generation would react. They destroyed parts of their own city so the kids would react. Watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong."
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,audience,A movies that I can watch for days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥 Best movie ever 👌😍
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,audience,"When I heard there was going to be a follow up with Shark Boy and Lava Girl, I was so excited even though Taylor Lautner wasn't going to reprise his role. When I saw this movie, I was extremely disappointed. It was cringey, corny, and just bad. I would have been better if they didn't even make this movie."
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,audience,this movie was the best 2021  movie i ever seen on netflix like fr it was the best guys and my farvorite character was YaYa gossenlin beacause the way she leaded her team was pretty cool tho i could say that for sure i love u guys and the movie u guys filmed for a team as a kid u guys rocked hehe i love tall movie guys and great leadership skills and is great at directing her team of Heroics. She is also shown to be smart.
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,audience,"This movie gives children's movies and bad name. Superheroe plots are always about:
1. Tragedy
2. Denial of being a hero
3. Believing in yourself
4. Defeating the villain
I feel that I was robbed of 4 and it then made the entire movie make no sense at the end."

Rodriguez' superhero-kid adventure has action, humor.
 "

We Can Be Heroes is one of Rodriguez's strongest entries in his eclectic career. That might sound a little silly, but the film is packed full of imagination and is genuinely accessible to a vast number of people of all ages.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
""Heroes"" is colorful and garish and relentlessly energized; as such, it's not designed to work for anyone who wouldn't be permitted into a PG-13 movie without a guardian.
 "

While the twisty plot is plainly ridiculous, it's also a lot of fun, even when liberally dishing out messages about empowerment and teamwork.
 "

I didn't get a migraine, but there are stronger recommendations.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
We need a baby-sitter we can trust while nursing the last of the season's hangovers. Just try and stay out of the room for the excruciatingly sunny cover of David Bowie's Heroes.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
To call this low hanging fruit would sound like an insult, but really, Robert Rodriguez making a goofy superhero movie for kids feels like a welcome respite in this hellish year.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
We Can Be Heroes acts as an endearing roll-call for its target audience.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
A sort of sequel to ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl,"" this film gives kids exactly what they want. Adults? Not so much.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
Totally hokey, with a 1970s Saturday morning vibe; a serviceable entertainment for the wee crowd, but likely a one-off watch.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
While the film's theme is extremely upfront, it meets children where they are and aims to empower them. We Can Be Heroes is a heartfelt letter about the future that aims to be inspiring.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
Rodriguez's film has a simple nobility to it that does a lot to overcome the slapdash CGI and cheap sets. It's always easier to embrace something when it's made with sincerity and heart.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
We Can Be Heroes is a cheerful and colorful take on the superhero genre with a powerful message about empowering younger generations to take the reins and do better than their parents.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
This was clearly made for kids, not critics, and the design and action are vibrant enough to divert them. Rodriguez is well-versed in superhero tropes for parents who can appreciate comic-book satire.
 "
We Can Be Heroes,73,43,critic,"
The get-a-load-of-this facetiousness of ""We Can Be Heroes"" feels a bit rote, like the child-lite version of a ""Men in Black"" escapade crossed with wisps of nostalgia for ""The Goonies.""
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
I believe. And you will, too, after seeing Dana Nachman's newest uplifting documentary ""Dear Santa.""
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
As the viewer, you'll experience the joy of the Christmas spirit. You can't help be inspired by Santa's elves and the trouble they encounter in finding the kids' perfect gifts.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
Dear Santa delivers a dose of serotonin that might just put you in the Christmas spirit after all.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
Only the most cold-hearted people won't feel any emotions from watching Dear Santa. The movie will also make people think about how much they can give back to their communities -- not just during the end-of-year holidays but throughout the entire year.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
...so inspiring a film that it may help you think better of the United States Postal Service...
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
... if you've forgotten where you put your jolly, pop open a carton of eggnog and stream this uneven, yet charming documentary.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
Wholesome and heartwarming film.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
Nachman's work here is glorious, joy-filled, and celebratory of the human spirit.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
It's hard to imagine a time when audiences were more in need of absolutely shameless treacle, but anyone who brings those hopes into ""Dear Santa"" will find them returned to sender.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
Overall, nice is nice and it's empowering, but there's nothing really new under this tree.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
This is truly life-affirming and uplifting, a reminder that there can be real kindness in the world.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
It will restore your faith in human nature and it's one of the best documentaries of the year.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
Sweet seasonal docu about USPS' holiday-giving campaign.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
Dear Santa is reminder of the usefulness of empathy and the power of collective action.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
Dear Santa shows that Christmas is not just for children, but for the communities and the heart.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
I probably love it as much for the fact that we need something like this right now.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
By turns funny, tender, and just so sweet and endearing.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
Merry Christmas definitely comes easy and early in all the right places here.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
You'd have to be a real Scrooge not to feel some holiday cheer while watching this breezy documentary.
 "
Dear Santa,92,,critic,"
Filmmaker Dana Nachman, who makes uplifting, kid-friendly documentaries like 'Batkid Begins' and 'Pick of the Litter,' returns with this holiday delight, sure to inspire smiles and reaches for the tissue box.

Superintelligence,31,31,audience,Haven't laughed this hard since ages
Superintelligence,31,31,audience,Annoyingly bad especially with such a talented cast. McCarthy should really stop doing projects with her husband
Superintelligence,31,31,audience,Ha ha so funny man i love it
Superintelligence,31,31,audience,"Had the cinema to ourselves over summer hols not a hot day though. Had some good satirical moments, but also some cringeworthy Americanisms."
Superintelligence,31,31,audience,Excellent funny film
Superintelligence,31,31,audience,"Enjoyable. Very funny in parts. Melissa McCarthy is her usual fabulous self. The overall plot has you thinking about the weird, and potentially dangerous, possibilities of Artificial Intelligence and the state of the world."
Superintelligence,31,31,audience,"Loved it! Well casted, funny, romantic, and just a feel good movie!"
Superintelligence,31,31,audience,"Melissa please stop doing movies with your Husband!!!! You are far too talented. No offense to your husband as a person but he is a mediocre to sub par movie maker and you are one of the premier comedic talents in the country. Make movies with great writers, directors, comedic geniuses. I appreciate the loyalty to family but let your husband go make c level, d level movies or let him find a new career. If you not making movies with him hurts his feelings he needs to go see a therapist to work on his fragile ego. Your audience and fans beg you to not waste your talent making movies where he has creative control. Spy, Bridesmaids, The Heat were your three best films. Go back to making comedies of this caliber. "
Superintelligence,31,31,audience,Too cheesy for me! Love Melissa but maybe watch with tweens and young adults...
Superintelligence,31,31,audience,"Good for families, but it was a BIT cheesy."
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
Misguided and a missed opportunity.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
For the record, I don't think the people behind Superintelligence are bad, I just wish their judgment had been a bit more super.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
Shot through with an appealing sweetness, the film leans heavily on McCarthy's charm, comedic chops and ability to deliver nuanced emotion. Fortunately, she's more than capable of delivering.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
There is both an unexpected sweetness and relaxed energy in play here that realises the movie's limited ambitions with ease.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
It's a massive moral wrapped in founts of fun.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
A half-baked, scattered mess that gives up on itself almost as quickly as the audience does.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
McCarthy is hysterical as always; the film has a sweet ending with thoughts of hope for our human nature.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
I'll admit, I was rooting for armageddon...
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
Superintelligence isn't very smart
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
Rarely funny and completely nonsensical - the plot is an absolute mess - Superintelligence wastes genuine talent on an absolute non-event of a movie
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
As per usual in McCarthy's growing resume of passable mainstream vehicles, her talent is mostly wasted. It's stuff like this that makes me want to shake her and scream, ""stop doing this to your career!""
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
Superintelligence is as daft as a brush, dafter perhaps, but it's so darn nice it's hard not to like.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
Melissa McCarthy is such a wonderful actor that it remains a shame that she keeps doing humorless and desperate movies like this.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
It's frustrating when a film begins with a promise and then settles on doing the same old, same old.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
If nothing else, it takes real guts to unironically name your fairly stupid comedy 'Superintelligence.'
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
Ultimately, Superintelligence is neither super nor intelligent, but in all fairness, Middlingdimwittedness would be a terrible title.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
Yet another bust from McCarthy and Falcone. McCarthy pops doing what she does best every now and then, but it's just not enough to support an unfunny AI romance that doesn't seem to understand how technology works.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
McCarthy fans will like AI comedy with pratfalls, kissing.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
McCarthy has the movie if not completely to herself, then nearly so. Even though the innocuous Superintelligence is on the bland side, it remains hard not to enjoy two hours with McCarthy.
 "
Superintelligence,31,31,critic,"
Though nominally a sci-fi comedy, Superintelligence gives viewers almost nothing to look at beyond its appealing actors, often shot in soft focus.

Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,audience,"A Christmas musical film starring the legend Dolly Parton with original songs written by her. It is a simple story in which an embittered woman plans to sell her small town, regardless of the consequences to the people who live there. A bit of a cliché and perhaps without the songs or without Dolly Parton, it would have been a terrible movie, but it has great choreographies and it's a humble project that is full of Christmas spirit and joy."
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,audience,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was so excited. Dolly Parton, Christine Baranski, and Jennifer Lewis in the same musical movie? I was expecting a Broadway-worthy performance, but was sorely disappointed by what I got.

Despite the sheer talent of the actors in this movie as well as the seemingly decent production budget, this movie is all style with zero substance. The plot is nonsensical. The movie either expects the audience to be so dumb as to be emotionally manipulated by the banal goings-on in this movie or the producers really thought there was no need to make a competent story.

I also have to ding Dolly a little who (reportedly) did the music and lyrics for this musical. The couple of songs that she sings solo are fantastic and could easily be taken out of this movie and put on an album. But the lyrics of the other songs are just awful with the laziest rhymes I've heard in a musical in a long while. The music is good and you can tell it's very ""musical-y"" tunes, but again, all style with no substance.

Overall, this is just a huge disappointment. This movie is a great example how all of the talented actors in the world cannot make a terrible script into a good movie."
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,audience,"It made me cringe, smile, cry and sing-along. Good enough to make me feel like it was Christmas, but definitely not the best"
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,audience,Dolly Parton is a genius and everything she touches is golden. This is an instant classic that has everything you could want in a Christmas movie. I loved it
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,audience,so heartwarming! loved watching this on christmas eve.
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,audience,"it' Christmas, time for sappy, i love sappy and with Dolly that would be enough but this goes past that. Amazing talent show cased in song and dance, oh what dancing.  going on our ""watch every year"" list for sure. 
i gotta say, reading some of the reviews,,, there are a lot of Scrooges writing them, hope they get visited by a Christmas Angel.  i often wonder if critics really get why we love movies???"
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,audience,"I think somebody should have caught the obvious factual mistake before releasing this movie.  Christine Baranski's character has flashbacks at the end, of herself(white) as a teenager meeting a boy(also white) at a dance, then explains how she hooked up with him and became pregnant.  She explains her father made her give that baby up for adoption.  She finds out that the pastor of this town she is trying to sell is the baby she gave up when she was a teenager.  The problem...the pastor is dark-skinned and Puerto Rican.  It's physiologically impossible for two white people to have intercourse and produce a dark-skinned Puerto Rican baby."
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,audience,"I love, love, LOVE Dolly Parton. She is a loving, empathetic, compassionate, and generous person beyond comparison. Her intentions are always pure. But this movie is filled with every over-the-top cliche and stereotype known to humankind, and it's rather painful and ""cringey"" to watch. It could be one of those movies famed for being so bad, that you just have to watch it. I won't badmouth Dolly though. Her good in the world outweighs this silly movie. Watch it anyway. It's Dolly."
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,audience,"An escapist holiday treat featuring well crafted songs by the ebullient Dolly Parton, who also stars as an angel. Her job is to dissuade a Scrooge-like businesswoman, played by Christine Baranski, from evicting everyone in her old hometown in order to sell it to a huge mall. Debbie Allen's deft direction and choreography help bring this lighthearted tale to life. Campy and corny? Most definitely! But at the end of 2020, I ate it up."
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,audience,"One star because i love me some Dolly...
Half star because i really love me some Dolly...
However, some movies are so bad they are good...not this movie.
This movie made me angry and it murdered my eyes and ear holes and soul.
Yes, it is that bad. 
I still love you Dolly...like really love you! xo"

It's hard to figure out quite where Christmas on the Square is headed in any given moment, despite the film borrowing liberally from festive classics.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
Holiday musical includes mature themes, promotes faith.

Old-fashioned to a fault... but hey, it's almost Christmas.

Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
While the limits of the budget may be visible, it's a quaint little project with a big heart.

A beautiful movie with messages of love and forgiveness. The music and Dolly Parton will warm your heart.

Flooded with clichés yet never knowingly predictable, it's certainly unlike anything else you'll see this festive season, a rollercoaster ride ricocheting towards sentiments of goodwill.

Deck the halls with joys of Dolly in this musically entertaining family treat.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
To be sure, there will be Scrooges who poo-poo the simplistic nature of Square, yet it's the sort of movie we need right now. With so much enmity in the air, a refresher on the power of faith, hope and charity is needed.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
While Christmas on the Square is average, the singer's influence over the story is the grabber.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
In many ways, the film is fairly insufferable -- the story drags in so many elements designed to tug at the heartstrings... [But] Christmas in the Square still has a couple of assets that even the biggest of churls would be hard-pressed to deny.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
Holiday ""classic"" it may not be, but Dolly always has been and deserves our thanks and attention accordingly.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
Overall, the story is lackluster, production low quality, and performance fell flat.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
I was expecting at least some weird dumb fun, but there's barely any of that in here, apart from Baranski singing, ""Gotta get out of this town"" like an emo teen in a coming-of-age indie movie.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
Part cheesy Hallmark movie, part community-theater production, part A Christmas Carol meets It's a Wonderful Life, the special is a mosaic of holiday tropes - and that's a good thing.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square most likely won't be added into your yearly rotation of Christmas movies, but it may just put a smile on your face as your decorate the tree.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
""Campy"" is camp with a diploma and a martini. And ""Christmas on the Square"" is a drunk.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
Not even our love for the queen of country herself is deep enough to redeem Christmas on the Square, an abomination of a holiday film that is devoid of all charm and originality.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
Even when Parton is playing a character whose one-dimensional goodness would make you groan and roll your eyes if another actress were playing the part, she seems to actually believe her own words.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
If you come to Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square hoping to get exactly what you want from your favorite performers and some ol' fashioned musical magic from Debbie Allen, you're not gonna be disappointed.
 "
Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square,64,52,critic,"
Packed with singing, dancing, cheesiness and conventions, musical lovers will adore Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square; and it's so full of feel good factor and heart that it has more than earned a pass.

Belushi,90,78,audience,- [ ] Now I know what you're thinking. 2 stars for a legend aka John Belushi. I like John Belushi but man this so called documentary did him no justice. I can tell that theirs not a lot of footage of him to use because of his privacy he needed of course. It just sucks what happened to him. Fame can go to peoples heads and it can ruin someone. That's just how it is. Theirs nothing really that the maker of this documentary could've done differently. So I give them some respect but it doesn't make for an interesting film. I was bored out of my mind and wanted some real insight into the mind of John Belushi but we got none. Gosh dang it but they tried their absolute best.

Belushi,90,78,audience,"RIP, sweet prince of comedy. Never forgotten."
Belushi,90,78,audience,"Absolutely a must-see if you’re even slightly a fan. Has the typical documentary formula, though all the interviews are recordings, so they’re played over a ton of great photos. It was insightful to learn so much from his wife Judy and to hear how close him and Aykroyd were. Watch through the end credits, there’s a great song from his wife. "
Belushi,90,78,audience,"What a depressing waste of a life.  And Lorne M comes across as the most petty, controlling, dictatorial producer of all time (and he's got some competition!)"
Belushi,90,78,audience,"Decent but not overly deep doc featuring the words, through interviews, of those who knew Belushi personally, as well as some of his own writing in letters and notes. 6.5/10"
Belushi,90,78,audience,"""Belushi,"" the latest documentary about the legendary actor/comedian from director R.J. Cutler, has some interesting highlights of John Belushi's early life and rise to fame starting with Second City to The Lemmings, followed by his fast heights to stardom with Saturday Night Live, ""Animal House"" and The Blues Brothers, but it felt as though the film only lightly brushed over his struggles with addiction and inner demons. The film does include some good interviews with Belushi's wife Judy, friend and former SNL alumni Dan Aykroyd, the late Harold Ramis and late actress Carrie Fisher."
Belushi,90,78,audience,"Documentary chronicling the rise and fall of one of comedy's most beloved bad boys in John Belushi. 
As told by the people who knew him best his friends and family.  We go through his early family days and introduction into show business to his breakout stint on Saturday Night Live, his formation of the Blurs Brothers and his movie career and of course his constant excessive drug use which caused his early demise.  Insightful interviews with Dan Aykroyd, Carrie Fisher, Harold Ramis and his wife Judy are amongst the many interviewed over the years. 
A fantastic yet heartbreaking look at a troubled genius."
Belushi,90,78,audience,"Covers a intimiate look at a troubling comedians life, which great highs but even bigger lows. Belushi shows this with a careful laugh, but rains in the audience with the upright honesty of destroying someones personal life with everything damaging imaginable."

Packs an emotional punch in its final moments.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
[Sn] engaging and enlightening documentary.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
The barrier that looms over so many posthumous artist biographies isn't broken through here, but Cutler's documentary does get you close up so you can feel the texture and sense the breadth of that wall.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
Through previously unreleased interviews, voice recordings, and archival footage, the film not only explores Belushi's uncommon success, but also his enduring impact on comedy and music.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
Even though Cutler takes creative license, occasionally using animation and intertitles to insert unnecessary commentary for dramatic effect, the impact of the never-heard-before audio is astounding.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
In what may become the definitive study, audiences are invited into his world which is illuminated by friends and loved ones through frank unencumbered conversation.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
It is terribly sad and one more reminder that fame on a mass level can be a curse. Why the best ones rarely feel they deserve it remains a mystery this movie doesn't try to solve.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
The documentary provides a haunting peek behind the scenes at a talented individual who gave his life to make the world laugh and asks a simple question: was it worth it?
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
This felt more like a simple refocusing of our attention, as the parade of greatest-hits clips played on, and the admiring voices commented and sorrowed in turn. Not quite a waste, but a missed opportunity for sure.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
Highlighted by never-before-heard audio interviews that were part of a 2005 oral history, this polished, affecting overview is far from exhaustive but skilfully sums up Belushi's life and death.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
While the guest voices condense the story, and breathe an even-handed life into the material, Belushi works best when it lets Belushi tell his own version.

Thanks in part to Hader's excellent voice work, the footage helps you onto an emotional roller coaster. Belushi's work may be done, but his legacy continues to grow.
 "

When Belushi's story is told through his personal writing, there's a familiar warmth that makes the documentary rise above others.
 "

R.J. Cutler's Belushi is a far more rounded look at the self-destructive comedy great than most of what we have seen before.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
The excellent film highlights the complex persona of a beloved American icon who changed comedy forever.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
""Belushi"" documents his tragic fall, but the focus is not on his notorious overdose -- it's on his heart.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
Engrossing and a must-see for any fan of SNL, Animal House and 20th-century comedy in general.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
A fine doc that examines the too-short life of once-in-a-generation talent who captured the hearts and funny bones of devoted audiences.
 "
Belushi,90,78,critic,"
Cutler's documentary skip-walks a fine line between a great, unstable talent's rise and fall, and between the un-tender trap of addiction and the joyous energy of a Chicago-bred giant.

Holidate,44,40,audience,Best thing Sarah has ever seen
Holidate,44,40,audience,They've made a deal to be each other's dates for all holidays so as to avoid the embarrassment of being single and skip out on the awkward holiday moments.  Of course they fall for each other.  The inevitable is made as painful as possible along the way.
Holidate,44,40,audience,i think 2020 has proved itself how it is bad even in movies.
Holidate,44,40,audience,"I know that this is a generic christmas comedy, but I enjoyed it!
Got to love Emma Roberts."
Holidate,44,40,audience,I liked the whole thing tbh🤷🏾‍♂️Funny and enjoyable!
Holidate,44,40,audience,"Pretty sweet drama that has room for improvement. Liked the cast that was in the movie and the concept of holidate was unique and worthwhile. There were sweet moments between the main characters and the transition from date to partner was standard compared to other movies on happy endings. Despite the surprisingly low rating, I felt it was a fresh one to watch."
Holidate,44,40,audience,"highly trite and 100% predictable but enjoyable enough for background or to pass the time, with Kristen Chenoweth being a significant highlight"
Holidate,44,40,audience,"If this RomCom was a ‘ham and pineapple' pizza, you'd find it in the frozen section, nuke it for 90secs, take one bite... then throw it in the bin!"
Holidate,44,40,audience,Don’t understand the low rating. Some really good laughs and a good cast made this a fun movie
Holidate,44,40,audience,"The romance was amazing at the beginning!- but quickly watered down until it became utterly predictable and I was just done. Some jokes were funny, but most were so vulgar they made me cringe. The idea for the plot was unique, I'll give them that, but the male lead saw no character development (let's be honest- did he ever really have character to start out with?) and after a while I just found everyone (but mostly the girl lead) annoying and repetitive."
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
Rancid self-awareness and a complete lack of sincerity rule the holidate in this shallow rom-com.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
The movie is like those family Christmas dinners, once a year you can bear it but you certainly wouldn't repeat it. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
Holidate is far from a perfect rom-com, but it's a close to ideal distraction for a winter night at home, snuggled on the sofa in pajamas with a glass of Chardonnay in hand.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
...Holidate improves considerably as it progresses...
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
I liked every one of the actors in this film but I didn't like the quagmire of crudeness that permeated just about every scene.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
Instead of doing something interesting and fresh, John Whitesell and his team have chosen to retread the same old eye-roll-worthy rom-com cliches that have plagued the laziest examples of the genre.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
What started as a clever storyline quickly turned into an onscreen groundhog day-situation. The characters became monotonous and somewhat dull.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
This is not the wittiest or funniest rom-com you'll ever see, but there is something about it that keeps things in the watchable zone throughout.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
Holidate fails at being a good rom-com. The film is incredibly messy and it was indeed a struggle to sit through.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
Raunchy romcom has sex, heavy drinking, and language
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
For all there is to criticize, Holidate does surprise us by presenting a relationship with an age gap in a positive way.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
The film tries too hard to be a parody of romantic comedies. Maybe that was the general idea initially but the director seemingly lost touch with it as the film progressed.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
On the upside, Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey share a cute chemistry and both are adequately good in their roles. But that alone isn't enough to make Holidate a holiday treat to crave for.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
I wish the film had the guts to sit here longer, but, instead, it continues with the unnecessary chaos...
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
... Holidate is an often thrifty dose of pure, adulterated entertainment, even if the marketing would have you groan at its seemingly bored premise.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
While the end result is never in question as it goes through the frustrating cliché hoops the genre demand there's still plenty of fun and laughs thanks to Roberts and Bracey.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
Holidateis a great start to the season of holiday rom-coms. It's relatable, it's cute, and it's raunchy. It's not a masterpiece but it is just a damn good start to Christmas - which apparently begins November 1st.

The romantic and comedic pairing of Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey works, and makes for an enjoyable watch.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
Holidate falls in the bland no-man's land between being sharp enough to appeal to adults (à la Bridesmaids) and tame enough to watch with the whole family.
 "
Holidate,44,40,critic,"
Holidate is -- hmm, I need a new word, some kind of portmanteau, to describe how bad it is. I know! It's horriflix.

A Most Beautiful Thing,100,100,audience,"This movie captures some of the ""most beautiful things"" about this sport, the comradery you share with those in your boat, the peacefulness of being on the water, and how you can be years or decades from having rowed but you will always be a rower. Could watch this movie over and over again! Well done!"
A Most Beautiful Thing,100,100,audience,Excellent portrayal of black lives being influenced and changed by positive opportunities. Then these lives influencing more lives. Outstanding
A Most Beautiful Thing,100,100,audience,It captured the beauty and how important teamwork is in this special sport. And the way it forces diverse people to learn to get along is so timely.
A Most Beautiful Thing,100,100,audience,"OUTSTANDING movie!!!! Very well done!!! There truly is a tight bond that happens amongst a crew team & it's like no other. If 2 people on a boat are arguing or not getting along, it throws the whole boat off & they won't do well. U have to be completely in unison on all levels and this documentary did a great job of depicting that. Aside from that, this movie is truly a Most Beautiful Thing!!! This is exactly what our world needs these days. I wish everyone was as open to possibilities and potential friendships as these guys are. If everyone saw each other for the beautiful person we are, the differences that make us each unique and the value we each bring to the table instead of judging people and being biased against people based on certain criteria, this world would be such a more beautiful place!!!! I can't say enough wonderful things about this movie. It is a must see!!!!!"
A Most Beautiful Thing,100,100,audience,"Such a beautifully told, well shot, and heart warming story. It not only sheds light on a very important topic, but also sends a beautiful and crucial message that teamwork can bring together any group of people no matter there differences or backstory. I have never been the kind of person that watches documentaries very often but this one I loved and I guarantee you can enjoy it too. 9/10 film!"
A Most Beautiful Thing,100,100,audience,"See it. See it. See it. Did I say see it? I did. Worth every minute. I love to review movies, but for this one, it's about the poetry of these people shaping their lives through the trauma, then determining to get back in the boat, two decades later, for the kids in their neighborhoods. Good production values, directing and editing; great music. It's worth the look."
A Most Beautiful Thing,100,100,audience,Absolutely awesome documentary
A Most Beautiful Thing,100,100,audience,Great story about what can be accomplished if given the opportunity. A must watch.

While it has the heart of a fairy tale it isn't really one: It's a dream realized, American folklore that is alive, because the Manley Crew Team never would've known what magic they could create with a boat until they were introduced to one...

[The] men from Manley High have a couple of lessons for us all: First, don't assume that everyone who's not on your side is your enemy. And second, it's possible to find common cause with just about anyone, even if you have to keep them at oar's length.

Director Mary Mazzio doesn't do much in terms of filmmaking, but she doesn't have to.

An evocative hip-hop score, poetic narration by Common and crisp graphics appropriately underline the timeliness of the film.

2 Hearts,18,87,audience,Two wet farts came out of my butt
2 Hearts,18,87,audience,"Two Hearts, Zero Stars.  This was one long advertorial for becoming an organ donor and featured bad acting and writing, to boot.  And to top it all off, I'm still not donating any organs."
2 Hearts,18,87,audience,"This was a moving story. Since it was based upon a true story, it made it even more impactful. On the other hand, it was also kind of sad and depression due to the topic and outcome."
2 Hearts,18,87,audience,loved the fact that it was a great true story sad but inspirational.
2 Hearts,18,87,audience,It was a really great movie and I loved the twist
2 Hearts,18,87,audience,"Somewhat predictable, but it was a very entertaining, good-natured movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it"
2 Hearts,18,87,audience,A very good movie It is a tearjerker
2 Hearts,18,87,audience,It was the most remarkable movie i have seen in a while. The love and romance in this movie has brought me to tears. I will definitely watch this movie again.
2 Hearts,18,87,audience,Everyone should see this movie then call someone and tell them you love them.
2 Hearts,18,87,audience,It was a good enough movie. It was short enough and everyone was good looking.
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
2 Hearts is quite contrived and that's what makes it quite heartless.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
There's a heartfelt, inspirational story buried somewhere within the based-on-a-true-story ""2 Hearts,"" if only director Lance Hool knew how to tell it with any clarity or authenticity.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
Harmless, but paper-thin.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
Skovbye and Mitchell are the biggest standouts, striving to bring believability and genuine emotion to the proceedings, but it's hard to resuscitate a project this far gone.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
""2 Hearts"" is an inspirational movie that plays like a Hallmark movie, which is fine with me as the intended messages are brought to the forefront with believable and charming characters. Bring your Kleenex, you may shed a tear or two.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
2 Hearts certainly has an inspiring message. It's just unfortunate that it's delivered in a very uninspired and trite manner by a very corny screenplay and some awkward acting.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
The tropical views throughout 'Two Hearts' are a breathtaking respite from my COVID shut-in environment. It made the mushy, gushy romance just that much easier to lean into.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
A bit fragmented, it's not that bad. The Nicholas Sparks and Hallmark crowd will enjoy a couple of love stories, and hopefully this will inspire people to become organ donors.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
2 Hearts, so overwhelmingly saccharine it plays like a mockery of a parody of a Hallmark movie, features not one, not two, but four lead characters, each with an extreme (possibly terminal?) case of puppy love. That's a litter of puppy love!
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
'2 Hearts' has good intentions, but it flutters with clichés.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
It's clunky at spots and some of the acting occasionally feels a bit rough. And yes, it's as predictable as they come. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
Unfortunately, everything about this film is quite predictable. While it's based upon a true story, the overall tone is that of a Hallmark movie.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
Hackneyed, shallow and lacking chemistry between the leads. It's so saccharine that it might end up giving you a cavity.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
Two sappy love stories eventually collide in 2 Hearts, which has an important message and not too much else.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
2 Hearts has its heart in the right place. It's too bad it's a film that relies way too much on clichés and tropes, ultimately asking the audience to suspend disbelief in ways that are physically impossible.

When Jacob Elordi began delivering one of the cheesiest voice overs in recent memory and the hospital gurney showed up, it was clear that I hopped on a sinking ship.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
This is the sort of film for which the term ""tearjerker"" was invented, but this one jerks them so violently you may need medical attention afterwards.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
It's a softheaded piece of morbid romantic treacle - two parallel cloying love stories for the price of one.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
Works hard to be a glossily uplifting tearjerker in the Hallmark mode, with a heartfelt message at the center. That may be enough for some.
 "
2 Hearts,18,87,critic,"
Very by the books and predictable, but it's hard to believe any of it, despite it being based on a true story.

The Social Dilemma,86,83,audience,"Those ridiculous dramatizations were a complete turn-off for me. The documentary is scary, yes, but at some point, it loses the credibility and eeriness it's supposedly intended to express."
The Social Dilemma,86,83,audience,"Ironically, whilst there are supposedly qualified people sharing topics, it does appear to be fearmongering, creating its own 'Truman show' as was so explicable stated in the film. Whilst I rarely use Social media and am well aware of the dangers, this movie portrays it so poorly that it misinforms users instead, leaving them afraid, rather than informed. Before you watch this movie, if you do, just remember that a lot of what they are saying is misinformation."
The Social Dilemma,86,83,audience,"I was compelled to write this blog after watching The Social Dilemma.  In no way, I am going to proceed to review it.  In fact, I am not even going to respond much to what was discussed.  Well, maybe I will touch on it a little bit.  If you want to know the opinions of what the inventors of social media think of the effects of their creation, feel free to waste your time watching this documentary.

I personally thought that it wasn't particularly insightful or even remotely interesting.

I want to start off by saying that social media in it of itself is not evil or insidious.  I mean, it's a platform to connect with others through electronic means.

I don't think the inventors of social media need to apologize for what they created.  They don't need to apologize for the algorithms they created.  What they should apologize for and what the documentary should have touched on was the morality and motive of these inventors who were behind creating these social media platforms.  There is only one part of the movie that needs to be highlighted.  Not the cringing faces of the inventors from Facebook, Google, etc. who sheepishly stare into the camera claiming regret.  Let's be honest, who gives two cents what their opinions are especially after the repercussion of social media have already run their course and is a major part of the fabric of our existence.  Back to the best part of the documentary if you didn't catch it.

For one minute in the documentary, one lady shares how social media platforms and giant tech industries like Google make their money - like why on earth is Google so rich?  Well, are you ready to hear the answer?  This is probably the only part of the documentary worth watching.  The answer:  Because they sell ad space on their websites.  It is not their job to be the perfect search engine, but rather monitor our behaviors so intuitively and provide this information to businesses who try to sell us things by way of advertising products have basically have been curated for us.  Now I'm thinking, maybe that's not such a bad thing.  Now I feel like I'm finding less fault for these advertisers.  Cause otherwise, how will they make money?

Anyway, the moral issue that stands is the motive of greed.  These tech giants realized that retailers and businesses will pay a lot of money to advertise on their search engine and social media platforms because of the amount of web traffic that occurs on these sites.

If these inventors want to apologize for what they created, they should admit that they were compelled by greed, the desire to make lots and lots of money. And I mean lots and lots and lots of money.

And very sadly, they let it go out of control.  Again, because of their greed.  Greed Greed Greed.  I'm not anti-capitalistic in any way, don't get me wrong.  But there is a right way to be capitalistic, while still having a moral compass and a wrong way, my fingers are pointing at these tech companies.

This documentary shed light on what happens when people hide behind their screens and come up with ideas that no longer have the interests of society at heart, but rather decides to take advantage of people's weaknesses and use it for their own gain.

In conclusion, no one wants to hear these people complain about how they regret what they did because of what kinds of negative effects its having on society.  Because again, it's not the tool that is detrimental.  Social media platforms in itself is a neutral tool; it's the people, the humans who wield the platforms that need to realize that the people they are targeting are people.  And yes, there are effects.  

But I also think that it's the families and schools and tech markets that need to exercise some level of control over the use of these devices.  Like, isn't it more important to diagnose the problem before it becomes a larger problem?  Before it spreads like a cancer?  This movie shouldn't have been called the Social Dilemma.  The proper title should be the Greed of Tech Industries and how it's created a Social Dilemma."
The Social Dilemma,86,83,audience,"É bacana, mas já assisti outro documentário muito parecido 🤔"
The Social Dilemma,86,83,audience,"Definitely must see. When you understand how social media works and what it incentivizes and monetizes, you begin to understand how it sorts people into their own echo chambers of misinformation.  The spread of misinformation is further compounded by people's passive approach to ingesting information as it is rather than taking a more deliberate and active role in testing information and analysis for quality first. We need to treat all information from all sources as if it is tainted and incomplete. Just because people are influential doesn't mean they should be."
The Social Dilemma,86,83,audience,"This documentary does an excellent job informing us about how social works and warning of its considerable dangers, especially the algorithms of 'positive intermittent reinforcement', but merely mentions the simple one root cause of it all: capitalism."
The Social Dilemma,86,83,audience,Disturbing important portrayal of underbelly of social media by people who created/supported its creation.  Gave me a lot to think about.  A little heavily dramatic but likely necessary to pierce the attachment we have to these platforms.
The Social Dilemma,86,83,audience,Great documentary! Must see for all!
The Social Dilemma,86,83,audience,"An urgent documentary covering important information is undercut by a lot of talking heads and some curiously false dramatic enactments that probably could've been handled via some whiz-bang animation. Still, you won't look at your pinging device—be it tablet, cell phone, in-box, etc—again in quite the same way after seeing this, and that's probably a very good thing."
The Social Dilemma,86,83,audience,"Fresh, unique, eye-opening. Makes you think long after the movie ends. Genre-bending. Skyler Gisondo has on-screen charisma."
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
The movie insists that people need to self-censor in regard to social media. If not, the state should step in.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
The Social Dilemma plays as much like a horror movie than a docu-drama in how it pushes our buttons to be afraid, very afraid, of Big Tech.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
""The Social Dilemma"" is the most important documentary of 2020 if you're smart and free enough to take its dire message that social media is a Frankenstein monster killing us like insects drawn to it's grotesque fascination.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
These are all (or mostly) smart people, and within their area of expertise they have smart things to say. The problem is that they are called upon to extrapolate way beyond that and the result is presented as some kind of definitive argument.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
For all its topicality, The Social Dilemma doesn't break any big news... But it's still powerful and persuasive to see all the arguments summed up in one place.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
Even if it's a well-done study on social media, it is still mostly tedious.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
The Social Dilemma is a hard-hitting, nonchalant, and relentlessly engaging documentary that should fire up some useful conversation in the end.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
Truly, this outstanding documentary is scarier than a horror film because it investigates truth in social media, and truth terrifies.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
The film reveals much more than why you go from Googling the best sofa one minute to finding sofa ads on your Facebook stream the next.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
Hopefully it will challenge you to put guidance and boundaries to how often you use social media and what you use it for.

The Social Dilemma is an outstanding and indispensable piece to understand the destabilizing dangers that social networks can propitiate. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
Cold marketing on a cosmic scale is one thing, but the human cost of getting people hooked to their devices is the film's primary concern.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
This is a call to action film alerting us of the addiction and the emotional struggles of adults, teens, and children that are using social media.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
As The Social Dilemma shows, entertainers are in no rush to hold us, or themselves, accountable.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
A comprehensive and eye-opening documentary...
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
A straight documentary may have worked better than a fiction hybrid, but ""The Social Dilemma"" is nonetheless a terrifying plea for us to delete our social media accounts. Will you do it?
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
Cautionary and relevant -- a MUST SEE!
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
For many of us, the concept of algorithms is hard to grasp, but this documentary-drama hybrid is imaginative and effective in showing how they work as Silicon Valley veterans unpack many of the myriad horrors they helped create.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
The first documentary I've seen that satisfyingly and compellingly explains exactly what is wrong with the internet age in general and our obsession with social media in particular.
 "
The Social Dilemma,86,83,critic,"
Filmmaker Jeff Orlowski potently illustrates the dark side of social media in a creative way. Definitely an eye-opening + sobering film, even downright terrifying at times, which a good a cautionary tale ought to do.

From the Vine,82,71,audience,A nice story with a predictable ending but entertaining none the less. A feel good movie with good acting and great scenery of the Italian countryside. I also found it pretty amusing at times.
From the Vine,82,71,audience,"Loved it, thought it was quite delightful and heart warming, Loved the photography too."
From the Vine,82,71,audience,"A CEO who has lost the plot of his life story resigns and suddenly rushes to Italy, to recapture some meaning. Lovely cinematography. The storyline is a bit predictable, and still enjoyable."
From the Vine,82,71,audience,Wonderful scenery in an authentic location. Great “take you away” love story. 
From the Vine,82,71,audience,"Great photography, great setting, bad acting, bad script."
From the Vine,82,71,audience,"From the Vine was a great experience for me, as an immigrant from South Western europe, the locales of the small Italian town reminded me of my childhood in an endearing way. The way that the townsfolk behave compared to the way Joe Pantoliano's character perceives his environment draws a great contrast and emphasizes on that distinction between the locals and the local who has become a stranger and returned back to their home a changed man.

On the more technical side, the film is admirable to say the least. The warm colour pallette evokes a true feeling of calmness and of pleasure in existence. The small Italian town that hosts most of the films scenes appears to be an oasis in the desert of modern living. Through color light and shadow, the cinematographer gives the town the ability to become one more character in the story.

I recommend the film to people of all ages and i would encourage families to watch it together with their loved ones. This story of dreams and of ""reverse Immigration"" is sure to leave you with a smile on your face and a curiosity to explore your family's lineage."
From the Vine,82,71,audience,"From The Vine, was a pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting this film to bring so much joy and lift up my mood, especially in times like this. The beautiful landscapes and on top of that the brilliant performance by Joe Pantoliano, my main reason to watch this film, really brings a whole different atmosphere to this film.

Through brilliant pacing, acting, director and, cinematography this film manages to immerse you in its world and with that make you care about its characters and take you on a beautiful journey of hardship and perseverance."

From the Vine,82,71,audience,"I watched this film with my mom and we both really enjoyed, which is impressive in its own way since its hard for us to find a film we both love.

The narrative was relatable, cohesive and with just the right amount of romantic flair. Some of the shots in the film were so aesthetically beautiful, it made me wish I could be there in person. Wendy Crewson and Paula Brancati gave great performances as well, bringing a lot of depth to their characters and played well off one another in their shared scenes. Aside from the beautiful script and breathtaking cinematography, the film taught me things about Acerenza and the wine-making process that wouldn't of even crossed my mind (i.e the candle in the cellar). It's almost like a small documentary was tucked into the film, and I can appreciate when a film has so many layers to it.

The best part of the film for me was that it was so relatable. In today's world where our work lives have been disrupted by current events... It was nice to watch a film that told you ""It's okay to start over. Work and money isn't all that life has to offer."".. which is a really beautiful kind of message that people, myself included, need right now. It's just such a feel good film."
From the Vine,82,71,audience,"From The Vine brings heart, warmth and a sense of hope to a world that is in much need of it.



For a person like me who typically doesn't watch films such as this, I was completely amazed at how much From The Vine affected me in a positive way.



I watched this film knowing only that it was related to wine and it was set in Italy. As I was watching, I quickly found out that its not only about wine and the beauty of Italy, its about finding your true self, the importance of family and that having money and success isn't the most important thing in life, leaving you to appreciate what you have and who you have around you.



Through the great storyline, the perfectly timed comedic elements, the beautiful cinematography, the wonderful direction and the amazing performances from Joe Pantoliano, Marco Leonardi, Paula Brancati, Wendy Crewson and so many other amazing actors in the film, From The Vine draws you in right away and takes you on a beautiful journey that will leave you smiling by the end credits."
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
Doesn't add anything to the soul-searching travelogue genre but the point of these movies is not to reinvent the wheel. Like rom coms, the most formulaic variety of mass entertainment there is, it's the journey not the individual stops along the way.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
From the Vine is a less-infuriating-than-usual stab at a storyline that usually just reeks of entitlement and narcissism. Writing today, at the end of an appalling year, let's call that a win.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
Sweet, sentimental, and structured storytelling that offers no unpleasant surprises.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
Unlike the vintage wine that's supposed to be in the movie, the film's moldy humor does not get better with age ... The only thing that comes out looking good in the movie is Italy's gorgeous landscape.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
This is a warm movie with a big heart, exploring enormously important issues in a way that's never remotely pushy or preachy.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
From the Vine provides exactly what you expect and little else - light entertainment for an oppressively dark time.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
Some may know of Pantoliano from his ""Sopranos"" days; here he radiates the screen in every frame of the gorgeous Italian countryside. It's as if he was meant to play the role; it's refreshingly old-fashioned storytelling that scores high notes.

Curl up with a nice glass of Antinori Tignanello and enjoy.

It's a fairly small-scale film, so it's not as though more was really needed, but it doesn't amount to much.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
From the Vine may prove pleasing and, yes, there's all that scenery, idealized to the max, as is everything else in this Italo-escapist massage of a movie.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
It's good natured, but ""From the Vine"" often seems forced and artificial.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
Joe Pantoliano balances charisma and charm in a welcome starring role in this innocuous comedy about starting over and rediscovering your roots.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
The cast is completely adequate and the movie itself, especially when it goes into flights of fantasy, is strictly average.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
If you're in the right mood for vicarious travel, wine and lawyer-jokes in Italian, this hits the spot.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
Playing a restless CEO fleeing his corporate and familial responsibilities in Toronto for the vineyards of Italy, Pantoliano gives a curious edge to the film, turning a stock hero into something a titch more complicated and compelling.
 "
From the Vine,82,71,critic,"
A film that feels rather old fashioned in I wish they made more of these films kind of way rather than being outdated.

No masterpiece but an ok light travelogue.

The Broken Hearts Gallery,79,88,audience,"It's been a while since they made a good rom com but the right here ticked all of the boxes. Fun and fresh, definitely a good choice!"
The Broken Hearts Gallery,79,88,audience,"This might be an actual perfect film. Everything, and I do mean everything is excellent in this movie. The chemistry, acting, casting, plot, script, locations, soundtrack... literally everything is wonderful. I was grinning throughout this movie like a lunatic. Rewatched it immediately after finishing it. It is fantastic!"
The Broken Hearts Gallery,79,88,audience,"There is a zero percent chance Dacre Montgomery would be with the lead in real life. So it was too unbelievable to enjoy. Borderline stupid, he deserves better as he was the only decent character and actor "
The Broken Hearts Gallery,79,88,audience,"Lots of Rom, not enough Com

I can't really see this movie being spoken about for doing anything revolutionary, having any quotable lines, or inspiring you to fall in love/breakup. It's really just cute millennial background noise."
The Broken Hearts Gallery,79,88,audience,"A+ man! ;) [This part is only added because the system wouldn't accept a critic as short as ""A+ man! ;)"", please disregard anything following the first occurrence of ""A+ man! ;)"" in this critic] ................. Cheers! MFers!!"
The Broken Hearts Gallery,79,88,audience,"Classic romantic comedy with not much originality. Forgettable and not really funny or romantic but it passed the time, I didn't like the cast as well."
The Broken Hearts Gallery,79,88,audience,"I found this to be a gorgeous, simple Rom Com. Geraldine Viswanathan is an absolute standout. I once saw her in a small theatre production in Sydney, amazing to see how far she's come."
The Broken Hearts Gallery,79,88,audience,A good example of where the trailer was better than the movie.  Very formulaic.
The Broken Hearts Gallery,79,88,audience,Pretty good entertaining rom com starring the girl from blockers and the dude from power rangers. This is a rare romantic comedy type movie for me. Normally they would be all cringe and this movie has its fair share of cringe but it's the right amount of cringe at times. Other times it's too much cringe and you want to blurt out get back together already. In those moments this movie falls backs a few steps. But I don't think that the point of this movie was to be the next game changer rom com that defines the 2010s. It's a fun time at the movies and bring a date but only if you've been dating for at least a month or two. Any shorter than this movie might make or break your relationship in a snap. Who knows. This isn't the notebook. Anyway I'm getting off topic. In the end this is a fun movie with sweet characters with a hint of cringe. I recommend this movie.

Ultimately, The Broken Hearts Gallery. which counts pop star Selena Gomez among its executive producers, hits a lot more right notes than wrong ones.

The Broken Hearts Gallery is a perfectly pleasant movie with actors who have winning personalities. It's unlikely to garner many raves, but as a nice distraction amid the bad stuff going on in the world, it fits the bill.

The Broken Hearts Gallery is an endearing and affable rom-com that overcomes its predictability, continuity gaffes and insistent comedy with a fantastic cast, an interesting premise and amusingly droll dialogue from writer/director Natalie Krinsky.

Geraldine Viswanathan is hugely engaging as the memorabilia-obsessed New York gallery assistant.
 "

The Broken Hearts Gallery doesn't break any new ground in the genre, but what it lacks in originality it more than makes up for in charm.

The Broken Hearts Gallery admirably commits to its rather cheesy premise, and Krinsky skilfully provides space for all her comic actors to shine.

There's enough style and, um, heart in Krinsky's ultra-romantic vision to carry the film through.

Stuntwomen: The Untold Hollywood Story,100,,audience,"Stuntwomen: The Untold Hollywood Story is a 2020 documentary taking a look at the history, struggles, and lives of some of the leading stuntwomen in the entertainment business.  The film is based on a book by Mollie Gregory.  It is an enlightening, behind the scenes look at some of the most interesting and exciting action movies and television projects of modern times; all from the vantage point of the female stunt performers.

The movie pays homage to some of the pioneers of stunts, including Jeannie Epper, Julie Ann Johnson, and Jadie David.  I found Amy Johnston‘s ‘sit-down"" with Jeannie Epper to be one of the most compelling and moving aspects of the film.  Amy Johnston is someone to watch closely on both sides of the camera.

Taekwondo Life Magazine has been at the forefront of highlighting some of these talents; particularly, modern stunt artists with martial arts pedigrees.   Amy Johnston, Cheryl Lewis, and Thekla Hutyrova, prior guests, were all featured in the film.  Mindy Kelly, Lauren Mary Kim, and Gabriella Corvina, who have been featured in our forum, are also building great legacies in this genre but were, sadly, omitted.

When watching the film I couldn't help but think of my interview with legendary stuntman, Steven Lambert, where he recounted how he, reluctantly, was forced to stunt for female actresses.  This need came, not out of a lack of desire to have women perform these stunts, but from a lack of female performers to choose from.  From that perspective this documentary does highlight how far the industry has come in expanding the pool of gifted, daring, and talented women willing to risk their safety for the sake of popular entertainment.  

This is an enjoyable and important film and I recommend it despite Shout Factory‘s ignoring our request for a screener's copy."

Wright's fascinating and entertaining documentary about the unsung heroines of film and TV shows it's still sometimes two steps forward and one step back (probably in high heels and off a tall building).

While the documentary successfully champions stunt women's dignity in the workplace, it lacks finesse - failing to showcase their talents in a way that would be exciting for an audience outside the industry.

While the result may be scattershot at times, the achievements of these badass professionals are worth a look - especially if, like this writer, you believe an Oscar category for stunt performers is long overdue.

In a way, Stuntwomen also makes the case for a stunt ensemble Oscar even if the film doesn't outright say it.

David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,audience,"Very moving, energetic and full of positive energy!"
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,audience,"This is one of the rare movies I have kept on my DVR to watch again, in spite of the need to free up some space.  Thank you David Byrne and Spike Lee for an incredible presentation!"
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,audience,"Absolutely stunning. I would find it hard to imagine anybody NOT being dazzled by this. 

Byrne gives a combination of wildly ecstatic music, spectacular and innovative dance, psychological examination of his own acknowledged autism, pointed (but not overplayed) political statement, and TED-talk by the world's coolest philosopher.

Any of these alone would be fascinating - combined they're dazzling. Joy, humour and delight pour from the stage, and even though you could categorise this as a ""concert movie"", he has re-invented the genre. Every person on stage seems to be having the time of their lives, and it's utterly infectious. A must-see"
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,audience,"If you are a David Byrne fan, or have seen anything he has created, it is a must see."
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,audience,"Although there's plenty of reasons to admire the films of Spike Lee, and singer David Byrne (who was part of Talking Heads, not it's sole creative force despite album credits) - this live music doco actually gets pretty damned boring about 35% of the way in.

Regardless of reviewer hype - the actual gig consists of the following: well rehearsed live music with good intonation, people in bland grey office suits and bare feet doing staged, awkward and uncool dance moves, pretty nondescript bits of stage banter between songs. 

Byrne first appears in the MINIMALIST (see what I did there, used a fancy word like I'm a private school graduate or something) *ahem* minimalist stage production holding a plastic brain, talking/singing about the brain. He has great intonation and the track is (almost) interesting, but I feel like Laurie Anderson is about to walk onstage and start playing a series of randomised words from a tape deck to amaze (critics?) with the apparently artistic qualities juxtaposition and decontextualisation.

Did I mention the bland grey office suits and dorky stage dancing? There's little warmth or soul in the proceedings either. Fans of the era's slightly faceless, compressed audio will find that sound approximated on ""American Utopia"", with some rather lovely percussion sounds also. Casual viewers would be better checking out the groups earlier album releases, or Demme's earlier concert film Stop Makin Sense."
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,audience,"Depending on your taste in David Byrne's music, American Utopia is a great musical essay about our want and need to connect to each other. Blending in with the large band at times himself, and pointing out his own follies, Byrne brilliantly reminds us realize he's as human as the rest of us. Fantastic musicality with minimal props or backgrounds make the poignant moments even more so - yup, I cried. Spike Lee's direction more than makes up for us not being there and one poignant song in general is made all the more impactful by his skilled eye. Brilliant and entertaining show."
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,audience,"""Unfortunately, I am what I am."" This thing is nearly impossible to categorize. Concert + Broadway production + ""one""-man show + avant-garde performance art + Ted Talk + stand-up comedy + VH1 Storytellers. It's unique and weird, yet utterly unpretentious, a joint celebration and critique of human nonsense. The songs rule, the band rules, the choreography rules, Spike Lee rules, David Byrne rules. I couldn't wait to watch it again, even while I was still watching it."
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,audience,Destined to be a timeless classic.
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,audience,"An exhilarating, exciting and poignant meditation on the American Experience. Spike Lee's style, amazing choreography, and classic Byrne songs make this a concert film - and viewing experience - like no other."

David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
It's the best party around.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
What they've managed to do is create a permanent record of this amazing show, which I think will go down as one of the most meticulously crafted and contemplated performances by a major musician in history.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
It's the best movie experience I had this pandemic year.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
Directed by Spike Lee, David Byrne's American Utopia is a largely delightful musical presentation, a filmed version of Byrne's 2019 Broadway show.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
American Utopia is much more earnest [than Stop Making Sense]. It is a bit of a disconnect. But it's a Broadway show, and Broadway has to be earnest.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
American Utopia is a gem. A concert film that, like ""Stop Making Sense"" redefines what live performance can be.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
Lee captures Byrne and his team of musicians, dancers, and vocalists as they bend, wobble, and declaim collectively.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
Spike Lee's film of Byrne's sold-out Hudson Theater run is respectfully faithful to the stage performance, with a few deft embellishments.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
The exquisite blend of artistry, humanity and fervent politics makes American Utopia as much a David Byrne movie as a Spike Lee one.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
Ultimately, the big draw here is less the music and the message than Byrne himself; he may be older and stiffer, but he still goes for it like nobody else.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
Fans will love it not just for the music, not just for his singular stage charisma and philosophical musings, but also for the startling look of the thing.
 "

Director Spike Lee and musician David Byrne have created a crowd-pleaser with this spry concert film of Byrne's 2018 tour turned Broadway performance.
 "

It would have been a miraculous celebration of neighbourly love even if it hadn't been released in the middle of a pandemic. But, in these circumstances, that sense of temporary relief feels intoxicating.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
Bolstered by Lee's trenchant, intimate direction, Byrne reframes a peerless setlist of songs as a testament to hope and humanity that implores himself and his audience to keep going.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
[As] Byrne and Co. belt out songs about loneliness, TV viewing, consumerism, and - in a sequence etched into my brain - police killings, American Utopia becomes something else entirely
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
For fans, this will be something to treasure, but Byrne's hits have broad appeal, his political engagement adds a sense of purpose, and his unusual brand of positivity means the whole thing acts as a welcome lift for the spirits.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
It could well be my favourite shot of any movie this year.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
This is Byrne's show, but it's also Lee's tale of the unexpected. Enjoy.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
Lee is inventive in his shooting, without being flashy - particularly in his use of an aerial camera above the stage and another at the back at barefoot level, both capturing elements that an audience on the night would not be able to see.
 "
David Byrne's American Utopia,98,86,critic,"
Byrne hasn't lost anything of what he always had, and Spike Lee does interesting things with the camera, but it's hard to avoid envying the real audience we see singing and dancing in the grand Hudson Theatre.

Fatima,59,94,audience,Beautifully acted. Uplifting message. We need more like this Hollywood!
Fatima,59,94,audience,NOT true it was a hoax
Fatima,59,94,audience,"Overall, Fatima is quite an uplifting drama film. Regardless of one's faith, Fatima leaves its audiences with positive thoughts and its viewers thinking. The Children's performances were also quite impressive, especially given the dramatic themes which would have been a real challenge for young actors to bring to life.  The directing style feels basic but somewhat practical.  Final verdict?  This film is certainly worth a look - Walkden Entertainment"
Fatima,59,94,audience,Very well done film. An interesting look at the events in Fatima and a good look at the idea of faith. Beautifully shot and well acted... a bit slow moving at times but still a quality film. Highly recommended.

An attempt at an interesting political affray that ends in an illusion. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
""Fatima"" is a gorgeous film with inccredible performances by all cast members. The beautiful, majestic voice of Andrea Bocelli sets a spiritual and haunting tone of the film.
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
Sure to be adored by religious types despite its faults, this tries to maintain a wary and neutral tone... But, as a wise man once said, you've got to have faith. You've gotta have faith...
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
If you are a believer, then just as with that wall in Apia, you will quite possibly see in Fatima a beauty and truth that I was blind to. And that is truly just fine.
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
The film may be of interest for the devout, but otherwise it's a plodding meander that tells of a slightly intriguing footnote of early 20th century history.

""The reverential film will not change the minds of either believers or doubters.

The child actors don't quite deliver on the demands of a script that requires they believe their lines in order to get us to believe the film.
 "

A smooth, reverential account that will be embraced by believers but is unlikely to convert doubters.
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
Faith drama based on true story has some war imagery.
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
The film's probe of emotional layers within belief systems is half-hearted, missing an opportunity to bring new perspective to the true-life source material.
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
The message of the Virgin, less consoling than apocalyptic, is visualized by Pontecorvo in sometimes lurid terms.
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
...presents us with a story that is baffling superstitious twaddle, expecting the viewer to go on the ride.
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
The real missed opportunity in ""Fatima"" is in the framing story, decades later, as Lucia (played by Sonia Braga), an elderly nun, invites a skeptical theological scholar (Harvey Keitel) to interview her.
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
It balances reasonable questions with unassailable faith. And it treats with enormous delicacy what has, for more than 100 years, made the miracle of Fatima fascinating even to those who do not believe in miracles
 "
Fatima,59,94,critic,"
The secrets of Fatima are included if you look closely, as are Mary's pleas to pray the rosary, to avoid sin and to do good.

☆6/10"
Words on Bathroom Walls,90,94,audience,"When i saw Charlie Plummer in King Jack.  His progress hasn't developed as well as I'd hoped and it's been mostly one note.  'Words on Bathroom Walls', elevates Plummer to heights not before reached in a challenging roll.  The film walks a gimmicky tightrope.  At times it's formulaic and there are a couple scenes that don't quite fit, but the moral here is an important one for parents and kids alike.  Don't let your negatives define you.  The gimmicks may not be for you, but they galvanized the movie for me.  It's by no means perfect, but it is respectful towards mental illness in an inventive and vivid fashion.  Final Score 8/10"
Words on Bathroom Walls,90,94,audience,A tear jerker but beautiful movie.
Words on Bathroom Walls,90,94,audience,This movie was so touching and I loved how it brought awareness to schizophrenia because us ignorant people can be very judgmental. This helps people know that they are regular people just dealing with an illness but they are not the illness itself
Words on Bathroom Walls,90,94,audience,A little sugar-coated but sweetly endearing nonetheless.
Words on Bathroom Walls,90,94,audience,"Words on Bathroom Walls is a teen drama with a beating heart and a clear mind. Whilst not an exceptional film it's a very pleasant addition to the young adult film market. The film is the story of Adam, a high school student who suffers from schizophrenia. He suffers from visions and massive mood swings. His father leaves the family home but his mother does everything she can in support. After a psychotic episode at school he eventually agrees to a new form of medication. He is also transferred to a Catholic school where he meets the high achieving Maya who he forms a strong bond with. Adam is also a budding chef and he finds the medication, whilst stoppping his episodes, affects his taste and other senses. Without knowing a lot about schizophrenia this film does appear to handle the issue with sensitivity and intelligence, so it's definitely to be applauded for that. The film perhaps could have dug deeper into the emotional trauma but it still does have its powerful moments. The two leads are very strong. Charlie Plummer and Taylor Russell are two great young talents for sure. There are some rather mawkish scenes and the teenage love scenes are typical tropes but on the whole this is a well written, smart teen drama with plenty to recommend."

Unhinged,48,77,audience,"Terrible, too many plot holes and way too unbelievable. Why call the cops when you can just waste massive amounts of time; makes total sense"
Unhinged,48,77,audience,Awful script. So stupid. I have no sympathy with either of the woman or russell Crowe’s characters. Her stupidity brought on so many people’s death. If this is American culture. Well maga should look at making the culture better. So many sick heads in America 
Unhinged,48,77,audience,Pure rage! Maybe after watching this you'll be less likely to shot the bird at someone or at least understand the courtesy honk.
Unhinged,48,77,audience,"I created a Rotten Tomatoes account, specifically for this movie. The entire move after the 60 minute mark is utter nonsense. Why isn't the woman calling the cops, and telling them where he is? why are the cops arriving alone? why did the school let her take her son out? All of these Things are hardly the tip of the iceberg. The movie had poor acting apart from the antagonist. A combined 6 braincells were present in this movie, and more than 6 characters were on screen. If Rotten Tomatoes allows for a rank below Rotten, this movie would be the face of it."
Unhinged,48,77,audience,"The theaters are open again and we're welcomed back with Russell Crowe, who's having a bad day! Crowe stars as Tom Cooper (although he's credited as ""The Man""), who has nothing left to live for, has mental problems, abuses prescription medication, and who wants to inflict pain and punishment before going out in a blaze of glory. The film starts out without any dialogue, which is very powerful. We see Crowe commit his first act of violence, displaying his apathy and brutality, that sets the tone for the rest of the film (this is definitely not a man to be trifled with). It hooks you in before introducing the rest of the trio: Rachel (played by Caren Pistorius) and her son Kyle (Gabriel Bateman). What starts out as a simple misunderstanding, that could have been diffused, quickly turns in to a deadly game of cat-and-mouse. Yes, there is a bit of suspension of disbelief, but it's still a fun ride. The film and story start out good for the first 30-45 minutes, but about three quarters in, it starts to lose air and the ending feels rushed. Crowe really shines in this, from his accent, to the weight he had to put on for the film (hopefully he put weight on for the film and this isn't just ""all natural Russell Crowe), to the way this harkins to 1993's FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas. I will also give credit to Caren Pistorius as she played a passable Rachel. A woman who's likewise down on her luck as a single mother, trying to provide for her child, and is now being stalked by a mad man. Two characters in somewhat similar situations who choose to deal with their frustrations and angry in decisively different ways."
Unhinged,48,77,audience,"This is a good movie, doesn't get into all the Hollywood nonsense.  Fun ride and good acting, director does a good job.  Should make you think next time you want to be a jerk while driving.  Russell Crowe is great."
Unhinged,48,77,audience,"The actress is weak, Crowe is always believable but this story is just to unrealistic to keep you interested. watch on fast forward to watch 10 to 15 mins of good action scenes. "
Unhinged,48,77,audience,"Once more Russell Crowe shows how good actor he is. Great message (be kind to everyone). It is real-time ride into hell.
 Must watch."
Unhinged,48,77,audience,Terrible - not believable at all. Very difficult to relate to the protagonist or antagonist.
Unhinged,48,77,audience,"Although I'm jot a movie buff, I must admit some parts annoyed me, some parts frustrated the ever living hell out of me but Russell Crowe killed it. We need more of his back story. The CG was shotty at best and for the love of goodness, who drags a flipped over minivan, that was very unbelievably turned over by a car the third of its mass, up on to a flat bed tow truck? Also the beginning wasn't necessary."
Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
As a study of an emasculated man seeking revenge it brings to mind Falling Down, Michael Douglas' 1993 black comedy, except Unhinged is all darkness and no comedy.
 "
Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
If there's an underlying message other than 'don't be rude to other drivers because they might be having a worse day than you,' I missed it.

Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
An honest and straightforward entertainment, as violent as viciously fun.

Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
A quick, fun little nail-biter.
 "
Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
As long as it doesn't even pretend to have thoughts in its ugly little head, it's reasonably okay at being disreputable... Unfortunately, it tries to think rather too often.
 "
Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
A vile, nasty piece of work, this paranoid thriller gives vent to the frustration so much of us are feeling in an exploitive manner that is borderline offensive.
 "
Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
No one shows anger boiling in the stomach quite like Crowe, who finds a way to kick-start this material - vicious trash, at a glance - by touring us around a mindset that's impressively credible in the circumstances.
 "
Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
A slasher movie on wheels. It ain't for the squeamish.
 "
Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
This trashy anxiety-fest completely delivers upon what little it promises.

Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
The bones of an enjoyable thriller are here. But there's no meat on them.

Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
Unhinged gleans some jump scene shock value out of its death blows.
 "
Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
Further entrenchment into the mania so many of us are trying to move beyond in some meaningful measure. And yet not a bad movie as much as one that unwisely bit off more than it could chew and then had even more larded on its representational plate.

[Director] Derrick Borte pulls no punches when comes to depicting the violent consequences of road rage in an unapologetically B-movie vibe.
 "
Unhinged,48,77,critic,"
If there's a redeeming feature it's Russell Crowe, who gives the Man, a kind of old fashioned fury, complete with the bourbon-dipped accent.

The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
What also makes the film have some charm is how the screenplay by Sarah Rothschild has a lot of genuine humor in it.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
[Ken] Marino steps up to turn a largely thankless role into the movie's most interesting subject.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
The Sleepover is the movie equivalent of plain oatmeal or a saltine - bland and unexciting, but not actively unpleasant...It isn't nutritious or all that satisfying, but it's familiar and it'll do in a pinch.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
""The Sleepover""is an outrageous, silly family-centered film for the everyone, similar to the ""Spy Kids"" movies.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
The kind of vanilla, disposable product one imagines might've played on the Disney Channel around the turn of the century.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
As harebrained, mostly clean, overly convoluted, somewhat hyperactive, kinda funny, family-friendly movies-that-need-a-quiet-place-to-calm-down-a-little-bit go, The Sleepover is wholly watchable.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
A family-friendly action movie, The Sleepover has it all - adventure, humor, silliness, heartwarming lessons, sweet dance moves, and a delightful cast.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
The real strength of The Sleepover is the kids. Kevin and Clancy, played by Disney Channel regulars Maxwell Simkins and Sadie Stanley, are hilariously authentic.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
The smart-mouthed young son (Maxwell Simkins) is hysterically funny and a natural comedian.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
It's the spark of an idea, given an execution that's strictly mild.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
Nothing about ""The Sleepover"" will surprise, and at its best, that's a comfort; at its worst, it will put you right to sleep.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
As ""The Sleepover"" juggles the genres of heist movie, action thriller, scavenger hunt and teen/tween comedy, it never finds an identity which it slips into effortlessly, the way a good thief can.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
Sie is not reinventing the genre wheel here, and many of her set pieces feel made-for-TV flat, but she appears to be having as much fun as her budget allows.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
Sie elicits mostly spontaneous, credible performances from the younger cast, who deliver their wisecracks and banter with aplomb and only occasionally edge into annoying child-actor pertness.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
Family-friendly action tale has humor, mild violence.
 "
The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
It's wacky, but surprisingly funny and powered by an amusing cast.

It's all played so broadly that the film simply lurches loudly from one mundane action scene to the next.

The Sleepover,70,49,critic,"
The Sleepover is the family adventure-comedy for a new generation.

Made in Italy,49,41,audience,"Made in Italy is the escape that we could all do with at the moment. It's pleasant viewing, with the chemistry between real-life father and son clear to see. It does play it quite safe but we're warmed by this Tuscan sun."
Made in Italy,49,41,audience,"A quiet, nice little film with a genuine heart at its core. "
Made in Italy,49,41,audience,"Woo boy. I love James D'Arcy but he should stick to acting. This film was full of cliched dialogue, cliched characters, and bad acting. 

Of course, the hot Italian chef drives a vintage red Alfa Romeo convertible. 
Of course she has a dashing but evil ex-husband with slicked back hair. 
Of course there's a crazy, spiritual nut job who wears crystals and feels the house's energy.  
Of course there's a tire swing over the pond. Of course Jack falls off the swing and as the hot chef tries to pull him out of the pond he pulls her in and they have their first kiss in the moonlight.
Of course the charming ristorante on the town square is filled with loud, boisterous  Italians drinking and singing like they'd won the lottery. 
Of course there's a loud 5-piece band in the teeny tiny ristorante. 
Of course there's a vintage Vespa rusting away for 20 years that is suddenly zipping around.
Of course there's a slo-mo shot of a sexy woman slurping her bucanti while the men gaze. 
Of course there's an insufferable clueless Brit-Bro in driving loafers, a pastel polo, and a pink sweater tied around his shoulders. And his bleached blond DD  girlfriend teetering around taking selfies and giggling. 
Of course the Italian workmen bicker with each and talk all at once. 
Of course just as the lovestruck young man is about to approach his new flame he sees her with her ex and kid. Don't worry! They get together after all!
Of course there's a ferret in the bathroom and we get a series of lazy close-ups of the timid men's eyeballs peering through the keyhole. 

Oh so many bad close-ups. Why so close, James D'Arcy?"
Made in Italy,49,41,audience,Good movie.  Makes you think about life and values.
Made in Italy,49,41,audience,"Lovely scenery, good music, I enjoyed seeing Liam Neeson, Micheál Richardson and

Made in Italy,49,41,audience,I'm not finished watching and I can't believe that I got so far into this film...what is happening in Liam Neeson's life?
Made in Italy,49,41,audience,"This the the cheesiest and worst movie I have seen for years. It was so bad my wife and I walked out. I NEVER do that. The revolting predictability, cutesy plot, and the terrible acting of Neeson's son - is pretty much the definition of nepotism. He was hopeless. Awful movie. We actually felt like asking for our money back. Yes it was that bad!"

With its title showcasing its only real asset, this flaccid little film would have been better if it had set aside the drama and just let us watch the paint dry.

The worst parts of the film ring hollow and feel forced, but the best parts should meet the expectations of those searching for a perfectly nice little movie to watch with their mom.

If you can't travel to Italy this year, Made In Italy can be your stay-at-home choice.
 "
Made in Italy,49,41,critic,"
Has a little bit of everything to make for a pleasant and pleasantly moving film, with the father-son dynamic of Neeson and Richardson especially strong.
 "
Made in Italy,49,41,critic,"
With its delicious cast and setting, Made in Italy promises a lot but delivers very little.
 "
Made in Italy,49,41,critic,"
If that set-up sounds corny, that is because it is, and actor James D'Arcy, making his directorial debut, is ill-equipped to excavate anything in his screenplay that feels fresh or profound.
 "
Made in Italy,49,41,critic,"
It is a shame that watching Neeson and Richardson... bond is the only saving grace in an otherwise mawkish, cliched tale of grief, regret, healing and new beginnings.
 "
Made in Italy,49,41,critic,"
""Made in Italy"" has a good heart, but it's too by-the-numbers to emotionally register with an audience.

Made in Italy,49,41,critic,"
A treacly slog with a screenplay that fails the storied talent of its elder lead, and the promising gifts of his younger counterpart.

Poignant father-son dramedy has strong language.
 "

...a distinctly awkward drama with an almost roman a clef aspect that feels weird, strained and uncomfortable.
 "
Made in Italy,49,41,critic,"
Made In Italy is the feature directing debut of actor James D'Arcy, who also wrote the screenplay. In choosing to frame the story around the relationship between father and son, he takes the so-called ""Tuscan villa"" movie to a welcome new level.
 "
Made in Italy,49,41,critic,"
There is plenty of Tuscan countryside to look at while the characters are figuring out what we already know.
 "
Made in Italy,49,41,critic,"
Cushions any potentially hard-hitting emotional content in favor of a cutesy travelogue in Tuscany and artificial plot constructs that result in a very pretty film with a divided heart.

More than doors are going to be unlocked and more than floorboards are going to be hammered out between the two amid the idyllic Italian cypresses.
 "
Made in Italy,49,41,critic,"
While admittedly pleasant, Made in Italy's milquetoast delivery severely undercuts its promising set-up.
 "

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,audience,"Anyone who dislikes this movie has bad breath, bad style, bad manners and most importantly, bad breath.

This is a good film."
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,audience,"This is a fun, feel-good comedy and I loved it.  Yeah, it's silly and campy at times, but it's all part of the fun.  And there is lots of singing, which just adds to the fun.  I've never seen the actual Eurovision contests, but it had the feel of a real contest.

And how can anyone not love Rachel McAdams.  She plays such a sweet, lovable character.  I recently watched Wedding Crashers again, and I was curious who the wonderful female lead was in the movie.  Sure enough, it was Rachel McAdams.  So she's one of my favorite actors.

It's hard to find good comedies these days, but this one hits all the right notes."

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,audience,"This movie was quite fun, with some silly slapstick that should please most music fans! The story is fun, and fresh, despite a little bit cheesy, but overall loads of fun! WIl Ferrell is so funny in this film, and so is Rachel McAdams. They both do funny European accents, even though they sound terrible! The ding dong song is very clever, if a bit offensive! There's quite a bit to enjoy here!"

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,audience,"A good concept and kind of original should become a great film... mas its only normal or good to see.

Had to be a lot better and the potencial was there, no doubt about that!"
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,critic,"
Funny stretches are too few and far between, the viewer really needing to adore the music-filled backdrop of this romp to get the most out of it.
 "
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,critic,"
It's a little too loving of Eurovision's kitschy spectacle to be a satire; a little too sincere to be truly silly, despite Ferrell's ridiculous hair and even more outlandish sweaters.
 "
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,critic,"
123 minutes is a murderous length of time for a comedy.

This is an inherently stupid movie, but it's a Will Ferrell comedy about Eurovision, so you really shouldn't be too surprised.

It's exactly as silly and outlandish as it needs to be, while still paying sincere respect to one of Europe's great cultural quirks.

Not a film so much as two hours of lump-free, vaguely film-like audiovisual paste.

Too long and only fitfully funny. Although it may appeal to a narrow audience of Will Farrell fans who also know a lot about Icelandic culture.

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is an unabashedly goofy, joy-filled, and good-hearted film.

A mostly earnest love letter to the competition's madness, albeit an ode of affection spread over a very uneven two hours.
 "
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,critic,"
Just like the real song contest, it's all a bit silly, goes on far too long and is predictable to a fault. But there's also no denying its warmth, energy and quirkiness, which makes it simply great fun to watch.
 "
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,critic,"
The movie's main failure is Ferrell, who's too old and too far removed from his Elf heyday to be using the same faux naïf notes...

 "
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,critic,"
Sadly, it hits a bit of a bum note. Rather than going all in on the comedy Ferrell, who co-wrote the movie, has attempted a cross-over, mixing in earnest rom-com tropes with his usual buffoon-out-of-water comedy and occasional blurts of surrealism.
 "
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,critic,"
Make no mistake: this is an A to Z Will Ferrell movie, but with its zany humor taken just a notch down. It moves towards emotional territory, balancing between rom-com and inspirational storytelling. Insteresting detour in Ferrell's body of work.
 "
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,critic,"
Fantastic to realize that Rachel McAdams ISN'T being forced to be the straightwoman to Ferrell's madman - both halves of Fire Saga are equally dumb, earnest, silly, absurd characters and it's fun to watch her and Ferrell one up eachother across the film.
 "
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,63,78,critic,"
At its heart, Eurovision Song Contest has a sentimentality to it that just might win people over in the way that Fire Saga earnestly tries to charm audiences -- not by being the most talented but by being their unapologetically corny selves.

Radioactive,62,44,audience,I disclose my bias that I absolutely adore Rosamund Pike and she brings an unrelenting assertiveness to the screen that is rarely seen.  She is so good at playing a character who has been so pushed aside her whole life that she let go of all f**ks and simply demanded what she needed out of life without apology.  I loved the adaption of the story to go into much darker areas without losing its humanity.  Superb scene and set design and performances all around.  The pacing is a bit disjointed at times with large jumps in time but in the end it pays off with a very emotional close.  I consider this a grand tribute to her achievements and the people in her life.
Radioactive,62,44,audience,"Alright as a tribute movie to Marie Curie, but it doesn't have the strength of script-writing to really make it something special as a drama, and its method of telling the story with patchy timeline hops doesn't help. Pike's performance is solid, and makes this watchable. An interesting biographical drama, but one that really should have delivered on the drama too"
Radioactive,62,44,audience,Excellent acting in an otherwise boring and indifferent movie. The subject matter is far more interesting  than the movie.
Radioactive,62,44,audience,"Strong performance by Rosamund Pike, but confusing storyline and excessive imagery at times bring the movie down,"
Radioactive,62,44,audience,"Pike gives it her all, but the film really is totally lifeless. A shameful telling of the achievements of such an interesting woman."
Radioactive,62,44,audience,"As a scientist, I'm always interested in the origins of our knowledge.  Whether or not M. Curie had all the emotional experiences depicted here, it was worth watching."
Radioactive,62,44,audience,"Terrible movie. Terrivle approach. Rosamunde Pike sucks again... She's totally overrated! ""SKIP""!"
Radioactive,62,44,audience,"Radioactive, purtroppo, racconta una storia che avrebbe tutte le credenziali per emozionare, eppure risulta arida di sentimenti per lo spettatore; ed è davvero un peccato.
Ottimo l'inserimento di alcuni flash forward su alcuni avvenimenti possibili solo grazie alle scoperte di Marie Curie; cosi come buona è l'interpretazione di Rosamund Pike.
Peccato davvero che manchi totalmente la parte emozionale ed empatica."
Radioactive,62,44,audience,Horribly done movie on such an awsome person.
Radioactive,62,44,audience,"I think the use of special effects and 3 dimensional story telling is pitch perfect. The jumping back and forth in time to show how like many discoveries, they are seen as miraculous cure alls.  When in fact they are just in their infancy and like most scientific discoveries need many, many years to really be understood and applied beneficially."
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
It's hard to ignore that, in the hands of director Marjane Satrapi and writer Jack Thorne, the film isn't engrossing in its second hour as it is in its first.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
The filmmakers stumble centrally over the relationship between science, technology and class society, as many have done before them.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
Rosamund Pike gives a fine performance as Marie, but the film seemed to me to be overly melodramatic, almost like a soap opera. There were also jarring, and unnecessary digressions in the film to much later events.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
A capable, humanizing, and often lovely look at one of the greatest scientific minds in history.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
Marie Curie's story of bravery, intellect + resilience deserves cinematic treatment and Rosamund Pike portrayed her beautifully. Despite its flaws, I still regard this as a heartfelt tribute to a singular heroine & her legacy.

Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
An exceptional Rosamund Pike. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
As a biopic it has a solid performance by Rosamund Pike as Marie Curie, but the narrative lacks a consistent pacing and it bores me as fast as a radioactive cloud with the tale of science, discovery, and female empowerment. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
Few biopics enjoy the luxury of exploring subjects who can legitimately lay claim to having changed the world.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
...the strangely gloomy approach, and Pike's withdrawn performance, are rather alienating. Garson's Mme Curie might have been less accurate, but she was a more engaging character.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
A thoughtful, creative fictional retelling of a story based on the life and legacy of a remarkable woman.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
This is a film that is both beautiful and unsettling, emphasising that every discovery holds the potential for both good and harm.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
Radioactive feels far too disorientating as a feature, distancing its audience from its subject when it's so apparent it's trying with might to frame her as a figure of admiration.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
Radioactive gives us a hard-fought battle and one that women are still fighting today no matter the field of endeavor.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
A well-appointed but disappointing biopic whose flat-footed screenplay caves to all the cliched ways such movies pander to audiences that supposedly can't accept complicated ideas or another era's norms unless they're spoon-fed in pureed form.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
Curie's relevance shines through the film. She continues to pave the way for women to assert their intelligence and persist in gaining their rightful place in academia and research.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
The film really excels in showing the backbreaking effort that went into a pursuit often thought of as no more strenuous than hoisting a test tube over a Bunsen burner.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
... the film is worth seeing for Pike alone. One of our least appreciated and under-used actors, she's been a canny scene-stealer...
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
A solid biopic, which foregrounds yet another towering performance by the terrific Rosamund Pike.

Gets a bit lost when it takes the Pandora's Box approach to its storytelling.
 "
Radioactive,62,44,critic,"
For all of Satrapi's visual inventiveness in capturing Marie's story and its legacy, the MVP of ""Radioactive"" is Pike, who embodies Marie's flinty brilliance and her impatience that no one takes it for granted that she's a genius.

The Rental,75,45,audience,film that has its tension too bad that for the first 45 minutes of the film nothing happens. the final is meh
The Rental,75,45,audience,it was absolutely atrocious. The most awful film I have ever seen. Dreadful. This was the last movie I will ever watch in my life.
The Rental,75,45,audience,"More anti-White propaganda.  Spoiler- the racist is a White guy and they dehumanize him up until the point you're not suppose to mind his death.  Like half of the movies from Hollywood, if you're looking for subtle propaganda that explains why everyone blames Whites for everything you've found a small piece of the puzzle."
The Rental,75,45,audience,Plays like a lot of other movies of this type in that it's always at least a little bit interesting while adding a few new twists.
The Rental,75,45,audience,"Actor-turned-director Dave Franco's directorial debut sees him dip his toes in gently in a small genre picture that's unambitious but solidly made. Basically: ""Airbnb - the Horror Movie"", the story revolves around two couples who rent a gorgeous looking house by the sea for the weekend. Alison Brie and Dan Stevens plays Charlie and Michelle, while Jeremy Allen White is Charlie's brother and his girlfriend, played by Shelia Vand, happens to be also Charlie's business partner. These intricate, almost incestuous, relationships provide the basis for the first, comparatively quieter, half which, had one not been aware what genre it is, could be the setting for any indie family drama. However the film, with its score and the manner it's shot, is not particular subtle about its intentions so we know something sinister is brooding and it's not long before creepy shots from afar imply, in no uncertain terms, that they are being spied on. While the cast is competent, and there are moments that are enjoyable, most viewers watch this to see how all hell is going to break loose; so it is slightly disappointing that when it does, it falls back onto a rather typical slasher formula, even though it is (mostly) logically constructed and nicely (though for the most part, gore-lessly) executed. Co-written by the director and Joe Swanberg, you watch in hope that the screenplay will deliver something clever and surprising, but the best and cleverest thing is left in the end credits which reveal something truly disturbing, sprung off a novel idea that I hope no one will copy or find inspiration for in real life."
The Rental,75,45,audience,"intriguing....very captivating, but the end left a lot to be desired! never found out the who what when where or whys?!"
The Rental,75,45,audience,"The Rental started as weekend getaway escape for two couples in a secluded and beautiful vacation home which unknown to them they are being surveilled by a killer sinister. It served horror with thriller to us watchers which will surely a hit. But what I found weak in this film were poor character development and climax ending in flat and dull. Actually the first 20 minutes of the film wasn't engaging and I found it pretty boring. It was only started to be a lively film when the conflicts arise like relationship issue and views of the killer in the movie story. The cast of The Rental gave a good and satisfying performance but the development of their characters was unsatisfying. I think the way the characters were written was to be blame for this. Upon the awareness of the conflict they were in, the characters resorted in teenage way of thinking to resolve the conflict and did not level-up their decisions which made a lot of viewers including me cause to hate the characters. The Rental also ended flat and dull for me because the way it reached and executed the climax and ending only raises need for further explanations rather than a satisfying ending. The Rental is a good horror thriller movie but proceed with caution to be disappointed to its story."
The Rental,75,45,audience,A quite entertaining 'who's doin' it' with a few good plot twists.  Good fun for a night in.
The Rental,75,45,audience,Wow that just plain sucked!
The Rental,75,45,audience,Dave Franco shows promise as a filmmaker as he visually captures the proper tone of this thriller with a theme about invasion of privacy. The film's climax tries to punctuate the film's theme but does so sloppily which may leave many viewers unsatisfied.
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
The excellent cast help immensely, and so does the commitment all-round to ensuring this isn't just a cookie-cutter cabin-in-the-woods effort.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
Delivering solid thrills and an ugly portrait of disintegrating relationships, The Rental is a clever meld of drama and horror.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
Two men, a woman both are close to, and the wife of one of them, all spend a weekend on the coast. What could go wrong? Everything?
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
A good horror movie can make even the most well-worn plot devices seem new again, but The Rental never rises above its basic storyline. Dave Franco has done some good stuff as an actor, but his debut feature film barely leaves a mark.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
It's very well made, and the single-location style coupled with some light (and blunt) social commentary is a clear attempt from Franco to create his own Hitchcockian thriller.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
The plot mechanism is simple enough - half the characters are too busy covering up for the crimes they have committed to defend themselves adequately against the crimes of which they are the victim - but it shreds your nerves nicely.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
A tale built on people's prejudices, misconceptions and misunderstandings (including the audiences'), The Rental may not reinvent the genre or rock your world, but it's well worth checking out.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
...a seriously impressive debut from a thoroughly promising new filmmaker.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
The Rental can be quite clichéd, using a variety of familiar tropes, but it's a decent directorial debut and impressively tight. Put it down for a late night watch or second movie in the night kind of watch.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
Billed as an indie slasher, it works even better as a wickedly unsympathetic chamber piece.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
It's pretty basic boilerplate, scary-movie stuff, with tropes and tricks that have already been extensively satirised elsewhere.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
Franco proves adept at directing but his screenplay (co-written with mumblecore king Joe Swanberg) is a wash.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
The Rental could have been a lean, mean horror film that took after any one of the thrillers it seems desperate to imitate and subvert. It's a shame it ended up just being dull.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
Good thrillers cause you to rethink everyday normalcies as potential dangers, and the plausibility of the situation here is effective.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
Those who savour a gradual build up and characters who feel like real people, however flawed they are, The Rental should prove a satisfying destination.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
""The Rental"" effectively reminds us that we need not going looking for monsters; they're often standing right next to us or gazing out of the mirror.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
Proves to be one of the most exhilarating debuts to date in the horror-thriller genre.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
A well performed psychological thriller that smoothly shifts gears into horror territory with swift and scary precision.
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
What makes this movie stand out is that its main characters are their own real villains. A very effective thriller adapted to the modern era of renting vacation houses. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Rental,75,45,critic,"
Right up to the last 30 minutes this really is your run of the mill secrets-turned-killer-thriller, but when it switches gears to horror, it's a relentless slide to the finish.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,audience,"Faith Based is part parody and part mockumentary and mostly unfunny.  There are some notable cameos and a germ of an idea, but overall the jokes fall flatter than a plate full of pee.  The filmmakers are quite self aware which would work if the movie didn't wander between genres like a bull in a museum.  A rather large fail.  Final Score: 4/10"
Faith Based,94,79,audience,Hilarious and entertaining! A great feel good comedy to watch over and over. Great movie - go check it out!
Faith Based,94,79,audience,"A really enjoyable, feel-good buddy film. It will have you laughing out loud as it makes fun of the Christian film genre and maybe even questioning your own life choices."
Faith Based,94,79,audience,"Buddy comedies aren't supposed to make you think but Faith Based is more nuanced than most. By pulling punches when it could have hit harder, we get a smart, endearing comedy that feels as if Sofia Coppola collaborated with Will Ferrell after watching ""Saved"" and Cheech and Chong. Want a brighter, less dystopian ""Requiem for a Dream"" subplot, courtesy of Jason Alexander? That's just one of many aspects of this film that pulls you in. But you should stay for the blend of matter of fact comedy mixed with laugh out loud absurdity that drives a unique story."
Faith Based,94,79,audience,Solid indie movies that makes me think I could get into some god for money type scheme myself . I’d be lying if I didn’t say I thought this would be a tad better but none the less 3.3. Nikki steel stole the show
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
Occasionally hilarious...occasionally as clumsy as the film-within-a-film that the goofball main characters are creating.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
Luke Barnett and Tanner Thomason's spoof of a lucrative niche film industry is consistently amusing, admirably respectful, surprisingly heartfelt and occasionally laugh-out-loud.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
Faith Based ultimately proves to be a really charming, very smart and frequently funny ride with a unique satirical target and a sweet cast.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
'Faith Based' has an over-the-top, campy, docu-film feel that makes it a bit funnier than it probably should be.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
A very funny comedy that lands some solid punches.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
Faith Based is fair-minded and a lot of fun. It's a sincere effort that is anything but mean-spirited. A digestible, smile-inducing watch.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
Comedy starts strong but fizzles out; pot use, swearing.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
The movie, while it maintains an edge, really doesn't have a mean bone in its cinematic body. I love the way the friendship is depicted with realistic dialogue and great chemistry between the two leads.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
It is clever without being glib and never condescends even as it is making fun...In an entertainment world packed with options, you might not feel like taking a chance. But sometimes, well ... you might want to have a little faith.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
I love the initial cynicism of this sendup of Christian cinema, and love even more how it goes on to punch up rather than down, and embraces sincerity and friendship with good cheer and gentle zing.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
This independent comedy proves surprisingly smart as the script by Luke Barnett skewers religious movies, their marketing and the audiences that flock to them.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
Is ""Faith Based"" the answer to the prayers of comedy-starved movie buffs? Not entirely, but it's no plague of locusts, either.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
It pokes fun at Christian films while also telling a character-based story and taking the issue of belief quite seriously.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
The title may make it seem like the movie is going to be constant jokes about faith based films. There is some of that, but the story explores much more.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
Pity, or prayer, couldn't change the fact that ""Faith Ba$ed"" is abysmally unfunny.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
Hilariously pokes fun at Christian cinema without being cruel.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
The dynamic duo of Luke Barnett and Tanner Thomason carry ""Faith Ba$ed"" as a buddy-movie-leaving the making of a 'Christian based film' as a minor subplot.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
This satirical comedy takes aim at those who take advantage of the faithful in a story that contains shades of the religious exploration of Dogma (1999) and the spunky underdog filmmaking of Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008).
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
The script is solid and the chemistry between Barnett and Thompson works.
 "
Faith Based,94,79,critic,"
A surprisingly affectionate and compassionate tale of bum-luck charisma, uphill determination and lasting friendship.

Greyhound,78,75,audience,"Talking about forgettable films...

Man, I feel Tom Hanks has been playing the same character over and over for the past 20 years. There are no surprises, anything new here. He's the ""American hero"" of the movie. 

Definitely would've enjoyed this one more in a movie theater. I found it to be entertaining at a certain point, but at times it feels like a Battleship game. Those last 15 minutes are the ones that make this film worth a watch."
Greyhound,78,75,audience,"I like it actually somewhat better than three stars' worth but only because I am a naval history nerd. Movie-wise, plot-wise, character-wise, there is really too little here to justify calling it a movie. And as a naval history nerd, several ahistorical goofs as well as the plain stupid jingoist depiction of German U-boat sailors (my uncle was one) was offputting."
Greyhound,78,75,audience,A great adaptation of C.S. Forrester's book.  Hanks is brilliant.  The tactical scenes where the captain has to decide which ships to defend and how are stunning.
Greyhound,78,75,audience,"Really good movie to highlight The Battle of the Atlantic. Thoroughly enjoyed the film throughout. The battle scenes were brilliant and CGI was on point all the way through the movie. 

However, I thought the few scenes with the Capitans girlfriend/wife weren't majorly necessary."
Greyhound,78,75,audience,"Great War movie and very accurate technically and action wise. But no emotionally connection with any of the characters, needed more balance, all intense action. Mostly TOM Hanks barking orders and hearing battle reports. Good historical account of the battle of the Atlantic. Most people don't understand how terrifying it really was."
Greyhound,78,75,audience,Great navy flick. Tom Hanks character isn't that memorable but the story was entertaining and the Action scenes were very suspenseful.
Greyhound,78,75,audience,Had my heart racing!
Greyhound,78,75,audience,"Good play by Tom Hanks as usual but the story is not very interesting, predictable. Not different from other similar older movies, nothing new..."
Greyhound,78,75,audience,Very well done. One of the all time best naval films.
Greyhound,78,75,audience,Too technical and too much jargon to follow at times.
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
Even though he didn't direct it, Greyhound feels like it was an absolute labor of love for Tom Hanks.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
It is a movie only about procedure.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
Hanks likes what he likes, and, in its best moments, Greyhound revels in its own obsessive attention to detail. It's too bad the enthusiasm isn't exactly infectious.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
With little character development on paper, the narrative finds victory through Hanks' patient physical performance and the craftsmanship within the battles.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
Greyhound is an example of how riveting World War II movies can still be over seven decades after the fighting ceased. And with Tom Hanks leading the way in every sense, you know you're in good hands.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
Tension takes hold in the first ten minutes and does not let go.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
Hanks's energy... keeps the plot afloat, and all the essential elements of a good war movie are present in moderation to satisfy moderate expectations. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
There is not much fat in Tom Hank's screenplay about an inexperienced U.S. Navy Captain trying to get a convoy safely past a German submarine wolfpack during World War II. The film's action scenes are intense, and very realistic-looking.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
Chronicling an often forgotten WWII naval battleground, Greyhound is a tense and gripping action drama impressively lead by Hanks.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
If this is all Tom Hanks imagines a Tom Hanks vehicle to be, he greatly underestimates himself.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
Director Aaron Schneider maintains an excellent sense of ""geography"" during the action sequences. Viewers know where the various ships and submarines are at all times ...
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
The depth Hanks brings to this almost eclipses the adventure, but mostly, Greyhound is a ripping yarn.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
Running a tight 91 minutes, ""Greyhound"" is a tense, nearly non-stop actioner.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
The star is the military machinery -- playing the world's deadliest game of hide and seek. With a running time just over 80 minutes...this is a good immersive experience, turn off the lights, turn up the sound and get lost in the chase.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
The performances here are good, as is the cinematography-close, but not claustrophobic. It's a movie of tactics, resolve, and a little bit of faith. Maybe 10 minutes too long, but who's counting.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
It is fascinating at the level of watching men execute their training, and deeply, soothingly boring at any other level whatsoever.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
A bit slighter than some of its contemporary war movies but Hanks covers over a multitude of sins, or, in this case, mediocrities.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
While spectacular visual effects, pulsating soundtrack and commanding performance by awards-fave Hanks are still appreciated at home, it's difficult to become fully engrossed here, particularly with sound & image taking precedence over storytelling.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
I love Hanks, but this is an example of a book that does not translate well to the screen.
 "
Greyhound,78,75,critic,"
There's a story waiting to happen here. It never happens.

My Spy,48,39,audience,"We loved  it ! So funny . We were so surprised by rotten tomatoe score , maybe one time they got it wrong !! Define toy worth your time and endorfins!"
My Spy,48,39,audience,Rating: 6/10. 68/100
My Spy,48,39,audience,My spy is a decent family film that should entertain families but don’t expect anything very memorable. The lead actress does a good job in the movie has a couple of funny jokes although some of the jokes to seem out of place for a family film. It’s a cute movie it’s pretty fast paced but it’s predictable and there’s really nothing here you haven’t seen in other spy comedies. It’s watchable but instantly forgettable.
My Spy,48,39,audience,"It was adorable, never down play Bautista, love his humble demeanor, Sophie is spot on with her ""today's"" Macaulay! A fun, light hearted CIA spin with a curve of where we all long to be! Happy, even for a moment in time. Loved it!"
My Spy,48,39,audience,It was fun watching this. Batista did some good acting though
My Spy,48,39,audience,"My children love this, so what if all of these critics rank it low, bunch of stuck up childless prudes. Honestly if you want to sit with the family, laugh and see the good guys win then watch it. I think we have seen this maybe 20 times now, including in the theatre on initial release and frankly in this messed up world today everyone could use a good laugh from a feel good movie!"
My Spy,48,39,audience,What did you expect with a director that has nothing but movies that flop.
My Spy,48,39,audience,"Excellent feel good fun.  No Oscars here, but the fun and feel good vibes aplenty!"
My Spy,48,39,audience,My Spy should not be considered a family friendly film and children defiantly don't need to view the content of this movie. Lousy job in writing by Jon & Erick Hoeber. Could have been a much better film especially with 7 producers. They really dropped the standard for an action film with the addition of characters Todd & Carlos.
My Spy,48,39,audience,"For anyone who loved ""Johnny English"" or ""Get Smart"" this will be more than worth a watch. Although at some point the spy-storyline and the action go too far, the situational comedy is very well done and makes this action comedy into a fun film, instead of a whacky action movie."
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
Owes a debt to the other tough guy babysitting movies that came before it but succeeds through personality over predictability.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
Screenwriting brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber deliver a comedy that is predominantly two things: predictable, yet charming.

My Spy,48,39,critic,"
Parents will enjoy a visually compelling proposition, remarkable performances, and an entertaining and purposeful spy plot. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
Charmless, unfunny, and... What film were we talking about?
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
An entertaining way to kill 100 minutes, thanks to a nice sense of self-awareness from its cast and a winning pair in its combination of a giant star and pint-sized side-kick.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
There are elements to like within the film, and charming moments will work for younger viewers... The dialogue will completely take anyone else out of the movie.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
When I say you've seen every gag, I mean the closest thing to a fun moment is a slapstick bit that's literally stolen almost beat for beat from True Lies.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
Though My Spy is surprisingly funny at points, the whole experience feels a bit undercooked.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
A dumb action movie can be entertaining if there's plenty of action. My Spy falls very short of that expectation, as the movie's pace gets dragged down when the main character starts dating a single mom and starts acting like a domesticated stepfather.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
This territory has been explored many times before, but ""My Spy"" is an inoffensive time waster.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
Family friendly comedy that I'd actually like to see a sequel in the works.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
""I love this movie. Tons of fun. Dave Bautista and Chloe Coleman form a great duo that was unexpected in a hilarious way ""
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
I love Dave Bautista, but man this just went to the well for every single one of those clichés.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
Both a little bit better than I expected and not quite good... Self-awareness doesn't make up for the fact that it's very predictable.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
Dave Bautista gets outsmarted by a child in an action-comedy that doesn't reinvent the wheel but delivers some cracking gags that will leave you smiling.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
The chemistry between the leads, and focus on a young girl dealing with social issues at school, bolsters what otherwise would be a pat comedy.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
It all just seems so tired.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
Three terrific lead performances and sharp dialogue elevate a well-worn premise.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
... the result is a movie that may distract uncritical younger viewers, but is not very good.
 "
My Spy,48,39,critic,"
This family comedy featuring former WWE superstar Dave Bautista is the perfect bit of summer escapism -- light and breezy fun that exceeded my rather low expectations.

The Outpost,93,82,audience,Very good movie. Nice story from combat and from personal perspective.
The Outpost,93,82,audience,The Outpost beats many classics with its flawless climax making you freeze in your seat for 45 minutes straight.
The Outpost,93,82,audience,"A hard to watch movie, but absolutely compelling. I felt privileged to watch the retelling of this horrific battle by these brave soldiers. Too often we take our freedom for granted, until we watch something like The Outpost."
The Outpost,93,82,audience,"Super good. One of the better war movies I've ever seen. Very emotionally meaningful, and very well executed!!"
The Outpost,93,82,audience,"Best war film since ""Blackhawk Down!"" Outstanding!"
The Outpost,93,82,audience,"The execution and delivery of this movie is authentic, and filled with realism, and as a former U.S. Army soldier who served in Desert Storm, Haiti, Rwanda and other operations, this movie is one of the top movies in this genre ever made. Why? Besides being based on a true story, everything from the weapons to radios are correctly portrayed. From a cinematic perspective, the use of ""long shots"" are amazing, especially the ""bridge"" scene. Well done!! Ten stars, not five!!"
The Outpost,93,82,audience,"This is a very difficult movie to watch, but a must see for every American."
The Outpost,93,82,audience,"I saw the documentary and this was pretty similar to what actually happened, but the acting could be subpar at times it was still a great movie."
The Outpost,93,82,audience,"I am not American, nor have I ever experienced the tragedy and triumph of war first hand, but man, Caleb Landry Jones sure acted his heart out, and it was fantastic. A lot of gun shooting, explosions, cursing, and etc. But I'm sure that there was a lot of that considering the circumstances of the story they are telling. Scott Eastwood was there. It was pretty good and definitely worth a watch."
The Outpost,93,82,audience,"An incredible movie.  From the way it was filmed, to the action and even the acting for an action film was impressive. Most action films use a ton of quick editing to make the action seem intense but this film uses long shots to make you film like you are there and in it.  I would put this up there with platoon."
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
As a stark comment on the cost of war it is a powerful and award worthy effort.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
The Outpost is the visceral, often-gripping experience Lurie designed it to be.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
The Outpost honors this particular group of soldiers while still recognizing the pointlessness of their mission. There's no entertainment value in its brutality, but it's still a worthy addition to the war film canon.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
It's a true-life story, masterfully directed by Rod Lurie who instinctively captures the danger, risks and moments of desperation and humanity of the event.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
... an unsparing look at the frustrations of fighting against hundreds of invisible enemies armed to their teeth.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
When the action comes, as it frequently does, it is viscerally effective, conveying the fight between internal discipline and external chaos.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
The Outpost is crafted with precision, expertise and experience. It's a war drama that transports you to the battlefield in all its cinematic brilliance.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
I think this beautifully depicts the uncertainty of combat and the moments before and after, too.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
The Outpost is a cleverly, and respectfully, crafted war film that uses a segmented, episodic approach to help you invest in the characters while building up to a very impressive battle sequence.

 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
The effective drama The Outpost recreates the Afghanistan War's Battle of Kamdesh ... in such brutal and realistic detail, that some viewers watching it might feel as if they've gone through an emotional war zone just by seeing this movie.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
Stylish without relying on over-stylization with a sense of pace and aesthetic informed more by a middle-ground between real field footage and first-person-shooter energy than yet another attempt to outgun ""Black Hawk Down.""
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
It's a stirring tribute, and a reminder that war movies may be born in Hollywood, but they are conceived on the battlefield.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
This is a very realistic-looking movie about a harrowing battle, and it is also a thoughtful depiction of a war that puts soldiers at risk for what seems to be increasingly hard to justify reasons.
 "
The Outpost,93,82,critic,"
More than qualifies as one of the most important war films of the past decade.

Hamilton,98,90,audience,"It's not quite the same as being there obviously, and would benefit from an actual cinematic adaptation, but this is a marvelously done stage play. The originality in the storytelling is inspiring. It also features some of the best hip-hop-inspired music to come out of a musical."
Hamilton,98,90,audience,The best hip-hop musical ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hamilton,98,90,audience,"So I myself have never seen a play on Broadway yet. I watched this play though. This rating is for the play itself and how it's presented on Disney+. On Disney+, the play is shown masterfully. The play is so good, it is the play we need right now because it is very feel good. I love how it has a main song throughout, yet uses other songs. It historical portrayals make interesting with all of the singing. This does not have alot of talking in it but alot of singing which is good these days. Costume design is great. The performances are so real. So, Hamilton basically lets off beautiful sparks."
Hamilton,98,90,audience,"This movie version is so well-shot, and the musical itself is fantastic. I don't really like musicals, but this is so catchy and captivating. Plus, history is always interesting."
Hamilton,98,90,audience,"This is a must-watch. I am not normally a fan of musicals, but this one, especially near the end, really worked for me. The diverse cast and the way they justify it (for a story about the founding fathers, who were all white) in a unique and meaningful way really highlights the beauty of America. I'm also glad to have learned about Alexander Hamilton, which this movie/show gave me a whole new perspective of. I won't lie, I almost cried at the end. Even if you hate musicals, at least try to check this out."

Hamilton,98,90,audience,This was the first time I watched this film and it was phenomenal!! I loved all the musical numbers (or most of them). And the acting was great! I recommend this movie strongly.
Hamilton,98,90,audience,The movie was disorienting and unintelligible 
Hamilton,98,90,audience,"Incluso si lo que muestran no logra interesarme lo suficiente para verla una segunda ves, resulta ser una película muy bien dirigida, con un manejo increíble en las luces, y aunque a veces la historia resulta difícil de seguir el hilo, no quiere decir que no tenga mucho merito"

Musical theater par excellence.

Hamilton,98,90,critic,"
This almost goes without saying because it is so unsurprising: This cinematic representation of Hamilton is, like the work itself, absolutely terrific.
 "
Hamilton,98,90,critic,"
Telling the story of America then with a diverse cast representing America now, [Hamilton] really transports you with its incredible visuals and performances.

Miranda's daring, genre busting show speaks for itself, often with beautiful tongue-twisting wordplay, and doesn't need flashy cinematic theatrics to bolster what is already a provocative and timely story of creating a union where none existed.

Hamilton,98,90,critic,"
This taping does a remarkable job showcasing the play in a new way-even if you've already seen it on stage.

On film, Hamilton feels every bit as fresh, invigorating, intoxicating, and revolutionary as it did when it premiered five years ago.

Historical weightiness aside, Hamilton is simply fun.

It's fantastic to have a filmed version that gets as close to putting us ""in the room where it happens"" as it's possible to get.
 "
Hamilton,98,90,critic,"
The show, against all odds, lives up to its hype.
 "
Hamilton,98,90,critic,"
This is a stage show with cameras capturing the action, and while I appreciated seeing it, I felt like there were missed opportunities to editorialize a little more and draw deeper visual connections than what the proscenium of a stage could provide.

Hamilton,98,90,critic,"
Do not throw away your shot at watching Hamilton's original cast both make and recreate history. 'Satisfied'? You will be.
 "
Hamilton,98,90,critic,"
This two and a half hour movie covers a lot of events that happen over a period of many years, but it manages to do all this at a very lively pace. The songs, both rap and more traditional theatrical songs are well-written and performed.
 "
Hamilton,98,90,critic,"
Even without the magic only a live performance can illicit, this is an astounding piece of theatrical art that is now more accessible than ever.
 "

Miranda's hip-hop tracks took on a new life on film, bolstered by camera movement, cutaways, and close-ups that aren't possible for a stage production. This helps Jonathan Groff's spit-spewing King George III the most.

Miss Juneteenth,99,57,audience,Ending is disappointingly ridiculous and it's a tad uneven but I really appreciated the authentic feeling of a place and culture.
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,audience,"Overall, this is a touching drama film.  It is filled with fantastic and pleasing performances from both Nicole Beharie and Alexis Chikaeze.  The plot is also satisfying as we witness a mother only wanting the best for her child and the struggles of her trying to do so.  The pacing for the most part is pleasing, but the film certainly feels quite slow to begin with.  Thankfully, it picks up at a nice pace for the second and third act.  Some key moments were also predictable for me, which could differ to others - Walkden Entertainment"
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,audience,"Miss Juneteenth doesn't waste a single moment of its oustanding narrative, - that, despite depicting old familiar themes, does so with a highly nuanced effort from writer-director Channing Godfrey Peoples - offering a talented ensemble, led by a strong turn from Nicole Beharie, enough material to convey a powerful message."
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,audience,it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,audience,"Miss Juneteenth is a powerful film that follows the life of a former Miss Juneteenth in Fort Worth and how all her hopes and dreams rest with her 14 year old daughter becoming the next Miss Juneteenth. Filmed primarily in east Fort Worth and in the Woman's Club, you'll recognize the downtown skyline, Baker's Funeral Home, and maybe the Lucky Mini Mart. Written and directed by Channing Godfrey Peoples, the daughter of local racial justice activist and Tarrant County Democratic Party leader Deborah Peoples. It includes music by local composer and my next door neighbor, Curtis Heath . Nicole Beharie plays Turquoise Jones who struggles financially and is raising her daughter, Kai, as a single mom. Her husband has done time in jail and is generally not reliable as a dad or husband. Turq works in local black owned Wayman's bbq/beer joint and must pull extra shifts to pay for Kai's dress for the Miss Juneteenth pageant. She wants to give Kai a leg up in life but can't ever seem to get ahead financially. Wayman, played by Marcus M. Mauldin, gives a powerful speech about owning his own business and not having to go to the white man for help. Just so proud to have this important film made right here in the city I live. Buy it NOW on Amazon Prime or iTunes and support locally made films made by, starring, and about black lives! I give it 5 out of 5 stars! -El Duderino MacFarlane 🖤✨"
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,audience,quaint and touching but the plot is so standard there is not much too this.
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,audience,Miss Juneteenth is very sweet in the mother-daughter relationship at its core. They are the film's heart and all of those scenes were wonderful. The ending is also daring and different. The problem here is that all the other characters weren't well realized and the sections starring them certainly did grind the film to a halt.
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,audience,"Socially insightful and still a light-on-its-feet drama, ‘Miss Juneteenth' delivers more layered conflicts than another recent (and still likable) film about a pageant mom at odds with her daughter, ‘Dumplin'. Nicole Beharie stars as Turquoise, a young, steadfast single mother trying to empower her teenage daughter while navigating her own derailed destiny.

It's not particularly creatively shot, but it is engaging from start to finish, and debut writer/director Channing Godfrey Peoples gently weaves sobering racial history into the small-town Texas setting and Turquoise's own journey. Beharie refreshingly avoids flashiness and melodramatic peaks and her performance is all the more resonant for it. You will not only feel, but truly understand her pride, her regret, her resolve, her hope, her diplomacy, all the plates she is constantly re-stacking as she tries to position her daughter for success in life.

Peoples has crafted a prudent film if not a tremendous one."
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,audience,"This ""little"" slice of life movie is just wonderful.  The struggles and past and the present of this mother determined to make her teenage daughter become this year Miss Junetennth as she was was is the focus of the movie. Other issues are employement, men, poverty, and family.  This is a must see.  (How does this movie have a viewer rating of 59%?)"
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,audience,"Genuinely sweet, family drama that shows the resiliency of the bond between mother and daughter."
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,critic,"
One of the dynamic relationships to navigate is that of a Mother and Daughter. It is a bond like no other. Miss Juneteenth examines that bond intelligently and with raw honesty.
 "
Miss Juneteenth,99,57,critic,"
All of the acting is of a high calibre, with Beharie the standout, bringing Turquoise to life not only in the moment but also in the context of her past experiences.

Carl Jung's claim that the greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of its parents is rigorously tested, and validated, by this perfectly formed heartbreaker from the debut director Channing Godfrey Peoples.

When Miss Juneteenth isn't trafficking in tropes, it's a history lesson, and not the entertaining kind where you forget you're actually learning; the textbook kind.

The Short History of the Long Road,91,85,audience,Not the most ground breaking coming of age story out there but the performances from Sabrina Carpenter and Steven Ogg keep you emotionally invested throughout. The moral of the story gets a bit heavy handed and predictable towards the end but the journey getting there is worth the trip.

Lyrical and melancholy and visually stunning...

Throughout, writer-director Ani Simon-Kennedy keeps The Short History of the Long Road in gear - but a lower, slower one than you might expect.
 "
The Short History of the Long Road,91,85,critic,"
The Short History of the Long Road is a more contemplative coming-of-age drama than most, but despite its frequently weighty subject matter, it never drags or becomes oppressively dark.

Although it rambles like the endless roadways it follows, ""The Short History of the Long Road"" is a perceptive low-key character study.

...a lovely movie filled with disarming, soft-pedal performances in-keeping with the narrative's laid back vibe.

A standout performance from Sabrina Carpenter is the highlight of this very predictable story. The lack to attention given to the actual story is surprising in this otherwise fine coming of age story.

How to Build a Girl,79,57,audience,"Super cute, I really liked it!"
How to Build a Girl,79,57,audience,"I was so looking forward to seeing this but was so disappointed. The titles say ‘based on a true(ish) story', and that's the problem – it just wasn't a very interesting story."
How to Build a Girl,79,57,audience,"I think what I liked most about it is the concept.  It feels like Beanie Feldstein's Ladybird variation. 
Other than that, it feels a tad fast paced. I would have loved to see more of an exploration of her family life and her relations with the people around her. Still, the flurry of acquaintances and thoughts that she goes through is definitely more in line with what a 16 year old girl would be thinking. I like that she goes through a series of highs and lows, it manages to really present that point that she's trying to make about reinventing one's self over and over. 
In the end, it's a pleasant watch with the occasional fizziness, but I wouldn't call it memorable (unlike the protagonist's look which is absolutely so)."
How to Build a Girl,79,57,audience,Excentric and absolutely fabulous.
How to Build a Girl,79,57,audience,"a somewhat irrelevant comedy, characters without charisma but fun in their ways, boring and boring script that is even shameful."
How to Build a Girl,79,57,audience,Terrible well not terrible terrible but man their was a lot of cringey moments and I enjoy the main girl who was in book smart but this movie doesn't have the perfect writing that booksmart has.

How to Build a Girl,79,57,audience,"Out of 5 starts, I guess I would call it straight down the middle (2.5). Decent movie and good cast. Script and story feel a bit forced, but ultimately a good message and a film I might recommend to the right person."
How to Build a Girl,79,57,audience,"Worth watching simply because of the performance by Beanie Fieldstein in this semi-autobiographic tale from Caitlin Moran. She plays Johanna, a young girl growing up in the 1990s who dreams of leaving behind her drab, Wolverhampton life and becoming a writer. It is a charming story with plenty of giggles as Johanna's geeky, romantic personality morphs into a monstrous rock journalist persona in pursuit of fame and fortune due to the manipulations and sexism of the field. It is a gentle, coming of age type movie and the lessons that Johanna learns are well trodden enough that the plot hold no real surprises. The story could have gone even bigger and darker for my tastes but it certainly passed an amusing couple of hours and it's great to see a movie about growing up in the midlands for a change."
How to Build a Girl,79,57,audience,"I don't understand some of the negative reviews. I feel like some people are trying to achieve exacltly what Johanna Morrigan (Beanie Feldstein) did in the movie - to receive The Asshole of the Year Award! 
This movie is genuinely one of the most positive movies I've seen this year. It's a fun, rock'n'roll, coming of age and yet innocent story, because of the mains character's creative nature. Through her eyes, we can see the world without boundaries, no matter where you started in life, as long as you have the drive. Yes, she makes mistakes, but she also learns from them.
Some people say they were confused by the plot - but there is literally nothing to be confused about, well...  unless you are an asshole - In that case, you probably won't."

That sense of goodwill around television veteran Coky Giedroyc's comedy is certain to apply to even the most hard-hearted viewer.

There's not enough here to register as more than occasionally diverting, and so How to Build a Girl ends up falling apart.

Feldstein makes this into so much more than your average coming of age story. Her ability to capture a certain British working class sensibility won't be lost on anyone.
 "
How to Build a Girl,79,57,critic,"
How to Build a Girl is a sweet and winning adaptation of Caitlin Moran's semi-autobiographical novel, anchored by an endearing and charismatic performance from Beanie Feldstein who is quickly become a poster child for the coming-of-age genre.
 "
How to Build a Girl,79,57,critic,"
A funny and touching coming-of-age story that occasionally loses its way, just like its protagonist.

Fans of the book will undoubtedly find joy in seeing Johanna brought to life in this colorful and fun adaptation, and Feldstein continues to cement herself as a fantastic comedic actress.
 "
How to Build a Girl,79,57,critic,"
Moran's script is sharp on the particular dishonesty of 1990s sexism, glossed as it was with a wipe-clean coating of irony, and Feldstein makes an ebullient ringmaster.
 "
How to Build a Girl,79,57,critic,"
Feldstein is charming, but if the most impressive thing about Moran has always been her grasp of branding and sheer professional momentum, it gets lost in translation into the cartoonish Johanna.

Inside the Rain,86,65,audience,"A very unique and quirky romance comedy. I thought it was really well done, especially considering the budget was less than $1 million. And I could watch Ellen Toland for hours. She's a natural beauty and comes across as authentic and endearing. I think she has a bright future after this."
Inside the Rain,86,65,audience,Just watched this last night.  I applaud the director for having the courage to make this movie.  It is important to end the stigma of those with mental illness.  Thank you.
Inside the Rain,86,65,audience,This is a must see movie. I really loved it! It's interesting how bipolar is portrayed in this film and it felt very authentic. But also the love story is amazing and the love interest being a sex worker was very interesting and also felt very authentic.
Inside the Rain,86,65,audience,"Wow, this movie swept me away.  I have a daughter who is bipolar and this film gave me a lot of insight.   I also found it entertaining and enjoyable.  5 enthusiastic stars."
Inside the Rain,86,65,audience,"This movie was very funny and moving, too.  It is an unusual mix of comedy and drama that feels very authentic, as the writer-director-star has bipolar disorder in real life."
Inside the Rain,86,65,audience,"Quirky, quite a bit bizarre. But yeah. Good. Excellent soundtrack and a guy in his mid to late 30's pretending to be barely in college. Weird in all the right ways."
Inside the Rain,86,65,audience,"Funny and poignant.  I really enjoyed it, but also found it very helpful to understand what it is like for someone with bipolar.  Felt very authentic.  This is a must see movie."
Inside the Rain,86,65,audience,One of the best comedies I've seen this year!
Inside the Rain,86,65,audience,"This is such a brave and important, entertaining, and FUNNY movie! Rosie Perez is a national treasure and Eric Roberts is hilarious as the movie producer in his mom's garage. The film also deals with mental health challenges and a sex worker in ways I haven't seen EVER BEFORE in a film."
Inside the Rain,86,65,audience,This is a different type of romance movie I liked it . We got a kid with a full arsenal of mental issues who has problems connecting with basically anyone until he sticks up for a stripper outside of the club . I like the chemistry between them however this definitely wouldn’t qualify as a comedy in my books. Ben is a really hateable guy doesn’t deserve to even be able to hang out with that angel he yelled at 2.2. I never change rating but after further thought I moved this from a 2.7 to a 2.2
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
In the end, Inside the Rain mostly succeeds thanks to its empathetic message for those who struggle with mental health and of course, Rosie Perez.
 "
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
Inside the Rain can't help but be a brave piece of filmmaking. But you might not expect it to be as funny as it is. And above all, you may well be caught off-guard by its frequent moments of visual beauty.

Director/screenwriter/actor Aaron Fisher has bipolar disorder himself so Inside the Rain is loosely based on his own experiences when he was in his twenties.
 "
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
This movie is an off-beat romantic comedy focusing on a bi-polar young man who can't get out of his own way. Although engaging, sometimes, Writer/Director Aaron Fisher's script can't get out of its own way.
 "
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
Fisher's feature debut has a big, goofy heart that you can't help but enjoy.
 "
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
While some who share his struggles may be happy to see Fisher telling his own story here, very little in the self-portrait rings true.
 "
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
Aaron Fisher's semi-autobiographical dramedy about a manic depressive film student gracefully maneuvers through a fair share of mood swings.
 "
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
A film about mental health issues needs a good script and a first-rate cast to sustain a viewer's interest, and this one has neither.
 "
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
Sex, swearing, suicide, sympathy in bipolar romcom.
 "
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
""Inside the Rain"" switches erratically between comedy and drama while juggling many half-realized plot threads. But the movie's strange, inconsistent rhythm ultimately works as a reflection of Ben's manic and depressive states.
 "
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
Pleasant without being too fussy about it.
 "
Inside the Rain,86,65,critic,"
At its core is a big dorky heart not unlike its protagonist. Where the bark is worse than the bite and the affections run deeper than the volatile showings of animosity.

Fatal Affair,20,14,audience,"My garbage needs to be taken out. Wait, the stink was just this movie. Wooden acting, cheap attempts to gain intrigue with sex scenes, a guy who is a hacker (in words) but we never see him do it. He doesn't reveal this until late in the film when you already don't care. Feels like watching a daytime movie in the Drs waiting room and you can't change the channel. I played on my phone a lot."
Fatal Affair,20,14,audience,predictably derivative
Fatal Affair,20,14,audience,"Looks cheap, with a poor script, predictable."
Fatal Affair,20,14,audience,"Some people can't take a hint.  So this is about a successful lawyer (Nia Long).  She is on the verge of starting her own practice when she crosses paths with a man she used to know in high school (Omar Epps).  They catch up over drinks, and things escalate a bit too quickly, especially when you consider the fact that she is married.  She tries to brush it off, but he is not one that will give up easily.  Now I put this on for one reason and one reason alone: I was in the mood for something to laugh at, and Fatal Affair appeared to fit the bill.  I had heard stories of just how ridiculous this got, so I geared up for a fun ride.  Fatal Affair wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, but that isn't to say that I didn't get my fair share of entertainment out of this.  Now, if you couldn't figure out what this film is going for, let me spell it out for you: this is the black version of Fatal Attraction.  It is the same basic plot with the genders in reverse, and when you name your movie so blatantly, people's brains are going to leap to it automatically if they are at all versed in cinema.  It is advertising without having to pay for it, and it would be a successful trick if they put any smarts into the crafting of this movie.  I was hoping this would be something that was like The Intruder, and that's what this would have been in a best-case scenario.  This movie doesn't have that sense of self-awareness that made The Intruder fun, and it comes off more as trashy in a negative way.  The acting in this is mostly wooden, and it all starts with Omar Epps.  His character is obsessive, but even from the start, you're supposed to buy into the fact that he is a charming guy.  That never happens.  His flirting is aggressive, and not only that, his game is weak.  You're supposed to believe that Nia Long's character would get tempted, but who in their right mind would be falling for corny lines when there are red flags all over the place?  If this was a bit more over the top, I could have awarded more enjoyability points.  I think everybody who chooses to watch this knows what they are signing up for, so that should be full permission for the filmmakers to go bonkers with it.  Instead, this movie has lulls within the craziness, and it's a detriment to making this memorable.  Fatal Affair does breach into the realm of comedy, and you will find some laughs here, but make no mistake about it: this is a bad movie."
Fatal Affair,20,14,audience,Basic an embarrassingly bad even for Netflix.
Fatal Affair,20,14,audience,"Fatal affair isn’t a poorly made film the acting is decent, about well, and it’s made professionally. It’s just the film does not have an original bone in his body. We’ve seen this set up so many times but the movie is still suspenseful in parts. Unfortunately the characters make one dumb decision after another. In other words it’s watchable but you’ve seen it many many times before."
Fatal Affair,20,14,audience,i mean where to even start.....this movie is so bad its hilarious

Fatal Affair keeps the nightmares on-screen, making at least some of the danger we're living with digestible and even enjoyable.

It's actually not that bad of a movie. There's just so many dumb decisions made, but it is fun to watch. This is the kind of movie I wish I had seen in theaters...
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Not bad enough to be hilarious-good, like The Room, if they had gone full-crazy...Epps is crazy but has very little acting range...
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Fatal Affair looks like it could have been made for Lifetime, but the movie ended up on Netflix because Netflix pays more ... but that doesn't guarantee that the quality of this type of 'woman in peril' movie is going to be any better.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Slickly produced, this dramatic thriller constructs its plot by numbers, like a half-hearted gender-flipped remake of Fatal Attraction.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
By the end, the hour-and-a-half-long runtime feels overly stretched...
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Fatal Affair is as derivative as its title suggests.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Though repetition dampens the chills, 'Fatal Affair' boasts a few thrills. Too many cuts to ocean waves. Yet acting almost this film saves.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Fatal Affair sticks to the shallow formula that we begrudgingly love while creating a thrilling film that still manages to subvert a few expectations.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
A lazy thriller that doesn't offer much. One of the weakest films this year. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Neither being remarkable or lousy enough to register an impression, Fatal Affair plays it by-the-numbers in a bland revival of the domestic thriller genre.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
You won't make a fatal - or even near-fatal - error if you stream it.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Even as the clichés unleashed are profuse, so are the reminders of how entertaining and refreshingly adult these scenarios can be with the right cast, such as the energies Nia Long and Omar Epps conjure.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Considering the mediocre director's resume, maybe it would've played better as a Christmas comedy.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
[Fatal Affair] revives the 80 and 90s stalker trope but without much success... Nothing to see here folks, but I really like Nia Long who elevates it somewhat.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
One of those movies you'll constantly find yourself yelling at the screen in disbelief. And there's plenty of eye-rolling moments of insanity here.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
As a lazy afternoon semi-thriller, though, it does exactly what it says on the tin.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Search the words ""Fatal"" and ""Affair"" and you'll find a lot of better movies that cover this territory.
 "
Fatal Affair,20,14,critic,"
Nia Long and Omar Epps give it a try but even they can't save Fatal Affair from its by-the-numbers formula approach to the thriller genre we have seen so many times before, and this one borders on parody. Long deserves much better.

Residue,93,54,audience,Beautifully shot in a depressing yet real and inviting setting. Gives a great point of view from the black perspective in the United States. It can be funny at times by how ridiculous and obvious the new white inhabitants are. It gives a good glimpse into black culture as it shows a regular story for many people when they go home.
Residue,93,54,audience,"I am a 3 generation native Washingtonian and let it be known any young brother from DC doing something good and positive has my support. But, I must admit DC is messed up if this is view from the cameras lens. Although this story is someone's life in DC, I was hoping for the more educational approach. We have many struggle movies out here and this one felt like another one. I guess I wanted more of a unified, rise above movie. I was definitely hoping to see some of our GoGo's best as more than a blurb or soundbite. All this may sound bad but, it isn't meant to be. I AM DC so I am very familiar with the many changes here but, I need a movie showing more of this good black life that actually is happening here. The director being a great example.

DC has some really good black talent and some good black stories to offer. I said somebody needs to jump on doing a Original Series on GoGo. Only way the gentrification will stop is if we buy it back. Continued success and blessings to everyone involved in this body of work.

AND....WATCH THE MOVIE STILL!!!!"
Residue,93,54,audience,"""Residue"" is a very good first film tackling an important theme, the gentrification of American cities. Highly recommend it to drama lovers."
Residue,93,54,audience,I didn't find this story interesting and it was too slow. The visual and sound quality were also terrible. There's no excuse for being this cheap-looking.
Residue,93,54,audience,"Completely unwatchable. I couldn't get past the first 5 minutes. The camera work is terrible, colour grading is terrible, sound is terrible. I had to turn it off, it was torture. Only because it's an independent film, doesn't mean the quality has to be that terrible. I've seen high-schoolers and Youtubers produce better work.  I can't recommend this trash to anyone. I'd rather watch a film made by a 5 year old. 
Get it together my black brother."
Residue,93,54,audience,"A phenomenal look at the residual effects that gentrification take, not only on those pushed away but the community at large. As a Maryland native whose lived in DC for many years, only to move to NY, this film hit home on several levels. Coming home to a place you don't recognize is a surreal experience and this film blends the bleak truth of home lost through an artful lens. Scenes mesh and collide like the city during rush hour and makes for an impactful and honest ride."
Residue,93,54,audience,"Sublime artistry. A work of beauty. Raw, immediate, intense and necessary. 

From the outset this film had an uneasy sense of familiarity, but the journey's direction and outcome remained unknown until the closing frame. Gripping.

An outstanding writer / director debut from Merawi Gerima."
Residue,93,54,critic,"
As Gerima peels back the layers of history and memory, past melds with present as does the imagined with the real.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
In Gerima's lens, the alienation of gentrification is rendered in almost impressionistic ways.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
Because this is a film that flows rather than catapults through its plot, the stuff that another movie would pull off too neatly here feels ephemeral and slippery. The textures Gerima generates are as rigorous as they are personal.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
Drama about impact of gentrification falls short; language.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
Merawi Gerima's directorial debut Residue is an impassioned ode to a rapidly gentrifying Washington D.C.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
Be it a person or a city, ""Residue"" is a kind of poetic depiction of what essentially constitutes a literal erasure of an identity to fit the desires of the affluent.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
It's a fiction, true, but a fiction that Gerima builds out of his own experience, as well as the experience of the people he grew up with in D.C., a semi-autobiographical work of astonishing vulnerability.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
Impressionistic filmmaking recounts an elusive personal story using a variety of artful photographic styles, edited together with eye-catching energy.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
For every lyrical sequence that mixes nostalgia and trauma with ease, there are countless moments that feel thrown together, underwritten and poorly produced.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
A righteously angry meditation on people, place and time, ""Residue"" marks not just an arresting directing debut for Gerima, but a blunt statement on contemporary culture.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
This is an effective, distinctive, and highly mature work of cinema. For a film in its own right it is hugely impressive. As a directorial debut, it really is a marvel.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
Jay maintains an affective proximity to his old home; close contact with family, old friends, and a former lover bring us closer to the aloof budding filmmaker, who can't seem to grasp how he has grown so estranged from his past life...
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
The film sings in its attempts to show the complex nature of one affected by the change of a place they are no longer a part of.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
An artful and piercing debut.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
...Residue is fiction, but the truth driving it is captivating.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
Gerima's challenging, engrossing filmmaking style is measured, simultaneously realistic and impressionistic.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
These issues persist. And Gerima explores new ways to dwell on them. If nothing else, the feelings he drums up in Residue linger.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
Merawi Gerima's debut makes a powerful impression.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
Residue frames how a place of beauty and family and friendship, one where people looked out for each other, has become strained, slowly being stripped apart.
 "
Residue,93,54,critic,"
Even when I found the stylistic choices irritating, I couldn't deny that they were intentionally deployed by a confident filmmaker in full control of his craft.
 "
A Violent Man,44,72,audience,"A really good and dramatic storyline that wants you to keep getting more of the story. You’ll feel bad with Ty Matthews as the struggles as he lives throughout the film, but there’s a shock, twist ending that I won’t spoil. You have to see it 7/10"
A Violent Man,44,72,audience,Thomas Jones is a very underated actor.  Was great in the Luke Cage series and it's great to see him in this movie that he also produced!
A Violent Man,44,72,audience,An intense movie that inherently addresses many current issues in society.  The screen play is powerful and provoking.
A Violent Man,44,72,critic,"
... the film is still a worthy installment in the neo-noir cannon, if only for its pursuit of a story that isn't styled after Harmony Korine's particular brand of ""chaos in paradise"" narratives in America's southeastern corridor.
 "
A Violent Man,44,72,critic,"
A thoughtful character-driven thriller is buried somewhere beneath the clichés that eventually overwhelm this uneven mixed-martial arts melodrama.
 "
A Violent Man,44,72,critic,"
Writer-director Matthew Berkowitz's crime drama ""A Violent Man"" has all the pungent cynicism of a classic film noir but lacks the urgency.
 "
A Violent Man,44,72,critic,"
A Violent Man is a good film with a good cast and story. Fans of film noir are going to appreciate the final product.
 "
A Violent Man,44,72,critic,"
Doesn't offer much to make it worth contender status.
 "
A Violent Man,44,72,critic,"
A Violent Man struggles to be a sports film and a thriller, stripping either of any sense of dramatic urgency.
 "
A Violent Man,44,72,critic,"
What seems, at first, to be an indie crime thriller reveals itself, upon conclusion, to be much deeper in its examination of not just a soul cast into purgatory, but of fate itself.
 "
A Violent Man,44,72,critic,"
An MMA fighter murder mystery that never makes much of the mystery.
 "
A Violent Man,44,72,critic,"
A thriller that punches above its weight. There are some twists and turns that I wasn't expecting; and to director Matthew Berkowitz's credit, it's a film that follows through on its promises to the very end.

This is a very moving film... You really become invested in these characters.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
A thoroughly engrossing tale of one young coach's attempt to grow boys into men via the discipline of competition grappling, and a blistering depiction of failing public high schools in America.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
Will these young men conquer in life as they sometimes do on the mat? We're not entirely sure, but we grow to like these kids and wish them well. That's a reflection of the involvement created by a good documentary.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
The film spends time getting to know each of the four young men, who despite the difficulties they face in their arduous climb to adulthood, are brimming with vitality.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
One reason ""Wrestle"" is so effective is that director Herbert and cinematographer Sinisa Kukic made the decision to move to Huntsville for the duration of the shoot.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
In its sobering conclusions, Wrestle has us question how much we undervalue poor children's lives, circumstances and education in this country.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
Like the best sports films, the sport itself is window dressing, window dressing drawing the eye into a fascinating rumination on race and class in modern day America.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
""Wrestle"" is a moving and haunting portrait of four young men fighting to win a golden ticket.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
... finds engaging subjects to paint a gritty and universal picture of contemporary adolescence and the value of athletics. The crowd-pleasing result leaves plenty to cheer about.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
Profiling four members of an underdog high-school wrestling team in Huntsville, Alabama, ""Wrestle"" constructs an empathetic portrait of a mat that's anything but level.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
Sometimes hopeful, other times heartbreaking, Wrestle is an honest portrait of disadvantaged American youth that will inspire empathy and leave viewers with lots to ponder.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
The documentary presents a world where sports may present an escape, all while the specter of poverty hangs over everything. It's absolutely engrossing.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
The documentary shines a piercing light on the sorts of people that our governments would too often rather forget.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
Formulaic but quite revealing coming-of-age-through-sport documentary.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
Though hardly the first movie of its kind, it feels more vital than many of its fellow descendants of Hoop Dreams, and reminds us there are more than a couple of sports offering pathways to a college degree.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
Wrestle will completely suck you in from beginning to end. It's is a heartbreaking, yet honest look at the more poverty-torn cities in our country.
 "
Wrestle,100,94,critic,"
This engrossing snapshot has a good shot at exposure beyond the festival circuit, with public television being a logical destination.

Honey Boy,94,92,audience,"Intense, raw, hard-hitting, beautiful, and daringly confrontational, Honey Boy is a fantastically-acted, deftly-written, caringly-directed autobiographical treatment of its subject's inner demons and troubled past, guiding the viewer along on an emotionally impactful and universally relatable journey through childhood hardships, love, and dreams."
Honey Boy,94,92,audience,"Pretty good semi-autobiographical movie starring and written by Shia LaBeouf.  Shia LaBeouf does a good with his character.  You definitely get some insight what it was like for him growing up.  It is hard to watch at times, but is a story that is ultimately about forgiveness."
Honey Boy,94,92,audience,"One of the most interesting films I've seen in a while, told from the perspective of someone I would never think to relate too. Noah Jupe and Lucas Hedges do a fantastic job, portraying the same character over time, as well as Labeouf's fictionalization of his own father. This script really brings ""write what you know"" to a whole other level."
Honey Boy,94,92,audience,"While the film covers many dark topics, it is not without heart, and its humour and peculiar charm keeps it from getting too dark. The most interesting aspect of the film is the fact that Shia Labeouf chooses to play his own father. This produces a profound amount of intimacy,  almost like the audience has a first row seat to a therapy session. The direction by Alma Har'el encourages this honest tone, and creates an almost dream-like feel, with bright colors, flashbacks/flashforwards, and establishing a hazy LA vibe. I also love how masterfully the film navigates the complex father and son dynamic of Otis and his father James. Otis, at the age of 12 supports his unemployed father, which begs the question, would his father still be there if Otis didn't pay him? Each scene between the two, dives deeper into their relationship, and it helps that most of these scenes take place in the cramped and claustrophobic motel room where they live, and can barely get any space from each other. One scene that was particularly heart wrenching, shows Otis pleading for his dad to be a better father, while James lies on the bed, his back turned. And while it is clear that James is no father of the year, the empathy at the core of the film manages to shine through, teaching the audience to cling to tender moments."
Honey Boy,94,92,audience,Where's the actual truth in this movie about the paedophilia ring in Hollywood?
Honey Boy,94,92,audience,This was darker than I expected.  Pretty painful but truthful in addressing the cycle of abuse and addiction. I hope Mr. Lebeouf found some healing while he worked through this. His portrayal of his father was bone crushing.
Honey Boy,94,92,audience,the story feels done before but remains relevant 
Honey Boy,94,92,audience,"Incredibly acted, intimate story reconciling what made you, meditative in the right kind of way that awoke past moments I'd long forgotten and provided a window forward through my past."
Honey Boy,94,92,audience,"A beautiful, slow punch in the gut."
Honey Boy,94,92,audience,"RATING: A+  Director: Alma Har'el
Honey Boy is one of the most Heartbreaking films I've seen so far. The Cast, Shia LaBeouf, Lucas Hedges and Noah Jupe, is really good and everyone gives an Outstanding Performance in their own way. Shia LaBeouf wrote the Screenplay as soon as he got out of Rehab and it really feels like a big healing process, which is good ( The Way Back is another example of such an ""On- Screen Therapy"" but in that case for Ben Affleck ). The Cinematography is really astonishing as well. Truly a Cinematic Experience. In other words Honey Boy will break your heart into pieces only to rebuild it stronger than it was before."

LaBeouf's performance is nothing short of outstanding as he puts himself in his own father's headspace in a truly heartbreaking effort to better understand him, as well as grapple with the traits that they share.

It's nothing short of a cinematic exorcism for one of Hollywood's most unusual figures.

Light and sensitive, Har'el's direction creates a cathartic experience. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Honey Boy,94,92,critic,"
Written as a therapy exercise by actor Shia LaBeouf, as a part of his rehabilitation program, Honey Boy is an autobiographical tale that has the queasy qualities of a Catholic confession.

A moving exploration of art, trauma and the connection between the two.

The movie feels very raw. LaBeouf's voice is very unfiltered through this movie... You can tell that he's working through things as he writes the movie.
 "
Honey Boy,94,92,critic,"
Honey Boy is a messy triumph for screenwriter LaBeouf and director Har'el.

Native Son,60,51,audience,"Ashton Sanders è un astro nascente, detta il ritmo e cattura la scena in questo film molto particolare che si adatta perfettamente al suo personaggio.
Piaccia o no, i ritmi lenti e cadenzati come le movente di Ashton, il film segue la parabola di un giovane afro americano, il cui destino è segnato da un singolo momento che fa crollare tutte le sue speranze, portandolo in una spirale di disperazione."
Native Son,60,51,audience,Native Son by Richard Wright is one of my favorite books. This film is not that book. It is a modernization with a different ending. Bigger is a Native Son. He is the product of systemic racism in America.
Native Son,60,51,audience,"I've been underwhelmed by Ashton Sanders in the past, but he did a great job in this indie film. Unfortunately the plot takes a bombastic turn after the halfway mark, and to me, ruins a strong first half."
Native Son,60,51,audience,"Coolest jacket ever. Ashton Sanders was my favorite ""3rd"" of Moonlight. But the film had a completely different tone from the book (which I discuss here) because of the deviation from the book's setting — modern day vs. 1930s — especially during the final act. The film's Bigger is more likable, which is the problem."
Native Son,60,51,audience,Plane ride home from Spain
Native Son,60,51,audience,Rich white saviour movie
Native Son,60,51,audience,"Native Son is a good example of a worthy film, but one that sadly never gains true momentum. Based on the classic 1930s novel by Richard Wright the film is updated to modern times. Set in Chicago it deals with a young man named Bigger Thomas. Bigger is a free thinker and has a strong voice, but is also a little lost. When a job comes up to drive for a wealthy white family he takes it earn some much needed cash. The film has important things to say about race and class but it runs out of steam in the second half. Especially when events turn hairy they just seem rather improbable. Ashton Sanders is great though in the lead role. Worth a watch but it's a film that could have been so much more."
Native Son,60,51,audience,The update to modern times makes the whole exercise unpleasant in the extreme.
Native Son,60,51,audience,"A tense vision into the life of BIG, a young black man on the verge of self-awakening in Chicago. Will taking a driver job with the Dalton family, an affluent white clan living an Old World existence in a super privileged white enclave studded with mansions? Yes. And he fears he's becoming a House Boy shoveling coal in the heater located in the dungeon-like basement. We have access to BIG's interior world through VO and this adds great dimension to this sleeper of a film. However, the tension ratcheted up by the killing seems forced and I guessed the ending almost immediately. Overall though a fine flick and worthy of your viewing. "
Native Son,60,51,audience,"Despite a promising start, this movie falls flat on its face half way through. This movie would’ve been 10x’s better if it was to take place in the 1930’s like in the original novel. Bringing it to present day was a reach."
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
At times quite visually stunning, but with tonal incongruities that make for a disjointed viewing experience.

Native Son,60,51,critic,"
There are many things that make Park's work remarkable...
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Nearly 80 years after Native Son was first published, we're still searching for answers.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
The fact that we cannot escape Bigger Thomas's ghost is partly due to Johnson and Park's fashionable decision to subvert Wright's cautionary book and turn out one more urban-tragedy scenario, now carrying the imprimatur of HBO slickness.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Ashton Sanders gives a strong performance as Bigger.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Despite a promising start, I didn't believe a second of Native Son's second half.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Native Son is a compelling film with strong performances but I can't help but feel that something is lost in updating the story for present day.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Native Son makes a number of changes to its source material, many of which dilute the story's power.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Thanks in great part to the staying power of the source material, and the blistering work by Ashton Sanders and KiKi Layne, Native Son leaves a lasting imprint.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Native Son is heartbreaking and painfully relevant, proving that in the nearly 80 years since Wright published his novel, little has changed.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
The movie is at once struggling with what it wants to say, what it needs to say and what history has said before it, and its message becomes muddled in the process.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Native Son is a highly watchable and frequently discomfiting film in which the violence of one generation melts smoothly and nastily into the violence of another.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
In addition to creating a visually seductive atmosphere to draw viewers into Bigger's interior world, Johnson elicits a subtle performance from Sanders... Native Son's message is important, but its approach occasionally feels throwback.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Native Son vividly revives a seminal book, and once the movie and audience get their bearings, proves as thought-provoking as it is heartbreaking.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
An especially thoughtful film - that's already a given - but an unexpectedly inert one.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Despite that unevenness, there's no denying that Johnson's film, with a script by Pulitzer-winning playwright Suzan Lori-Parks, is an ambitious and arrestingly compelling work that packs a mighty punch.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Native Son challenges society to stop objectifying Black culture, showing how worshiping it can be just as dehumanizing as loathing or fearing it.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
Johnson's debut-buoyed by Parks' interpolation between adaption and rewriting Bigger's life-is a new direction to present story and emotion in their most visceral and affecting forms.
 "
Native Son,60,51,critic,"
It's understandable why the filmmakers wanted to avoid the worst of what we are capable... but it also makes the story become something far more common, and thus less than [Novelist Richard] Wright's vision.

The Last Black Man in San Francisco,92,84,audience,This was one of the greatest movies of all time.
The Last Black Man in San Francisco,92,84,audience,"One of the most emotionally resonant cinematic experiences of the decade. Joe Talbot confidently established himself as a filmmaking talent to keep an eye on, filling the lens with emmaculate framing and gorgeous symmetry. The plot is told with lovely panache and style, and yet its visual distinctions are never favored over strongly crafted storytelling, authentic dialogue, and raw, enthralling character development. All of this culminates in a finale that ends on a bittersweet note, one that simultaneously conveys melancholy and loneliness with hope and closure.

Lead actor Jimmie Fails shines as himself in this film, which is a semi-biographical portrait of his life in the ever-changing city. The best performance, however, comes from Jonathan Majors, playing his long-time best friend Mont.

The score for this film is beautiful and melodic, nicely complimenting the beautifully photographed setting of San Francisco, making the city feel as much of a character as any person in it.

Overall, The Last Black Man in San Francisco is a richly rewarding and emotionally poignant cinematic art piece whose social consciousness, startling honesty, and powerful setup make it essential viewing for cinephiles and casual audiences alike."
The Last Black Man in San Francisco,92,84,audience,"a brilliant cinematic experience with an emotional soundtrack and a provoking message about home, race, and the American dream"
The Last Black Man in San Francisco,92,84,audience,"The Last Black Man in San Francisco is a beautiful love poem to the city and a story of how the living can haunt a house.   This is towards the art cinema side of the spectrum but the narrative is straightforward (although  I found ""the play"" a little over the top - not all will).   The acting is top notch and the story is semi-autobiographical about the led performer.  Its on amazon prime if you are looking for something a little different.   It is also a great chance to see Jonathan Majors (before he plays Kang in the Marvel movies).  3 1/2 stars out of 5.  (For a film this gorgeous ...the dull movie posters are a bit disappointing.)"

The Last Black Man in San Francisco,92,84,audience,waste of 2 hours. pretty obvious messaging but takes advantage of the chance you give it and looks promising. but goes absolutely no where.
The Last Black Man in San Francisco,92,84,audience,"Indie gem taps the sins and spirit of a city which shaped American culture then, now, and looks for answers on how to restore faith in humanity amidst cultural divides and capitalistic genocide."
The Last Black Man in San Francisco,92,84,audience,"""You are not just one thing""

Neither is this movie. From the onset, I was expecting this to be a poetic film. It looked pretty, I immediately took notice of the score and even the script had a lyric quality. But at the halfway point the movie grabbed me in a way that I was expecting and I ended up really connecting with it. All of us can embrace ideas about identity and legacy, friendship, and empathy. This is the first movie this year that I feel as altered how I feel about myself in a positive way."

The Last Black Man in San Francisco,92,84,critic,"
In terms of more mainstream Hollywood bromance films, The Last Black Man in San Francisco signals a major departure.
 "
The Last Black Man in San Francisco,92,84,critic,"
The film would be an achievement in terms of character and theme alone, but Talbot shows an awareness for imagery that elevates the script even further (co-written with Rob Richert and co-conceived with Fails).

The opening 5 minutes alone are cinematic heaven and we can only hope Talbot and Fails return in years to come to tell more stories.

Sweetheart,95,52,audience,So weird. Makes no sense.
Sweetheart,95,52,audience,"This is a great monster movie, I actually couldn't look away.  Idk why reviews are picking apart the acting... A couple of supporting actors could've used some extra lessons, but they weren't terrible.  The main character is excellent, the story is excellent, & there is no crappy CGI, what more could u want from a movie?"
Sweetheart,95,52,audience,"The first half is a slow burn with plenty to be admired. It includes some very effective jump scares and tension building. The second half sort of falters including the generic 'we don't believe you' characters that are totally unlikeable. Otherwise, a quite fun monster movie."
Sweetheart,95,52,audience,"Kiersey Clemons is indeed excellent, but that doesn't come close to saving it from being rushed, poorly acted (other than Kiersey Clemons of course), and left to be empty of emotion. They definitely wanted to make Sweetheart a scary movie, but failed miserably by showing too much."
Sweetheart,95,52,audience,I love feminist horror movies please keep them coming
Sweetheart,95,52,audience,"Similar to ""Castaway"", but with a deadly creature that eats anything in it's path. It was definitely entertaining and passed the time, but the plot wasn't anything too special or original."
Sweetheart,95,52,audience,"Predictable plot, stock characters, terrible script, low quality special effects, bad acting. You're better off watching Creature of the Black Lagoon again."
Sweetheart,95,52,audience,Sweetheart e inexoravelmente bom
Sweetheart,95,52,audience,I gave this the two and a half stars for the actress's performance. As I say I wish I could give it negative stars for the creature. Seriously? This movie had no budget one actress and Island that's about it for 50% of the movie then and the few actors. Could you spend a little money on the creature and the CGI? So disappointing.
Sweetheart,95,52,audience,"A tale of nightmare in paradise has a promising start but takes a turn for the worse when an unexpected guest turns up, and I'm not talking about the monster. This film might have been more interesting if it had leaned more into allegory a la It Follows, or given us a longer look at the heroine's relationships as Midsommar did to great effect. Sweetheart doesn't quite work, but is instructive in illustrating why and how other entries in this smart new microgenre of horror films do."

If Beale Street Could Talk,95,71,audience,"RATING: A+  Director: Barry Jenkins 
If Beale Street Could Talk is a gorgeously shot romance with a poignant theme. Led by an amazing performance from Kiki Layne and an outstanding supporting performance from ( because of this ) Academy Awards Winner Regina King the film comes with a timely theme. The Screenplay is great and the score is really capturing. Barry Jenkins Direction is fantastic as always and he really uses long takes often here. The 2:1 Aspect Ratio is really fitting with the Cinematography."

Unique camera movements and a beautiful accompanying music score create a intensely intimate atmosphere throughout, which makes us feel the emotionality of love over the plot events. The film tells the stories of black discrimination through its characters, acted beautifully, but not explored in depth enough to give the issues as much substance as it could have. Reminds me of films like Nobody Knows and Blue Valentine."

Shoplifters,99,91,audience,"I loved it to my fullest. It's more than a movie, it's love on a screen"
Shoplifters,99,91,audience,"Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters is a film that redefines the concept of family.  Set in Tokyo, a group of outsiders live in the margins and shadows of society, relying on each other (and sometimes less than dubious measures) to survive.  The majority of the film focuses on the relationships within the family unit as they scramble for money and food, but the revelations over the last thirty minutes are, at times, devastating.  Koreeda's directing choices are beautiful, as he opts for long takes and slow zooms to amp up the emotional impact, which is significant as things become clear to the viewer."
Shoplifters,99,91,audience,Beautiful! I got so impacted.
Shoplifters,99,91,audience,"Amazing, bittersweet, heartfelt. It truly hits you in the feels. This film is an exercise in contrast. The contrast between the warmth of family and the coldness of societal expectations. The way truth can be distorted. And the utter bitter sweetness of a family that is so loving yet does not know to send their kids to school."
Shoplifters,99,91,audience,"As has become the case, movies have bad endings. Other than that, a good movie. A fun story, superb acting. Dialogue is frustrating and not natural in parts, but overall good. A story heading towards a conclusion that can't be happy is exactly where it lands."
Shoplifters,99,91,audience,"Really beautiful film, immense tenderness. The writer and direction show a deep understanding of familial tangles, joys, and, the losses of misunderstanding. It's a bit long, yet a pleasure all the way through. Strong acting from the whole multigenerational cast."
Shoplifters,99,91,audience,Absolutely excellent
Shoplifters,99,91,audience,Beautiful film. Perfect.
Shoplifters,99,91,audience,What a wonderfully touching film. I want to hug every one of them and tell them it'll be alright 
Shoplifters,99,91,audience,"Heartbreaking because it gives a touch of humor and pain, both are killer combos for a good movie tackling a lot of societal challenges"

Director/writer Hirokazu Kore-eda handles the film with a pragmatic yet empathetic eye and as a result, crafts together one of the year's best movies that clutches the heartstrings by the time the credits roll.

Monster Party,76,52,audience,"Wow! This is the very first movie I felt obligated to actually rate. Slow start, but stick with it. You'll see for yourself why I rated it 5/5"
Monster Party,76,52,audience,"Good plot, corny execution"
Monster Party,76,52,audience,"I didn’t buy the whole dad losing money gambling to a strip club owner forcing a son to scheme a heist in order to save him . Something about it just didnt seem believable to me the whole time and that really bothered me . 2.4 . The idea was original .... and I rarely criticize acting, but 50% of it was not good . In the end the movie is still very easily watchable "
Monster Party,76,52,audience,Murdering massacre mayhem at a Malibu mansion. Bloody good fun.
Monster Party,76,52,audience,I really enjoyed this movie. I've said this before with another Shudder exclusive but it feels like a great plot and a lot of money was given to a film crew that only shoots low budget films. Could've been executed just a little bit better. Either way good movie and I dont regret choosing it. Ending could've been a bit better though. Wish they would make a second with Casper and Iris doin some sorta mission together or something.
Monster Party,76,52,audience,"I think this was supposed to be campy, but the script is awful and technically poorly crafted. A waste of talented stars."
Monster Party,76,52,audience,Started out like a solid story idea and turned into something that did not make any sense.
Monster Party,76,52,audience,"Ridiculous. While I am sure the Director was hoping for the unusual camera moves, dreamy scenes to give an edge to the scenes, overall it is a poor and lose storyline. Conceptually similar to Kill Bill, but simply too much and to confusing."
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
While Monster Party seems to want to come off as something else than a horror movie at the start, but once it gets fully into horror territory, it becomes really fun and full of insanity.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
Goddamn, I love this deranged world that Chris von Hoffmann has created. It's crazy, violent, a bit shocking, and a lot of fun.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
'Monster Party' features a great cast with some familiar faces, and has a nice blend of gruesome action and twisted story.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
A familiar story with not enough individuality to stand apart from its superiors, Monster Party (released in UK as Killer Party) is at best a throwaway film, one that won't stick in memory for long.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
Monster Party does what it does very well, bringing a clownish kind of horror comedy to the screen with liberal helpings of gore and blood.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
Though there's nothing here that's likely to really wow the viewer, Killer Party is an appealingly silly idea that's nicely fleshed out and delivered with sufficient confidence to facilitate the suspension of disbelief.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
Overall,Monster Partyis a hyper-violent horror film that lives in a by-gone period of horror in the worst ways. While the action is entertaining and the kills extremely brutal and creative, it isn't much beyond that.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
Never boring, the movie does what it set out to do with the final product being a quick gory horror romp with a modern sensibility. Not to be too puny, Monster Party is a bloody good time and a big recommend for a modern-day slasher flick.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
One of those movies that has the kind of premise that initially sounds intriguing enough to make you wonder why no one had ever tried to tell such a story before and then spends the next 90 minutes showing you exactly why no one has bothered to do so.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
A brainless gore-fest like Monster Party doesn't need so many steroid-enhanced flourishes.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
While it's not engrossing in some well-heeled, Oscar-winning vote way, Monster Party knows its playbook and delivers in record time.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
Von Hoffman brings some admirable oomph, as well as a good understanding of the many ways that criminals - both poor and rich - exert dominance.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
For a certain brand of cult film aficionado, Monster Party is going to be a ton of fun, as the influences are proudly worn on its sleeve.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
Chris von Hoffman's Monster Party ranks as one of the better genre entries. It packs much more suspense, humor and shock value than the current Halloween reboot.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
... loses momentum after its big reveal, but even the subsequent descent into ultraviolent mayhem is handled with an agreeably twisted playfulness.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
There's some decent ideas here, but von Hoffman fails to develop them properly and isn't worth recommending over the far more engaging and suspenseful Don't Breathe.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
Monster Party is a violent ride of a home invasion horror movie that puts its own stylistic spin on the genre, but doesn't fully rise above the pack.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
Gleefully gory and darkly funny, Monster Party is the sort of extreme genre exercise that separates real fans from mere dilettantes.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
We need the attacks to increase in frequency with little breathing room because Monster Party's success comes from our being too wrapped up in the brutality to question logic.
 "
Monster Party,76,52,critic,"
Monster Party is a delicious nasty bit of violence which both leans into the tropes the horror genre is known for while adding some new flavor along the way.

Can You Ever Forgive Me?,98,81,audience,"Melissa McCarthy si dimostra una volta di più un'attrice meravigliosa; il suo personaggio è perfetto nei suoi difetti ed è nudo di ogni segreto agli occhi dello spettatore.
La trama, tratta da una storia vera, è lineare e totalmente superparte, non si sofferma più del dovuto su nessun punto e si chiude esattamente come è iniziata; senza moralismi."
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,98,81,audience,"Can you ever forgive me has a great performance about a bitter drunk that pulled off a low key fraud . ..but there is not much that happens, it is a testament to McCarthy  that the audience has any sympathy for the protagonist by the time it is done.  3 stars out of 5"
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,98,81,audience,CAN YOU ONE DAY FORGIVE ME? is a movie that Melissa mcCarthy has a great performance and manages to interpret her character very well and has part of the film that you get a lot of doe lee israel and for being a little sad biography film.
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,98,81,audience,Great performances by Mellisa McCartney and Richard E Grant.
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,98,81,audience,"Great combination of an intelligent script, unusual story, Richard E Grant  (who adds stature to any production) and finally a worthwhile role for a star quality actor I have always had a fondness for and has too often had her talent wasted, Melissa McCarthy."
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,98,81,audience,Ok mediocre sad depressing movie starring Melissa McCarthy. I'm not too fond of sad depressing movies but if a movie makes me cry then it's good. This movie was just sad but not cry sad. I'll forget about this movie in t minus 3 minutes.
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,98,81,audience,"A delight of a movie. Compelling story, great acting, classic filmmaking really capture the essence of the well-worn lives of the characters living in 70s thru early 80s New York. I was captivated by the story, wittingly told, from the first frames all the way until closing credits. "
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,98,81,audience,"Lee Israel earned success as a celebrity biographer during the 1970's and early 1980's.  However, when her writing fell out of favour with her publisher and audiences she found herself struggling for to make an income.  Out of desperation she finds she has a skill for forgery, beginning with forging signatures of the famous icons of years gone by and then finding that she could write in the voice of these famous figures and went onto forging private letters which sold for a great deal of money at auctions. 
Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant both hold their own here as two social rejects struggling to get ahead in life, grasping at any opportunity that is thrown their way.  Both are very watchable and despite them performing mass deception you find yourself willing them to get away with it because they play memorable and likeable characters.  It's also just a fascinating story, how Lee Israel managed to get away with this deception for such a long time and also the sheer skill she had for bringing long dead celebrity icons back to life on paper, having close friends and colleagues believing the fakes were real.  An interesting tale of literary deception in the 80's."
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,98,81,audience,"Jamás había visto a una actriz tan metida en su personaje, creo que Hollywood no se daba cuenta lo versátil que puede llegar a ser Melissa McCarthy. En tanto a la película está muy bien adaptada que te pone nervioso en cada falsificación que Lee cometía y deseando que parara de hacerlo antes de que la descubrieran, de las mejores adaptaciones del cine del 2019."

An inoffensive story that serves as a platform for its performers, rather than creating a character study that will be worth remembering in years to come.

The story may be mostly true, but the movie makes it believable. It contains no flashbacks, no explanations, just narrative drive and character exposition.

Widows,91,61,audience,A suspenseful slow-paced thriller !!!
Widows,91,61,audience,"In the first hour of the movie, it switches from scene to scene and later connects the pieces - Just tedious and nothing special. The critics score of plus 90% is simply beyond me. I guess some get paid to simply sell movies. I don't; I just want to enjoy them!"
Widows,91,61,audience,"I like Steve McQueen and the cast  I really wanted to like widows but it was a big disappointment. This is because of  the plot. widows should have been centered around the widows and the heist. However we get neither. Lengthy pointless dialogs, too many character who either disappear or introduced very late. considering its running time (2 hours 9 mins) , no characters really develop or questions are answered properly. some scenes looks out of place or felt in it was in the wrong order."
Widows,91,61,audience,Meh it was ok. Action packed but very average to me.
Widows,91,61,audience,Your review will help others decide whether to watch.
Widows,91,61,audience,"Slow, with unsympathetic characters and a weak ending "
Widows,91,61,audience,A third of the way through and nothing had happened except a bit of random violence. We had no interest in any of the characters and just could not be bothered to watch the rest.
Widows,91,61,audience,"It would be a whole lot better if some of the slow and pointless 'filling' was removed. Condensed in that way, it would feel more tense and fluid. Overall, it's strength is in its female leads, for sure - how this was Davis' first lead role in a major production, I'll never know! The story is good, too, which helps. With such a strong and experienced ensemble to hand, I can't help but feel McQueen had more he could have played with to really make this movie standout. I didn't realise he had adapted this from the mini-series in 1983+5, written by Lynda La Plante"
Widows,91,61,audience,I went into this movie seeing the critical Acclaim and that was a mistake. It certainly cannot meet the higher expectations of its assigned rating but it is a relatively entertaining movie. Critics often Seem to be looking at movies through a political spectrum and not remembering their job is to decipher whether a movie is entertaining or not. First half is certainly very well done and entertaining but it does drag towards the second half. That said a pretty good heist movie with solid performances
Widows,91,61,audience,"The best part about this movie is that it was devoid of all that Hollywood BS. It's what would happen to real people, real women if put in this situation. No unrealistic superpowers just real women rising to the challenge and finding the strength within"
Widows,91,61,critic,"
I'm not convinced that McQueen's successful at every single thing he tries to address, but I give him credit for his ambition.

 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
McQueen's Widows is unconventional, builds its story with unique chess moves, and carries a style that grabs your attention.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
Widows is a nail-biter and suspenseful until the very ending. After it was over, I wanted to experience that ride all over again.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
Yet if the story's political, racial and gender subtext sometimes acts as a drag on the action, it gives the film a depth and richness other films of the genre often lack.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
A pitch-perfect demonstration of an auteurist director demonstrating his singular vision in a more mainstream canvas.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
""Widows"" resembles an urban expose like ""The Wire"" more than a caper romp like ""Ocean's 8."" It's much tougher, grittier, literally a matter of life and death. Tone is everything in a movie and, in this one, McQueen sticks to it brilliantly.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
It's a rare experience when you watch a film that you didn't want to end, and it's not every day where I call out something that merits five stars. But this is a five-star film, continuing McQueen's outstanding record in filmmaking.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
McQueen plays gleefully with all the genre's tropes, from double crosses to training montages, subtly rewiring the interpersonal relationships and motivations, all while two of the women juggle childcare.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
Widows does a generally decent job at keeping its pace up for most of the film, but it can be occasionally dispiriting for some of its meatier themes to fall by the wayside.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
Gritty and ferocious, McQueen has you rooting for these ladies from the get-go, you feel invested in the story from the very beginning.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
Widows is an instant crime classic.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
The heist itself isn't all that clever, but the way the plot slowly unfurls is both brainy and emotionally intense.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
The cast makes up for most of the missing pieces.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
It's a genuine pleasure watching all of these talents work together in various combinations, moving through this layered, well-structured story. Widows is easily one of the best films of the year.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
I hesitate not a whit in calling Widows the most satisfying heist film of the year.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
An incredibly well-made, taut and realistic heist thriller. It's not a fun romp the way the Ocean's series, and others cut from that cloth, tend to be. This is a brutal film that pulls no punches.
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
It is a gloomy, violent film, but it can also be boring. There are excesses that inevitably take their toll. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Widows,91,61,critic,"
While the sound and fury produced a robust response... the end result felt to me like a second-rate Elmore Leonard crime caper, a little too fanciful to be either top-drawer drama or stirring feminist tale.

Burning,95,80,audience,"These other reviewers, saying what a great movie this was, must have seen another movie. It reminds me of a bunch of art critics looking at a paint stain, discussing all the symbolism, angst and use of negative space. Sorry, but it's just a lousy paint stain and this is just a lousy movie."
Burning,95,80,audience,"It was honestly terrible. I was constantly waiting for the big exciting part but it never came. It was so boring and irritating. The characters were very irritating, their relationship made no sense. A lot of things were left unexplained. Some parts were made out in the start to be big mysterious secrets and turned out to be dull or not even important to the storyline. Why was his father going to jail not linked to anything else at all? Why does he run into this woman who he called ugly in high school and then automatically his whole life revolves around her and he has sex with her right away? Why do we not get to see Ben actually talk about being a serial killer? He just gets killed with no explanation? No after part, we don't see if his body is found, we don't find out what he did with Hae Mi, just that she's presumably dead? This movie gave me major blue balls and I am female. I was left very unsatisfied and I am annoyed I wasted my time on it."
Burning,95,80,audience,"Lee Chang-dong's Burning is a film about three young adults trying to find meaning in their lives.  Aspiring novelist Jong-su has an intimate but brief relationship with Hae-mi, a childhood friend who he once mocked for being ugly.  When Hae-mi returns from a soul-searching trip to Africa with a male acquaintance she met during her travels, things become complicated between the three main characters.  The film swings from romance to mystery when Hae-mi suddenly disappears, setting into motion a tragic chain of events.  The movie is beautifully directed by Lee, who manages to keep the audience guessing from start to finish.  Everything about Burning is subtle and understated, including the performances of the three lead actors."
Burning,95,80,audience,"Mesmerizing. Reviews said it evolves. At first thought its another class clash like parasite, then I compared it to reality bites. But only after seeing it and then reading the hurakami story, and the Faulkner story, did I deepen my understanding. Who knew how imp. The pantomime of the tangerine peeling really was?"
Burning,95,80,audience,melancholic and meaningful movie watching experience 
Burning,95,80,audience,"A beautiful and excellent movie, although it may run a little slow for some. Reading through some of these reviews, it's obvious quite a few people took some of the dialogue literally and didn't connect the dots because of this. That WOULD make for a pretty boring movie. It does give you the answers, but you have to pay attention and read between the lines to get them. I didn't even find it all that complicated. Honestly, I think some people just don't know what a metaphor is (they purposefully bring this up in the movie) or missed that part of the dialogue, which makes the intended interpretation unmistakable."
Burning,95,80,audience,"Not awful, but not good. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn’t watch it...but it’s slow, and you never get answers. Too esoteric for me."
Burning,95,80,audience,Story was super slow.  Boring as heck.
Burning,95,80,audience,"Very good, so nice shots, nice palette of colors. Very good movie."
Burning,95,80,audience,Get ready for a slow burn.
Burning,95,80,critic,"
Burning is a slow-burn thriller that is utterly captivating from beginning to end. It's economic emasculation that brings inevitable violence. It's Lee's script that shines: layered with hefty metaphors and symbolism, yet the film is surprisingly subtle.

Burning is a superior thriller with a double edge - a film that's about a doomed romantic obsession and also a social critique that lays bare the impotency of an outsider seeking to understand the opaque world of the mega rich.

Lee is patient with the story. He illustrates the rather grim reality of how circumstance and people can define you and shape your perception of the world for better or worse.

The Man Who Feels No Pain,94,79,audience,"Writing left a lot to be desired. It just wasn't entertaining or engaging enough but the 3 star score comes for the concept and the audacity of the movie. Other than that, it could have done a whole lot better."
The Man Who Feels No Pain,94,79,audience,The stupidest movie I have ever seen. I mean seriously what was going on. There was no story in the movie.
The Man Who Feels No Pain,94,79,audience,It's good. But the story would have better then it.
The Man Who Feels No Pain,94,79,audience,Awesome movie. It's an off beat movie. I loved it. Abhimanyu was fantastic. The lead actress was also great. Would love to see more of Abhimanyu in bollywood. Loved the dialogue and music also.

Vasan Bala's film has endearing characters who all call for a big celebratory leap forward for conventional Hindi films; but the entire arc that comes along with the self-awareness lacks real oomph or glow.

The Predator,33,33,audience,Horrible movie with a lot of bad bad acting.
The Predator,33,33,audience,"Every-time that they take a good movie and attempt to make a franchise of it, someone decides to shift it to a Hallmark movie. Boring from the first ten minutes, a few laughs but totally tone-deaf to what appealed to us about the original (and sequel). Stop shoving heroines and autistic kids into what is essentially an action movie with sci-fi elements. Save that crap for Lifetime TV. What's worse Olivia Munn looks horrid in this picture, how do you make a pretty chick uggh? Now that took special effects. Didn't even sit thru the last third. Straight-up bore-fest. Like watching the Transformers/Alien/Terminator/Mad Max franchise all over again. Stop screwing with what works already and stop using milquetoast directors."

To Black's credit, he argues that the autism spectrum is not a handicap but rather the next step on the evolutionary chain. Still, even these commendable choices can't make up for the bizarre suburban setting, immature dialogue and gory graphics.

In 1987 Shane Black played Hawkins, the first of Arnold Schwarzenegger's burly soldiers to get brutally eviscerated by the dreadlocked alien hunter. If only this was the death of his involvement in a franchise that has rotted from the head down ever since

The pure action sequences do rock, but aside from the occasional hilarious zinger, the rest rarely gets on a roll for long.

The rapport between characters feels insincere, the juvenile humor suffocates whatever '80s thrills could unfold, and all actors are fully at the mercy of their lines.

The Predator is a violent, explosive and gory action film. In other words, exactly what you expect from a Predator movie.
 "

""The Predator"" is one hot mess.
 "

The screenplay is weak, the humor is lame, the action is this smorgasbord of dizzying darkness and poor CGI. The Predator rips the spinal column out of this franchise and chooses stupidity and redundancy over an actual evolution.

Digital missteps apart, 'Predator' is largely satisfactory during the vast majority of its length. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Predator,33,33,critic,"
Were it not for the garish, deliberate insensitivity, The Predator would still be caught between mocking/imitating sci-fi action flicks of 30-40 years ago and trying to legitimately restart a major studio franchise.

Too slick, too schematic, and bears the imprint of too much studio interference.

Sorry to Bother You,93,70,audience,"I may be feeling a tad sensitive in this weird woke era. This is the dystopian tale of a young black man Cassius Green, who discovers his hidden telemarketer's skill of dropping his Afro American accent and being able to chat in a friendly confident ""white""  mid American one.  From a student like existence he propels himself to the exalted position of super caller, earning big bucks yet leaving all his ""comrades"" to fend for themselves in the middle of an industrial dispute.  It is humorous in places and the production values and acting are fine.
The problem I have with the film is that every single negative character in the movie is white, the path to success is by having a white accent and every kind/positive character in the movie is black/asian heritage.  Ok, so there needs to be some social re-balancing but really, is this supposed to be part of the dialogue?  I feel like a whole racial group is being called out and labelled as the nasty bunch.  How racist is that?"
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,audience,"Really unique idea to promote workers rights, really enjoyed it."
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,audience,Made me rethink my relationship to work. Also was really creepy and made me anxious for ages afterwards
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,audience,"This has to be easily one of the most shocking movies I've ever seen. This movie gives you glimpses into its oddities early on but I never expect it to be so strange. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this move. All the humor lands, killer soundtrack, great acting, and great parallels to America's corporate greed and income inequality. That said, I don't think this film is going to be for everyone, I think some of the choices made in this film are going to turn off a lot of more casual movie goers."

Sorry to Bother You,93,70,audience,Thanks to Boots Riley’s intelligently unique screenplay. Sorry To Bother You is a funny and insightful look at capitalism and what goes on behind the scenes. 
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,audience,"Not what I expected, a little over the top but if you want to see an original movie that is very out of ordinary this is it.  I can see why the audience score varies from the critic's score - it's not for everybody but it is fresh and original."

Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
This rock-em-sock-em debut for musician-turned-director Boots Riley is wackier and wilder than anything else you're likely to see in a movie theater this year. That's a good thing, likely even a great one.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
Riley is telling us something other than his movie's message. He's announcing that he's a new cinematic voice to listen to...
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
Bizarre, razor sharp, and uncomfortably hilarious all at once, Sorry to Bother You is an unforgettable film watching experience.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
Boots Riley's wild sci-fi flick charges hard out of the gate with social commentary, but lacks the horsepower to go the distance.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
Boots Riley celebrates the surreal and satirical absurdity of our world, and it's so fantastically unique that it's unlike any film I've seen.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
A brave and radical departure from many a filmmaking norm, highly recommended to those who appreciate chances taken and rules broken.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
Sorry to Bother You welcomes audiences to deconstruct its own inner-workings not just to better understand its rhetoric, but also the backhanded logic of its own reality.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
A bold indictment of capitalism, consumerism, and cultural appropriation
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
Your either going to love this or hate it, there simply is no compromised middle ground with this completely unhinged, ethereal take on corporate manipulation and slavery, class prejudices and racial perceptions.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
Stanfield and Thompson are the driving forces and the binding agents, and I'm not sure Sorry to Bother You works without them. Either way, it's a vision of the future worthy of your attention and expanded brain power.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
There's at least three different films smashed together here, and if taking things a little slower might have given some of the ideas room to breathe, it's this film's breathless energy that helps get the others over the line
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
Sharp, vivid, often uncomfortable, but frequently hilarious, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU is a bold and distinctive vision that is rightly nowhere near as apologetic as the title.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
It's probably impossible to make a film that captures 2018's insane zeitgeist, but Boots Riley has come uncomfortably close.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
It's not an easy watch, but it is memorable and compelling -- the rare film that comments on the peculiar details of a historical moment while we are still going through it and makes all too clear sense of it.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
You never stop rooting for Cassius, even when he's lured into making poor choices. And just when you think it can't get any weirder, it does.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
Combining science-fiction, comedy and politics amid the dull world of telemarketing, Sorry to Bother You is chaotic, creative and needs to be seen to be believed.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
What a treat for audiences who love to see original, fearless filmmaking.
 "
Sorry to Bother You,93,70,critic,"
Sorry to Bother You is as much a character-driven story about the gentrification of Oakland -- and the Bay Area writ large -- as it is an absurdist anti-capitalist fable.

Excellent docu about West Coast hip-hop; cursing, drugs.
 "
G-Funk,,,critic,"
Now, more than ever, it's crucial that we chronicle and discuss black cultural icons and products, from the good to the bad. And when it comes to something as influential as G-funk and the people behind it, ""G-Funk"" does just that.

This movie was a lesson in not only this subgenre of hip hop; but analysis about the business of the music industry as well as how relationships, allegiances, and fame play a role in how deals are made and broken.

The Misandrists,71,46,audience,I can't think of anyone on it's right mind to see a movie like this

 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
The Misandrists will definitely shock some and piss others off while it will make some say ""hell yeah"" and have more give the central subject some thought, but the potential shock factor, mostly through sex and blood, has a point.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
The Misandrists misfires not because it lampoons grave subject matter, but in how lazily and unevenly it does so.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
If off-kilter pornographic social commentary is your bag then it's certainly worth a watch despite its problematic elements.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
The Misandrists is supposed to be a send-up of radical feminism, but it only occasionally shows any understanding of feminist thinking, and the film isn't funny for a second.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
The Misandrists walks dangerously close to 'respectability' at times - [Bruce's] aesthetic has cleaner lines, crisper framing, story structure that veers uncharacteristically towards (dare I say it) conventional.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
The blend of comedy, horror and social statement, while sometimes exciting, is too often a muddy mix.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
The film has countless opportunities to go wrong... but it mostly works.

For LaBruce fans and fearless curiosity seekers only.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
LaBruce cuts through the pretense of recent mainstream-movie sexuality.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
At times, it seems like a parody of itself but manages to beguile while it sermonizes.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
I wonder if every viewer will understand that the film's unique tone is offered in the spirit of affection, rather than contempt, for radical feminism.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
Director Bruce LaBruce tries hard to be the next John Waters, but can't even top D.E.B.S..
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
""The Misandrists"" is a bad taste manifesto with an extreme feminist agenda.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
It's bold, transgressive and at times very funny, but doesn't pull everything together in the end.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
Clever, yes. But its slow execution and cardboard acting doesn't play nice.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
...featuring intentionally cardboard characterizations and wooden acting along side highly charged sexual images, the script is replete with references to political theory that move so quickly from the lips of the actors that I couldn't keep up.
 "
The Misandrists,71,46,critic,"
If John Waters and Karl Marx co-directed a remake of The Beguiled, the resulting feature would be very much like Bruce LaBruce's The Misandrists.

Virginia Minnesota,71,76,audience,"not too many movies have earned my shutting them off in the first 30 minutes, but this quickly felt like a real waste of time with over the top attitudes and typical silly indie humor. Someone was playing a guitar, keyboard or banjo around every corner, and this will do as much damage to Minnesotans for incorrect stereotypes as Fargo did. Pretty much a girl flick for millennials. ""Mister....off""."
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,audience,"What a boring and utterly useless movie. I'm from MN and still hated it,"
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,audience,"Tremendously entertaining !! Characters you can endear yourself to, with a story to match. As a bonus, almost a highlight reel of Minnesota

Virginia Minnesota,71,76,audience,"Beautiful, heartwarming movie with the perfect touch of magical realism."
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,audience,"The cool thing about road trips, is that you never know what to expect. I think what Daniel Stine does with this film, is capture the ups and downs of what real friendships are like through those layers of drama, comedy and suspense, that these 2 girls go through. Real life is just that. Moment to moment craziness. 

The chemistry between the 4 actresses was phenomenal! And the supporting cast was just as perfect! I give a big thumbs up to whoever casted these roles. Incredible talent from up and comers, that I know we'll be hearing more about soon.

And lastly, the cinematography, WOW!! GORGEOUS! ð'?ð?»ð'?ð?»

Virginia Minnesota,71,76,audience,"This movie explores the relationship between 2 damaged girls who after going their separate ways, reunite for a great adventure just minutes from where they grew up. It captures the ""Range"" mentality perfectly while taking the viewer through a host of emotions. Well shot with engaging dialogue, this an early look at one of the next great storytellers."
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,audience,good script and good characters (especially the robot suitcase) my rating is 3/5.
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,critic,"
It almost makes sense. It almost comes together. It's almost good. It was almost worth watching.
 "
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,critic,"
In his directorial debut, Daniel Stine is able to weave a charming story that's sweet, poignant, mysterious, and even surreal at times. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and it can be said this is a love letter to Northern Minnesota.
 "
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,critic,"
Virginia Minnesota is the kind of film you hope you run into when you head off the beaten path well-trodden with the same old ideas.
 "
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,critic,"
Winning lead performances and some uniquely quirky touches keep this dramedy watchable from start to finish, but an over-reliance on indie film clichés... add up to squandered potential.
 "
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,critic,"
While this is surely the stuff of romcom boilerplate narratives, Virginia Minnesota prefers to wade into darker waters for the sake of more compelling, everyday drama.
 "
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,critic,"
But the chemistry between the female-led cast is so strong that it carries the film over any narrative bumps
 "
Virginia Minnesota,71,76,critic,"
The tonal shifts among mystery, folklore, melodrama and satire are neither smooth nor productively rough, and the narrative core remains unclear, lost amid the surfeit of disconnected moving parts.

Devil's Whisper,,56,audience,"I was confused at first, then the pace picked up and by the end i was enjoying every minute and generally enjoyed the whole movie!"
Devil's Whisper,,56,audience,Interesting story but the acting was bad.  And its not as scary as it tries to be.
Devil's Whisper,,56,audience,"I'm torn on the movie Devil's Whisper. One side of me finds the film stylish, well acted and some of its ideas daring. The other side of me, however, cannot abide yet another movie where a demon of dubious abilities opens doors, manipulates electricity, or other such nonsense via mind control or some sort of demonic form ESP. When will filmmakers tire of these moronic tropes? When will a movie that has some good ideas about how to couch evil in a horror form to discuss big issues? Devil's Whisper approaches big ideas but can't resist demonic silliness. https://horror.media/movie-review-devil-s-whisper?_ga=2.63351279.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710"
Devil's Whisper,,56,audience,"DO NOT BELIEVE THE STAR RATING OR THE STUPID LIERS THAT SAID THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE. The acting was horrible, special effects were wack, and the story was average at best. I f'n hate bs reviews and I would love force them to watch this movie over and over again until they gouge thier own eyes out with thier lying little fingers. That would be a better film than this turdstain of a movie. "
Devil's Whisper,,56,audience,"Watch out! This movie is extremely scary for your wallet. The plot has no depth, so it makes me wonder whether the script of this movie was written by amateurs or just hastily put together at the end of the day. It starts out decent, but question marks soon follow and reach climax at the end. When does the boy becomes possessed? What does the devil want with the boy? Does the devil come to haunt the boy because he was molested? When is the boy under the influence of the devil and when is not? It seems like there are more questions than scary moments in the movie.

Watching this movie is like watching a mouse hole in your house: it's plain, boring, and not scary. The movie is really trying to create jumpy moments; yet the absence of any psychological effect just made me stare at the screen. Instead of making the audience questioning who's the devil, the movie reveals it in the beginning. Even with the movie's decent special effects, it really feels like I was watching a B-horror movie.

Seriously, I have no idea how it can get good reviews. I think that's what scares me the most."
Devil's Whisper,,56,audience,"The short: this movie was exceptionally amateur.  
The long of it is that this movie had almost nothing going well for it.  From the acting to the plot to the writing to the scenery - it all makes you really wonder who had written such glowing reviews of this movie.  Someone must have some connections to get this movie into movie theaters; it's breathtaking just how disjointed almost every aspect of this movie is.  
The movie starts out with a plot about a kid who wants to be a priest, finds a relic that had belonged to his grandfather, and somehow releases a demon.  Never  does the story ever go into how the demon got there, what it wants, how it is related to the grandfather, how it is related to the relic - basic plot stuff is seemingly unimportant.  It is just relic + kid = demon.  It gets worse from there as inconsistencies build.  Yes! They actually BUILD UP! One minute, the protagonist recognizes he has a demon, the next minute the demon is a fleeting idea in the background while the protagonist hangs out with his love interest. Does the demon make him possessive of her or does it make him want to hurt her? A little of both, actually - misogyny is maybe the most consistent aspect to the movie.  It is as if the movie was written by someone who doesn't understand that there can be an order of events, and that one event can lead to another, and that something happened as a result of something else.  I almost imagine that when writing the script, they just wrote a new scene every day, and kinda shuffled up the papers.  The result is the horrors of bad writing, and how important editors are.  It's scary that this movie was made, really! Maybe that's the only scary thing about it.
Crazy things that they tried to pass off as scenes: 
While a priest is praying, he hears voices, sees a baby in a military jacket (?)  that turns into a skeleton and then shatters, which somehow makes the priest collapse and have a stroke.  Turns out not to be one of those like serious strokes, and the priest just gets on with life. 
The main character attempts to commit suicide in order to stop himself from killing his sister, gets rescued by his father who, we learn in the scene, is conveniently a paramedic! Gets on with life. Suicide is a pretty serious idea to introduce so lightly without any clarification or real intention.  It's not dark, it's just dim.
One minute, the main character is becoming possessed, beats up his friend, steals a car, goes to jail, and lashes out at his parents, and nearly rapes a girl! The next minute he is having his sweet 16th birthday, couldn't be happier! Well, except that part about being all demonically possessed, but it's cool. The girl said she understood that like, everyone gets a little crazy.
Somehow the demon goes around and kills all three of Alex's best guy friends.  Alex  has a special ability to watch it maybe in his mind? Through the demon? Why does that happen? Who cares!  Next thing you know, Alex is at their funeral standing over a casket of one of the dead friends and, moving on! That's done, no more of that, end scene!  
Like, they killed a bunch of characters, but couldn't be bothered to even complete whole scene! 
The actor who plays Alex, the main character, should just stick to modeling.  How do you know he's possessed? He's staring right at the camera! How do you know he isn't possessed? He's looking down sheepishly.  He should get an award for the lowest range of expression caught on film.  He was not even able to convincingly drink from a bottle.  A bottle.  
As it turns out, the special effects on the demon itself wasn't horrible, but all it seems to be able to do is awkwardly rub itself in a weird way, get kinda smokey, and maybe snarl a bit.  It didn't seem interested in actually hurting anyone, so, not much of a demon, really.  
This movie is not worth seeing, not even to laugh at."
Devil's Whisper,,56,audience,"What an amazing horror movie! I'm very impressed with this one, and would recommend it highly to any horror fan!"
Devil's Whisper,,56,audience,"This is a wonderful film which boosts aspects of both horror and drama. The story of a young man finding out how the past and it's secrets can affect his future. This young man Alex, finds a box which ,much like a Pandora's box, it unleashes a demon that threatens his family. 
The cast in this film was absolutely amazing. Each character was portrayed beautifully. The standouts in this film were Luca Oriel as Alex, Alison Fernandez as Alicia and Rick Ravanello as Father Cutler. The interactions of all these characters is amazing and how they all deal with a Demonic possession is incredible. The entire Duran family is affected by the actions of Alex's opening of the box. This demon changes everything for the Duran family not only with its possession of Alex but also by bringing up his past abuse. Father Cutler and his past are also under attack by the demon and this diminishes his ability to help Alex deal with his possession. All I all this is an amazing movie that deals with topics of demonic possession, hidden family secrets and child abuse. It's a wonderfully done movie Adam Ripp directed pleas don't miss it"
Devil's Whisper,,56,audience,Great original story that was well directed.The acting was great as well with heartfelt scenes that took you on an emotional roller coaster with thrills and moments of excitement. Can't forget about the beautiful cinematography as well!
Devil's Whisper,,56,audience,"I had the privilege of seeing Devil's Whisper at a film festival and it was incredible. I could not find fault with any of it. I cannot recommend this film enough. The cast was incredible, Luca Oriel was amazing. I look forward to seeing more from this talented young man.  Kudos to Rick Ravanello as Father Cutler, he made what could have been stereotypical role into an integral part. The entire cast was spectacular and Adam Ripp, the director / cowriter kept everything advancing towards the climactic ending."
Devil's Whisper,,56,critic,"
Like any good spooky story, Devil's Whisper roots some of its terrors in real-life darkness that is as ubiquitous as it is often invisible to those who could help.
 "
Devil's Whisper,,56,critic,"
A mix of psychological and supernatural horror sure to linger after its final frame.
 "
Devil's Whisper,,56,critic,"
The execution of the film comes nowhere close to living up to its scenario.
 "
Devil's Whisper,,56,critic,"
Interesting enough to be almost adequate.

"Sophie Gold, the Diary of a Gold Digger",,,audience,"Every YOUNG, beautiful individual moving to LA to try acting or modeling should be required to watch this. One should think of this film less like a ""diary"" and more like a ""documentary."" The films message is clear and should be heard."
"Sophie Gold, the Diary of a Gold Digger",,,audience,I start watching the movie with a certain doubt but I can say that it caught me and I found it entertaining. The subject it's very hot these days but I believe that when this movie was developed the writer or writers did not know what will come. So I believe timing wise comes in the right moment. The movie has unknown actors with a fair to good performance. I would give this arthouse film between 3 and 4 stars.
"Sophie Gold, the Diary of a Gold Digger",,,critic,"
Sophie Gold snuffs its own light out by failing to be both a competent film and a story that has an ounce of the impact it intended to have in the first place.

Red Christmas,48,19,audience,"Christmas in Australia with an obnoxious family of squabbling, unlikable characters is interrupted when the matriarch's aborted child comes knocking to be reunited with his mother. Yes, it's the revenge of an aborted baby. Leaving aside the sheer idiocy of the premise this film had no redeeming features. Some characters put on fake American accents, the production and direction are like a no budget student film, nothing anyone does makes sense, the acting is done like it's a first draught read through, the killer fetus is dressed up in a full length cloak cloak and bandages for no apparent reason, everyone thinks it's cold despite christmas in Australia being in summer, the lighting resorts to lurid mono colours at random times and the effects are anything but special.
A bad idea with terrible execution. It baffles me this film was even made much less screened anywhere."
Red Christmas,48,19,audience,I thought of it early on as a b horror movie it's obviously not better than things like Halloween but there are worse movies out there in horror. I didn't think of it too good it left me with small questions. There's room for improvements but almost any movie has room for improvements even the best. (First movie rating)
Red Christmas,48,19,audience,"Not your average film... at all.  Maybe a bit offensive at times, I didn't mind at all and actually thought it gave more structure and profound results in the end.  A very good watch not permitted for everyone"
Red Christmas,48,19,audience,That's how I feel on Australian Christmas too.
Red Christmas,48,19,audience,"A rather poorly made horror film, Red Christmas doesn't deliver any scares.  The story follows a family celebrating Christmas in the Australian countryside that is visited by a mysterious stranger looking to settle some unfinished business.  Except for Dee Wallace the acting is universally bad, and the script isn't much better.  But it's the directing that really damns the film.  The kill scenes are poorly shot and there's no tension or suspense to them.  And the special effects are terrible; particularly the creature make-up, which is downright laughable.  Red Christmas is an amateurish film that doesn't work at all."
Red Christmas,48,19,audience,I cant remember the last time I saw a bad horror movie 
Red Christmas,48,19,audience,"The subject matter is compelling because it is deep and personal enough, but the filmmaker doesn't take it anywhere - it's just abrasive and sad.  It doesn't have a proper ending, so everything that happens leading to the end of the film was pointless and you find out you gave an hour and a half of your life to a film and a story that doesn't deserve your attention."
Red Christmas,48,19,audience,"I saw this shit on Netflix. It's so bad! The characters act retarted. First of all, why would let a random stranger with a cloak and wrapped skin inside your house. It's clearly the mom's fault almost everyone died of the family in this movie. It's so cheesy. It's so BORING! The mom just says I'm sorry bro when her own brother dies. REEEEEEETTAAARRTTTEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Red Christmas,48,19,audience,One of the worst Christmas horror movies ever. Just terrible.
Red Christmas,48,19,audience,"Cool little Christmas slasher/home invasion movie.  It's got a unique, nasty story and Dee Wallace's sincerity really brings more weight to the whole thing."
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Pointed, twisted, gory, and filled with a surprising amount of character development.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
... even after giving Red Christmas as much slack as possible, it's not a movie that can be considered good. A few good scenes here and there do not a great movie make.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
It's ultimately a well-done slasher film with an interesting enough gimmick. It's over the top in ways that horror fans are sure to appreciate.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
A bewildering cavalcade of nonsense where nearly every creative decision is either questionable or objectively incorrect.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Red Christmas is a solid, goofy and disturbing slasher that'll have you wary of unannounced visitors during the holidays.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Despite some energy and inventiveness, the film is stuck in a mostly listless zone between taking itself too seriously and having fun with its exploitative elements.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Underneath the warm, if cynical, family sentiment, Red Christmas is a dark and luridly coloured home invasion film.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
A nasty, unpleasant, poorly constructed, and confused movie I was anxious to see end.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Craig Anderson's Red Christmas isn't exactly a lump of coal in your stocking, but neither is it worth waking up early for on the big day.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
One of the most beautifully lit and photographed horror films since Dario Argento's Suspiria.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Mostly, it's a tightly constructed, unapologetically nasty little thriller, given depth and weight by Wallace's interpretation of a sweet woman suffering for her past.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Overall Red Christmas provides much more in the way of balanced perspective and nuance than many a serious drama on the subject.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
""Red Christmas"" avoids complete tastelessness due to Wallace's sincerity, and it's a shame she isn't the sole focus of the film.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Gory and offensive, but lacking in the scare department.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Red Christmas is solely for those horror fans who enjoy cheap, CHEAP thrills and low budget fodder (and hopefully a ton of spiked eggnog).
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
It's not fun. It's not frightening. It's just f*cked.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Craig Anderson doesn't always hit the marks he's aiming for, but he certainly gives his distinctive brand of seasonal, blood-splashed mayhem a spirited try.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Craig Anderson's Red Christmas is more Bob Clark's Black Christmas than Michael Curtiz's White Christmas.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
a calendar slasher... while there is much good humour in the script, you will not be laughing by the end at its deadly serious engagement with a moral dilemma that has plagued the culture wars of the last half-century.
 "
Red Christmas,48,19,critic,"
Red Christmas is just one missed opportunity after the next, and I'm left wishing Anderson had done more with both his story and his characters.

The Rift,,10,audience,"Had to stop watching about 20 minutes in. Horrible acting, horrible dialogue, and horrible, horrible score. The music (If you can call it that) inserted itself into the weirdest moments and was so much louder than the voices, then suddenly cut off  and we're left with the (still low) voices of the actors trying to eek out something resembling drama in this mess of a script. Maybe it got better, but it was too much of a struggle to get there for me."
The Rift,,10,audience,It's as if they got people who have only seen car commercials and buddycop movies and tried to make a sci-fi film
The Rift,,10,audience,"Music track... terrible.  Dialog... lousy.  Acting... just wrong.
I think I lost IQ points watching this."
The Rift,,10,audience,"Predictable and cliche ""plot"".
Shaky hand cam 3rd person shots, bad lightning and scene continuity, bad writing, poor dialogue, poor acting, BAD musical score overlay (seriously, I figured out how to do multiple sound overlays on freeware for you tube and these guys didn't), bad lighting and continuity.
Wasted far to much time trying to finish this instead of just getting off the train wreck after almost 10 minutes of silent/bad music ""introduction"".
So bad I thought this was a Canada/Quebec production."
The Rift,,10,audience,What in the heck did I just watch? This movie was just so bizarre that I could not stop watching. The music score was awful and it was like 2 separate movies in one...... but it was so bad that it was good...... just...... what in the heck did I just watch?
The Rift,,10,audience,This movie is not entertaining and the soundtrack is really annoying.
The Rift,,10,audience,Couldn’t finish. The music was so poorly done it was disturbing. The acting was pretty bad also. 
The Rift,,10,audience,"Not even worth a half star. Terrible acting. terrible sound tract, terrible editing,terrible movie. This movie has no redeeming qualities and I am sorry I watched it. My time was totally wasted.Any body who liked this movie had to be  on drugs in my opinion."
The Rift,,10,audience,"Terrible story, awful acting, and a very bad soundtrack."
The Rift,,10,audience,Couldn't really say what this was about.
The Rift,,10,critic,"
Ultimately, The Rift is an enjoyable and strange tale that's worth a watch when you've got time to kill. Just so long as you don't look too long into the rift itself.

Alien: Reign of Man,,10,audience,"Tubi Trash Review:
""A gifted flight team becomes stranded on an alien planet while attempting to activate a machine that will restore the Earth. During their preparations, they are forced to battle aliens and choose between genocide and extinction."" or so the back of the box says. It spent too much time making pretty pictures and not enough time making sense. The only interesting character is Zan played by Khu (who also produced and did the cinematography). She has some drama and action scenes. The action scenes aren't very good though. She fights a CG monster and it's easy to tell she's fighting the air. There's not much of a beginning, there's no middle, and there's no ending."
Alien: Reign of Man,,10,audience,"Just a number of comments and questions...
Be forewarned that this is a chick flick.
A woman alone in a cave with a dead man being eaten by a muscular alien. She stops, several times in thought, and then strikes at the alien. She stops and thinks again, when she should be killing it, it takes mercy on her and does not kill her. She rewards him with his death by stabbing him with a knife off angle for a killing strike. She is woman, here her roar. 
why.. are.. there.. so.. many.. scenes.. where.. they.. talk.. like.. this..? Doesn't matter it is beyond her comprehension. So, why did they pick her if she is not intelligent enough for the mission?
She has a personal stake in this mission. What convoluted mission is she talking about?
Why does he have an X on his diapered bum? Why is her bum covered?
Why are their shoulder patches the size of billboards?
I swear that guy looks more like a mop in spacesuit than a person.
Wait, let me just sit here contemplating and reminiscing in front of this dangerous alien. Oops, The End.
What the heck did I just watch?"
Alien: Reign of Man,,10,audience,I had no idea what was going on in the entire movie the dialogue sound was so bad. Horrible film. The only good thing was the cute chick at the end and I don't know what happened to her. University Amateurs could've done better.
Alien: Reign of Man,,10,audience,Utter garbage. Couldn't make it through.
Alien: Reign of Man,,10,audience,"This movie was so awfully done. The acting was stilted and so bad it was cringy in every scene. ""We must hurry and get above sea level"" proceede to walk around SLOWLY and move in random directions(actions which does not correlate at all to what they are saying). CGI was laughable. If the acting and directing was better it could have been ignored to be honest. Each character didnt really have a distinctive personality. Although its probably due to the screenwriting, maybe?? But the biggest problem was the endless monologues in nearly every scene. Alas my friends, by the end of the movie you will be left nearly half asleep, confused, questioning why one of the chracters RANDOMLY has a slight british accent out of nowhere, and wondering why this movie was not thoroughly reviewed before being put out to the audience.
Have i mention the bad acting?"
Alien: Reign of Man,,10,audience,"I usually like cheesy Sci-Fi movies, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I kept hoping it would explain something about the why they were doing what they were doing. No characterization. Flashback that aren't explained. And an ending that leaves you wondering why I wasted my time. I gave it one full star because the special effects were good."
Alien: Reign of Man,,10,audience,"I love Sci-Fi movies and I was impressed when I read the synopsis for this film. After about five - ten minutes watching it I felt like I had been suckered. They had all the right ideas for a plot and theme, but the production is top of my worst made movie list. It was a waste of my Red Box inexpensive fee and a waste of my time. If I were involved in this movie in anyway shape or form I would consider a career as far from the movie industry as possible. The ""Alien"" franchise should sue this crew for damages using the popular name recognition to sucker a few Sci-Fi fans like me. Don't rent it. Don't even think of it."
Alien: Reign of Man,,10,audience,"audio out of sync, cgi alien that a highschool student could do better with , scenes where alien is damaged on the right side but in the next is bleeding from the left,
it really looks like a movie put together by a 10 year old with basic knowledge of film making"
Alien: Reign of Man,,10,audience,"Very disappointing. I couldn't get any further than 15 minutes. Horrible everything. The actors, script, wardrobe. Everything... ! It's like they told the actors to make their own costumes. It's so random. What a waste of time."
Alien: Reign of Man,,10,audience,"I love this movie, watched it twice in a row. Recommending it to all my friends ."
Alien: Reign of Man,,10,critic,"
Much like the flicks it's riffing off of, Reign of Man is an interesting installment to sci-fi on the surface that lacks any coherent substance as you dig into its runtime.

For now, this is a film that sadly crumbles under the weight of its own expectations.

Shadowman,95,90,audience,"A decent entertaining documentary.
8.2/10"
Shadowman,95,90,audience,"Must see, haunting, disturbing powerful story of a breakthrough force in NYC and the art world globally. Compare Haring, Basquiat Banksy - or don't even bother.  Just opened at Quad Cinema at 34w13th. https://quadcinema.com/film/shadowman/ Director spoke with audience at 7:30 Dec1 show which was a treat,  (I'll add photos and a clip of that discussion over on Fb at some point.  Cheers.)"
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
It charts the stormy path of a fascinating, enigmatic figure whose art seemed inextricably bound with his self-destructive tendencies.
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
Remarkable for its sweep and its refreshing lack of cant and sentimentality.
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
A more traditional documentary, no less riveting...
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
While the film might make us question the veracity of the story it tells, Shadowman is most intriguing as a record of Hambleton's life that will raise awareness of his work .
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
[Through] video footage, Hambleton shows off his skill at painting these large silhouettes in evocative postures, which he does remarkably quickly.
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
It's not easy to watch. But set to the likes of Talking Heads and Blondie, the documentary succeeds as an unglamorized ode to the uncompromising '80s art scene in New York-and one talented man that it consumed.
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
Director Jacoby doesn't pull his punches in this honest, painful profile.

Shadowman's attempts to deify him as being a brave hero who colored outside the lines or whatever in the denouement rings false.

And yet, the work he is creating was stunning and powerful. The guy still had it.

From critics to historians to past lovers, we become acquainted with a flagrant artist who was at once in love with himself and the images he feverishly created.

 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
An incredibly dramatic documentary, award-winning filmmaker Oren Jacoby's Shadowman is a candid portrait of visual artist Richard Hambleton.
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
This is a gruesome art-world fairy tale unafraid to face the bitter details of its hero's tumultuous life.
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
It's a harrowing movie (towards its end, it feels like we're just watching him fall apart), but a captivating portrait of the modern art world, and the manner in which it repackages and resells its icons.
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
Shadowman is equal parts disturbing and engrossing; it's a film grotesquely morbid yet beautiful, satisfying yet frustrating.
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
Achieves its goal of shining a spotlight on its subject while delivering a fascinating true-life tale.
 "
Shadowman,95,90,critic,"
Jacoby delivers an adroit portrait of the artist at work in a technical package which wraps itself smoothly around this intense, surprising story.

The Price,83,42,audience,"Heartfelt story about a young, Harvard grad,  Nigerian American Wall St. broker whose life is in turmoil.  In the end, not engaging and predictable."
The Price,83,42,critic,"
The Price has a persistent feeling of having been here and done this, but as far as these morality plays are concerned, it's adequate. Ameen gives a strongly empathetic lead performance.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
[The Price] marks the arrival of an exciting new filmmaker in Onah.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
Pointed without ever falling into stereotypes, it's a bold statement about modern immigrant life in America and not to be missed.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
[Flaws] aside, this is an otherwise assured debut that is part social-drama, part corporate thriller, and very watchable as both.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
Smart, well-paced, and a compelling character study, particularly when everything starts to crumble.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
Sure, it's an ages-old dilemma and there are moments that feel very much like a first film. But the strong lead performance by Aml Ameen (""Sense8"") lends shading and depth to Onah's story.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
The Price is best when it lets the characters breathe and exist in space, often with little to no dialogue... Sadly, there's a rhetorical hammer to be swung in The Price, and at times Onah doesn't pull back enough.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
Ameen's performance is heartfelt, yet the film needs more polished insight.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
But the complex overall themes here are dealt with in such abrupt fashion that their treatment ultimately feels superficial. Still, you can hardly indict Onah for trying to make complex themes briskly palatable.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
Writer-director Onah, himself a Nigerian-born artist, understands Seyi through and through. His storytelling is simple but brisk and coherent.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
... the interaction of the film's many tensions nonetheless brings it to complex life.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
Just as ambition eclipses the protagonist's judgment, the movie loses its way in an excess of generic story strands.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
Hopefully this film will be successful and we'll see a more solid sophomore film, but as a debut film Onah should be commended.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
The large amount of plot poses two problems for the fledgling director, in that it's hard to fit all the character and story development into the 90-minute runtime and, as the film progresses, he also finds it difficult to decide where his focus lies.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
Dara Ju doesn't feel groundbreaking, but it feels lived-in and genuine.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
The story ultimately frays apart by tugging at its flimsiest threads, but Onah hits on too many things with too much force for his debut to be dismissed as a result.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
Despite all of Seyi's shortcomings, Dara Ju kept me riveted because I recognized myself in him.
 "
The Price,83,42,critic,"
Overall Dara Ju still delivers on its promise of sharing a piece of the immigrant experience that needs to be told, but much like the film's ambitious protagonist, it loses track of some of the details along the way.
 "
California Typewriter,100,84,audience,"There can be no other movie made with such a deep love of subject and respect for those who share and contribute to that love. A bittersweet examination of time: its passing and its endlessness, its endurance and its ephemeralness, its consistent elusiveness and its chimerical character; and the beautiful souls—quirky, quixotic and qwertyful—who inhabit it."
California Typewriter,100,84,audience,"The little shop depicted was one of those nerve centers where mostly quiet and important work went along rhythmically for over 70 years.  From the essential role it filled from it's beginning to all the modern iterations of the machines within it's walls it never lost sight of purpose, or intensity of dedication to it's customer base.  The family dinner table scene where they voice their responsibilities to the soon-to-be unemployed workers was heart rending in core ethos of the building's owners.  A bona fide piece of Americana at it's best and a soulful tribute of regard for things receding from our collective image.  Great people well-filmed being themselves."
California Typewriter,100,84,audience,"If I could give this more stars, I would. OMG, I loved this so much! Yes, I admit that Tom Hanks was the reason I was even interested in it but wow, what an amazing documentary; probably the best one I've seen in years. It was well done, but not boring, and it was very fascinating. It's been so so long since I've typed on a typewriter and now I find myself wanting to try it just once. We take so much for granted with computers and as a writer, I would love to just put some paper into a typewriter and just type till my heart's content. What an amazing thing that would be. Tom Hanks isn't in this documentary much but I really loved the segments with Sam Shepard (God rest his soul) and John Mayer. Aside from Tom Hanks, John Mayer was my favorite. If I'm in California I want to go to that California Typewriter store and check it out. It looks amazing and it's nice to know it's there. I hope that it's there for a long time. Seriously, everyone should watch this documentary. It's funny and informative and if you've never seen a typewriter orchestra, well, you're really missing out!"
California Typewriter,100,84,audience,"The show was Amazing, I got my first type writer from my neighbor Frederica Pacheco at a very young age to write Poems , Still Admire the Type writer very much..."
California Typewriter,100,84,audience,"Surprisingly entertaining documentary with very likable people. I guess this movie should come with a disclaimer or a warning: This film may show minorities and other Americans saying positive things about the United States. If your one of those people who have a difficult time digesting such things, you should probably skip this film. Otherwise, it's a treat. I'm uncertain why the filmmaker felt the need to validate the theme by interviewing celebrities, but I guess that's the in thing. Trust me, this film is VERY interesting, and celebrates the concept of individualism, innovation, and hard work, from the man who repairs typewriters to the musical act that uses only typewriters."
California Typewriter,100,84,audience,"A very interesting film, I truly enjoyed it. Was surprised about Tom Hanks passion but not surprised about Sam Shepard."
California Typewriter,100,84,audience,"While admittedly a self serving documentary about an anti-technology fad, there is enough genuine quirkiness and cross-stratus interaction to make this interesting to everyone. A little longer than needed, we're taken into the lives of various aficionados to explore a once ubiquitous thing that is today little thought about. The trivia and history tell their own story though it would have been helpful if narration pulled us along for the more psychological aspects of the subjects. Put down your smart phone for a second and realize the way it used to be."
California Typewriter,100,84,audience,"It dips and skims through the world of typewriters, their history, users, artists, fans and lives. It could so easily have gone wrong with self-important talking heads and smug hipsters, but somehow it managed to avoid the pitfalls. Both the staff of ""California Typewriter Shop"" and the typewriter part artist carried this for me, but I was totally intrigued by the concept that using typewriters is akin to the slow food movement in cooking."
California Typewriter,100,84,audience,"Fabulous documentary.  Meditation on creativity and the world of yesterday,  The words of many interviewed here resonated with me."
California Typewriter,100,84,audience,"I'm leaving a negative review because it features Tom Hanks in the first few minutes. This led me to believe it was going to be good and perhaps a cool drama or something. Tom Hanks doesn't feature again, there is no story. It's basically a very dull documentary about typewriters - I got to about 40 minutes in. (And I only lasted that long because I thought Tom Hanks would turn upagain - he doesn't) - don't waste your time, unless you love typewriters"

 "

If California Typewriter slightly overstays its welcome, as Nichol pushes past a natural end point to make the case for manual typewriters as the new vinyl... well, that seems somehow appropriate, too. Love has a way of blinding us to reality, after all.

California Typewriter wanders a bit in its curiosity, but it is hardly a piece of ephemeral nostalgia.
 "
California Typewriter,100,84,critic,"
Suffusing the documentary is an almost religious reverence for this mundane and obsolete mechanical apparatus. Not that it's undeserved.
 "
California Typewriter,100,84,critic,"
A surprisingly thoughtful and beautifully shot film that doubles as both a history of and a love letter to the humble typewriter.
 "
California Typewriter,100,84,critic,"
'California Typewriter' is a very likable, eccentric excursion. It goes deeper than you may at first believe. It will make you look back and reflect on the cost of technology to the mind and the spirit.

California Typewriter,100,84,critic,"
The best thing is that Nichol doesn't adopt a luddite stance. He doesn't try to impart the evils of technology, at least not much.
 "
California Typewriter,100,84,critic,"
One of those documentaries that at first seems like just an enjoyable lark about some eccentric people but winds up raising deeper issues about human needs and the creative process.

Coffin 2,,,audience,It's kind of like a lifetime movie with actors that previously did porn. I'm not sure I can watch this all the way through the red head's acting is making me wish I was born deaf.
Coffin 2,,,audience,This movie is jam packed full of action and suspense with sick and twisted ending! You will not be able to stop watching. It is brilliant!
Coffin 2,,,critic,"
Why belabor yourself with critiques that will only ruin your viewing? Sometimes you just have to save your breath, press play, and pray you make it through without laughing until you cry. Which, honestly may be the best way to watch this movie.
 "
Coffin 2,,,critic,"
Coffin 2 is a decent enough follow-up to its predecessor, but is bogged down by too many characters and is overall just a little too clever for its own good.

Resisterhood,100,100,audience,"I've been an on again off again activist since coming of age in the late 60s and was devastated when HRC lost. This film authentically captures the mood of women of my generation moved to act as if muscle memory kicked in, as well as the awakening of a new generation, many of whom thought there was no need for women to fight."
Resisterhood,100,100,audience,Great and inspiring film! I recommend watching!
Resisterhood,100,100,audience,"Resisterhood will make you cry at times from anger, joy and sometimes pure sweetness but it will leave you uplifted and inspired to get involved and make the world a better place. In this time when the constant drumbeat of lies, grifting and division often leaves us feeling powerless, this film will leave you feeling uplifted, engaged and empowered. Resisterhood is a story for our time and beautifully captures the newfound engagement of millions of women in the political process."
Resisterhood,100,100,audience,"Resisterhood delivers a positive message of hope and empowerment that resonates in these difficult times. It is told through the stories of women called to action for the common good. They are your neighbors, your book club buddies, and they are you. Be inspired by their stories."
Resisterhood,100,100,audience,"This is the story of five diverse characters and their fight for the rights to vote, equality and personal freedoms in a country that has swung to the right. The film weaves these stories into a tapestry that shows what drives them and what they do for others. One has a history linking them with the Selma March to Montgomery with MLK and John Lewis. One has an ancestor, who marched to the White House in 1913 as a suffragette and created a group protesting injustice. One was a House of Representative Congressman, who spoke against gun violence and kids in cages and was arrested for his values. One is a new citizen from Egypt, who ran and won for Rockville City council. One was a professional soccer player, who became the Rainbow Warrior and after her injury became an inspirational speaker. The whole project is very well done and a historical document showing what Democracy Looks Like!"
Resisterhood,100,100,audience,Resisterhood created by brilliant filmmaker CJ Crim made me laugh and cry as it took me on a Powerful time travel journey of our nation as it rises up to reclaim its soul and move forward in unity. Not to be missed!!!!! Great Zoom party movie!!
Resisterhood,100,100,audience,"It would seem that the country is about to be saved by women voting against the madness of this unhinged president.  The Resisterhood documentary tells this story, literally from Day One, in the very best tradition of American journalism.  The film is making a difference today by inspiring us to vote.  It will continue to make a difference, perhaps for generations, by having documented what happened and how women stood up and made their voices heard."

Resisterhood shines brightest when it focuses not just on the growing activism in the last four years, but as an immediate call to action.

The infectious, focused energy of these and other women, all ages, rouses the viewer, provides hope when all seems lost; gives to those who cannot speak for themselves a symbolic microphone.

Resisterhood is meant to highlight the power of women, hope, and resistance in American politics. It succeeds at these goals...

Skin Game,,54,audience,"Great comedy, very well played and directed, and after more than 40 years, it still works totally and that's what is so impressive. I just don't understand why it is still not regarded as a classic, because I've just discovered it today and it's already one of my favorite along with the best of Lubitsch, Wilder, or Mel Brooks (though even it Blazing Saddles is also a western comedy, the humour is quite different from it, and Skin Game is closest to Wilder comedies in my opinion)"
Skin Game,,54,audience,"It was fine, but certainly could not touch garners other work."
Skin Game,,54,audience,good western satire and WB's 2000th film!
Skin Game,,54,audience,A  salt-n-pepper con-man team makes for a funny western. (It's kind of a comedy roots movie)
Skin Game,,54,audience,Dated but a pretty good movie.
Skin Game,,54,audience,Great old comedy made in 1971 with James Garner and Louis Gossett Jr.
Skin Game,,54,audience,"James Garner and a young Lou Gossett, Jr. play a couple of con men who scam slave owners by selling Lou Gossett at auction, then breaking him out later. It's funny, but disturbing at the same time with its depiction of slave ownership, slave pens, and the like. It's a good film; definitely worth a viewing."
Skin Game,,54,audience,Amusing comedy set in the west is helped a great deal by the chemistry of the three leads. Garner is the center that makes the whole thing go and he plays well with both Gossett and Susan Clark. It moves at a nice lively clip and while there are a few serious moments they never get in the way of the overall breeziness of the film.
Skin Game,,54,audience,"ENJOYABLE COMEDY WESTERN, FUN FOR THE MOST PART. A PERFECT ROLE FOR GARNER."
Skin Game,,54,critic,"
Beneath the jovial and slapstick surface, though, there's a more serious movie here that's willing to explore the consequences of this unusual pairing.
 "
Skin Game,,54,critic,"
Garner has the characterization of lovable rascal down to a science.

Palm Springs,94,88,audience,"Palm Springs is a 2020 American science fiction romantic comedy film directed by Max Barbakow 🏝 

It's ok, but I feel mixed about this one 😉
I'd recommend it if you like this genre, but if not then probably give it a miss 👍🏼👎🏼"
Palm Springs,94,88,audience,"Genuinely funny and always stays interesting. Unfortunately, Samberg isn't the strongest actor in my opinion. Some of his lines feel like a retread of every classic slacker comedy character. The funny parts are actually funny, with slapstick not relied upon and a decent amount of creativity on show despite the obvious Groundhog Day connections. However, the romance works well enough (though Cristin Milioti's performance is of a similar level to Samberg's) and the slightly lackadaisical approach to setting up the rules of the time loop doesn't distract. Ultimately just a really pleasant experience despite its shortcomings."
Palm Springs,94,88,audience,"Good for some decent laughs,"
Palm Springs,94,88,audience,Totally unexpected movie. It was great!
Palm Springs,94,88,audience,What a surprise! Palm Springs is now one of my favorite films. No room for improvement. Perfect delivery of a solid script.
Palm Springs,94,88,audience,"Palm Springs has nice ingredients and is definitely likeable, but somehow the sum of all of its components doesn't make it as compelling as one could have expected."
Palm Springs,94,88,audience,"Despite wrinkles, I felt like I'd seen this shtick before.  I was bored."
Palm Springs,94,88,audience,"Świetna komedia z niezwykłą chemią pomiędzy protagonistami. Może i motyw dnia świstaka jest oklepany, jednak tutaj dobrze go wykorzystano i przedstawiono.

Palm Springs,94,88,audience,"Palm Springs is by far Andy Samberg's best work!  Samberg and Milioti have amazing on screen chemistry, and they bring plenty of laughs throughout!

Palm Springs,94,88,audience,An amazing take on the day loop story idea. The chemistry between the actors is stupendous
Palm Springs,94,88,critic,"
It would be easy to dismiss Palm Springs as a Groundhog Day rip-off. It would also be myopic, misguided, and moronic.

The filmmakers use the hook of the time-loop to do some clever, creative things they could not do were this just some linear movie set at a Palm Springs wedding.
 "

A fun film that unintentionally speaks to the COVID era - anxiety, depression and that feeling that no matter what you do, you can't escape yourself. The good news is that, in this movie anyway, there's a cure for that.

This is a complex story about love and emotional growth in a strange and seemingly hopeless situation which nonetheless is similar to the human condition we all share. As a time-loop romantic comedy, it ranks right up there with ""Groundhog Day.""
 "
Palm Springs,94,88,critic,"
In the time-honoured tradition of Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, Chris Rock or Kristin Wiig, [Andy] Samberg here proves himself very capable of merging his comedic talents with something more dramatic and tragic.

[The introspective drama's] emotional and psychological revelations will always be undercut by comedy, but they're no less effective for it.
 "
Palm Springs,94,88,critic,"
You could revisit [this film] many times. It's also difficult to imagine a film that better encapsulates the loopy feeling of living through a pandemic, minus the fear. It's one of the best and brightest things to come out of this benighted year.

High Flying Bird,91,50,audience,"I'll admit my bias right up front - I love basketball.   So, to see a story loosely based on the 2011 NBA lockout was interesting.  To see a story with a ""behind the scenes"" look, actual interview snippets with NBA players, a gym in south Bronx teaching youngsters the game, all of it was enjoyable.  Do you have to be a basketball nut to enjoy this story?  I don't think so, but it helps."
High Flying Bird,91,50,audience,"Soderbergh's latest iphone romp is political talkfest with a real lack of shooting hoops.
I can not stress enough how little basketball is played in this film.  And I cannot stress enough how much talking there is.  It's more like a gangster or heist film with lots of powerful people endlessly talking at each other.  And in the end it is a heist."
High Flying Bird,91,50,audience,What a great and timely movie!  Bravo!  A pleasure with witty dialogue and great production values.
High Flying Bird,91,50,audience,Very entertaining for basketball fans and fans of sports business.
High Flying Bird,91,50,audience,"A thoughtful and compelling sports drama with an impressive cinematography, clever editing, a poignant and talented direction, and compelling performances."
High Flying Bird,91,50,audience,"As a Soderbergh movie, it falls flat, disappoints, and only makes me wanna stay away from his more rotten/ill received movies; While it may be good for passing time on your apple device while watching anime or a prestige show, but I'm with the audience on this one."
High Flying Bird,91,50,audience,"There seems to be a big disconnect between the critics and other reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes on this movie. I didn't find it appealing at all. I think the screenplay needed more work. I didn't know what was going on through a lot of it, and I'm well-versed in the NBA. I'm not sure what this was about: an agent trying to hang onto his clients, the culture of a lockout, a young basketball player trying to find his way? I don't know what the interviews with the actual players really added. I found myself bored most of the time."
High Flying Bird,91,50,audience,Did anything even happen? Snoozefest.
High Flying Bird,91,50,audience,"Now just as I've lost faith in Soderbergh he comes along and puts me right back in my place. It helps that the firecracker whipsmart script by Moonlight's Tarell Alvin McCraney, and the bravura, smooth-talking, wise-cracking central performance by André Holland are just totally in sync.
It's a gripping 70's era feeling, but very ultra-modern looking sports drama, but unlike most, it's not flabby, instead it's lyrical, brisk and tight.
I really enjoyed this film and it's dynamism and completeness. Plus it's got a message. Soderbergh is making a new kind of PSA, a new way of igniting a revolution with cheap, fast and solidly entertaining think-pieces. And that in itself is a quiet revolution in film form."
High Flying Bird,91,50,audience,"Interesting movie about the behind the scenes of NBA during a lockout season. For such a subject the plot is engaging and dialogue witty. Great acting by André Holland, Sonja Sohn, Melvin Gregg and others."
High Flying Bird,91,50,critic,"
High Flying Bird is much colder, at times even clinical, and it's more interested in the long-term work of resistance than heist plots and celebrations.

High Flying Bird is [Soderbergh's] anarchist's cookbook for besting capitalist systems and getting narratives out into the light that they would keep in darkness.

In typical Soderbergh fashion, High Flying Bird is a film about basketball featuring no games of basketball, and a thriller that derives its suspense from the fast-paced, rhythmic dialogue of Tarrel Alvin McCraney.

A thoughtful, cerebral entry in this black renaissance period.

The script is fantastic... It plays almost like an Ocean's 11 movie.
 "
High Flying Bird,91,50,critic,"
McCraney understands rhythm and melody. His dialogue has real musicality, and these actors -- this cast is so good -- deliver their lines accordingly; they know when to lean into the beat, when to sotto voce, when to sound the timpani.
 "
High Flying Bird,91,50,critic,"
While focusing on the nuts and bolt of big-time athletics, Soderbergh misses the drama and urgency inherent in his high-flying, high-stakes subject matter.
 "
High Flying Bird,91,50,critic,"
High Flying Bird could be called an anti-Sports Movie: its goal is not to uplift, but rather to provoke, mobilize and envision a future in which the players themselves own the league.
 "
High Flying Bird,91,50,critic,"
When screenplays are as psychologically rich and dexterously constructed as McCraney's, you have to think twice about assigning total creative ownership to the films' directors.
 "
High Flying Bird,91,50,critic,"
Soderbergh and his writer take what could be a solid sports drama and restructure it as an exciting con movie.
 "
High Flying Bird,91,50,critic,"
The actors here, particularly Holland, speak with a relish Soderbergh usually saves for his heist capers. And though much lighter on the action, High Flying Bird still has the pace and feel of one.

Django Unchained,87,91,audience,"The Fastest Gun in the South: Django Unchained 

Quentin Tarantino's impressive directing power in Django Unchained brings you two hours of light humor, intense violence and emotional drama. While Django Unchained is profane, provocative and raunchy, it also demonstrates an ability to unravel America's legacy of slavery through a suspenseful plot. 

What makes Django Unchained so great is its ability to combine various different film genres into one movie. It fits revisionist western, adventure, romance, dark comedy and drama genres. Tarantino's use of dark comedy and violence in Django Unchained and his other movies resembles Stanley Kubrick's style, particularly in A Clockwork Orange. Both Tarantino and Kubrick's movies could fit countless genres as they capture the archetype of conflict between good and evil. 

The cinematography is excellent, and the film does a strong job of capturing the slaves' perspectives. The first harrowing moments of the film show slaves walking all day with sweat dripping all over their faces and limping with huge cuts on their backs. Then the film takes off with a bloody moment 7 minutes in (a Tarantino classic). Right away, the audience is shocked by close-up shots of the inhumane conditions Django and the other slaves had to endure. 

Both main characters in Django Unchained want something: Dr. Schultz, a bounty hunter, wants the financial reward of killing outlaws, and Django just wants to rescue his wife from slavery. The film's social commentary aims to answer this question: What do humans need to be happy? One can see this theme through the journeys of the characters. Calvin Candie (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) gains false happiness through evil means such as exploiting other people, while Django seeks the true happiness of love.

Dr. Schultz foreshadows the plot when he explains an ancient German fairytale to Django. The story is about a German princess who is sent off to stay on the top of a mountain and is guarded by a dragon. A knight eventually kills the dragon and saves her. Django presents a similar story, but when presented through the harsh realities of slavery, the story takes on more powerful levels of meaning. Overall, Django Unchained is a true cinematic masterpiece and I give it an A+."
Django Unchained,87,91,audience,"A perfect combination of humor, action, thrill and drama. Quentin’s best work. "
Django Unchained,87,91,audience,"Tarantino flicks can sometimes feel like they're trying too hard (Hateful Eight) but this was right among his best to me. I'd rank it up there with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Inglorious Basterds. There's a ton of style here, the violence is just what it called for, and it doesn't over rely on dialogue. Plus, the performances are all fantastic with Waltz and DiCaprio being the best. This movie is a blast and the near-three hour runtime flies by."
Django Unchained,87,91,audience,Out of all the Tarantino movies this one ranks number one as my personal favorite. Its just what you would expect from a Tarantino movie all the blood and awesome dialouge but what makes me love this one the most is the performances from Jamie foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio. A must see for Tarantino fans and cinema lovers in general.

Django is another example of Tarantino looking at cultural American history through the lens of privilege, twisting truth and fiction through a grotesque, funhouse mirror.

Django Unchained is bold, hysterical, entertaining, brutal and daring, it is another masterpiece from the present-master of the western, Quentin Tarantino.

12 Years a Slave,95,90,audience,"The persuasion against immorality

It is always a challenge to analyse a movie about such irrational logic, especially the one that has preserved its vicious footprint in todays society. Solomon is one of many black men that have endured and suffered way too much for far too long. Therefore, his brave story finally got told in this sheer narrative craftsmanship: 12 years a slave. 


Solomon went from a musically, habitual daily life to twelve years of unimaginable slavery. Even with the necessary documents that prooved he was a free man; he could not prove his right to be free and got framed. During these twelve years of being a slave, he got no free passes and had to deal with the hard labour, the whips, the absence of his family and much more. A free man, who could not even choose where he stood.


Over the years, Solomon got to meet many slaves and free people. Naturally, he looked at them as his hope to freedom. However, every time he wanted to trust someone, there was always more chance to add insult to injury rather than opening the doors for his freedom. It was a little typical that Brad Pitt in his cameo, was the white man that came up for the injustice around him. On the other hand, we have William Ford. He was more of an example of someone that was between accepting the irrational voice of the white supremacy and coming up for Solomon. Though he was a helping hand towards Solomon on a few occasions, even if it was as little as a helium atom.


The element of nudity was elevated to a new height. The mere fact that the black people in this movie got sold and whipped naked is striking. Instead of nudity 
being used as an erotic factor or a comedic one, it was used as an important detail to help us understand the inhuman things these people had to go through a little more. 
The writer wanted us to observe every detail of the black history. Completely naked in a human selling gallery that separates calves from their parents, their family and homes. A place that divorces you from your right, breath, sense, alternatives and soul. It was hard to watch it without crying or having goosebumps. (SPOILER ALERT) But at long last, his story didn't get down in infinite flames. Solomon survived.


There are always things that we want to change about movies. Like a happy end or a sanction for the bad guys or maybe a scene that could repeat itself as if we never saw it, so we could feel the happiness of that moment again as if it was the first time. I wish like nothing else to change things from the movie. To add justice and punishments, but unfortunately it was a true history. Yet: ‘There are no menus, you will get served what you deserve.' 
It is to us now to learn from these horrifying actions made against these black men, so we can never roll in a time like that again.




Steve McQueen is a brilliant mind, and he told this story to the best of his ability. He got praised with an Oscar which he rightfully earned. He made a piece that was hard on the nerves, a piece that summoned a lot of emotions while watching it. Even with racism still being a huge problem in today's society, it is with certainty that I can say that every person watching this movie was cheering Solomon on and hoping for his freedom. And eventually… he was once again, a free man. A free man by                       his persuasion against immorality."
12 Years a Slave,95,90,audience,Was a bit long and dragged out at points but overall great movie. Pretty much a must see.

12 Years a Slave,95,90,audience,My sadistic and masochistic sides would be strong if I say that I enjoyed it. So I can't but its a brilliant visual ride.
12 Years a Slave,95,90,audience,"This is a movie that I will likely never watch ever again, but it is a masterpiece. Remember all those slavery movies they showed us in school? This movie puts those to shame with its brutal albeit real look into what slavery was like, and it makes you feel like a scumbag during every scene. The performances all around are phenomenal; Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita N'yongo, Sarah Paulson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt, the list goes on. Also, the direction and the camerawork is flawless. I do have one very small issue with the film, and that is the fact that it doesn't feel like a span of 12 years; it felt more like a couple of years. But, that is a such a small thing in this incredible but depressing look into slavery. It's not an easy watch at all, but if you haven't seen this movie, do so."
12 Years a Slave,95,90,audience,The performance of Lupita Nyong'o earns this movie 5 stars.
12 Years a Slave,95,90,audience,Poorly directed and uneven acting.
12 Years a Slave,95,90,audience,"Based on a contemporaneous account written in the 1850s. Taken by force from a happy family and comfortable life in New York the protagonist finds himself traded to a cotton farmer in America's south. The at-times almost ‘normal' life of the slaves on a plantation with dances and Sundays off is contrasted with the horrendous cruelty meted out by the masters. Disappointed, violated and betrayed at every turn our hero tries to navigate the world he has been plunged into. Some great acting but overall the film feels stiff and didn't  really surprise or move this viewer."
12 Years a Slave,95,90,audience,The movie is very violent but it's supposed to because of the story its telling. The movie is great and I recommend it.
12 Years a Slave,95,90,audience,The story is superb. It helped me learn a lot about the past. I'm not very convinced by the acting. Something feels missing. What unfolds is morbid but the performance does not live up to the plot.

Any understanding of slavery as a historical phenomenon is absent, despite the occasional reference to slaves as property.

In 12 Years a Slave, Solomon Northup's story is tragic and infuriating, but only because slavery itself was tragic and infuriating. Beyond that, the story feels generic.

The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,69,audience,"A film with a very specific, fresh voice. It's at some point relatable, funny, personal, and intimate. The black and white cinematography adds a deeper, unique special sense of reality, the editing is just gorgeous, and Radha Blank and Peter Y. Kim couldn't have more chemistry on the screen.

An encouraging and authentic story about following your dreams and living the life you want to live. Refreshingly uplifting and fun."
The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,69,audience,It is refreshing to see a movie focusing on a middle aged woman from a marginalized background.  It is the story of how her midlife crisis plays out.  I also like that it takes place in parts of NYC that rarely show up in films.  And it has some great rap going on.
The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,69,audience,"I really liked this! The humor was really witty and actually made me laugh. It did feel slow at some point in the middle, but I was thoroughly engaged."
The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,69,audience,Radha Blank's The 40-Year-Old Version is very powerful!!!
The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,69,audience,"This movie was Horrifyingly Bad. Not the Acting, the Direction or the structure of the movie, the content was Racist. It's a shame the movie might have been very good but Radha Blank wanted everyone to know that the White Man was the cause of All of her Problems. It's Whitey's Fault. Her character is a down on her luck New York City Playwright. Her Bad Luck follows her around like a Shadow. Unfortunately her problems aren't luck but are a result of magnificently Bad decisions on her part. Its interesting the Movie walks you through all of her Bad decisions but her conclusion is that the White Man is holding her down. The White Man is keeping her from being her Authentically Black self. At one point in the movie she Chokes out the White Man to try and Rid herself of these Demons. In the End of the Movie she finally gets the Big Broadway Break she's worked so tirelessly to obtain. But wait instead of graciously accepting the Fruits of her labor, she raises her skirt and Craps all over the White establishment that forced her to ""Sell Out"". After that she is finally able to throw everything in her life away and become a ""Real"" Black person,"
The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,69,audience,"Really enjoyable. Funny, full of heart... a realer view of the theater world than I've ever seen in a movie before. Plus really wonderful to see this perspective, from Radha who has lived it herself. The musical moments were great as well."
The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,69,audience,"When a 39-year-old playwright's career has woefully stalled for a decade, what does she do to get it back on track before turning 40? She decides to reinvent herself and become a rapper, one whose works reflect the views of a 40-year-old plus-size single Black woman struggling to get by -- and with hilarious (and I do mean hilarious) results at that. The debut feature from writer-actor-director Radha Blank is one of the most refreshingly honest comedies to come along in quite some time, serving up big laughs throughout its two-hour runtime while simultaneously offering poignant insights about the New York arts community, society at large, being authentic and growing older. The narrative becomes admittedly a little stretched out in the second hour, but, with everything else it has to offer, who cares? Sensitive viewers are cautioned that the salty language in this one is enough to make a sailor blush, but it only serves to make the laughs even bigger throughout. Blank is off to a tremendous start with this project; let's hope she keeps it up in future releases."
The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,69,audience,Looks like a lot of the audience reviewers (68%??)  we're looking to see a movie about gentrification!
The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,69,audience,"Occasionally funny, but mostly childish. I mean, if you're almost 40, can't you declare your artistic integrity without being obnoxious or mean about it? The tiebreaker for whether you like this or not might turn on how you feel about freestyling and battle rhyming."
The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,69,audience,"Partially autobiographic empowering tale, partially tongue-in-cheek mid life crisis fairy tale, partially hopeful homage to the courage to discover yourself, 'The Forty-Year Old Version' is one of this year's most underrated films.

Radha Blank, a stagnating, once prolific talented Broadway playwright tells the story of Radha Blank, a stagnating, once prolific Broadway playwright trying to reinvent herself as a rapper on the existentially dreadful eve of her 40th birthday. The resulting film is gloriously energetic, funny and relevant, so Radha Blank did manage to reinvent herself as a powerful filmmaker and a voice to be attentively followed in the future.

Her New York is gorgeously shot in black and white, her supporting cast is realistic, and her on-screen love story is unexpectedly believable. Inspiring without being cheesy, 'The Forty-Year Old Version' knocks everyone out with its infectious ""day by day struggle"" energy and insights into the New York theater and rap scenes."

Sometimes Always Never,82,68,audience,"Impressive visually and comedically successful at points. Can't help but feel as if the performances were subdued and the characters not as charming as they clearly hoped to make them. The visuals are honestly the most notable thing, when I think in most films they should be supplementary. I don't think that style is a substitute for substance in this case, despite there being enough substance for a somewhat satisfying experience. At its core it is too earnest to take serious issue with, so one cannot be too harsh. Nighy does alright as a quiet yet eccentric father, but some aspects of his performance felt very average, although this could have been the writing."
Sometimes Always Never,82,68,audience,"A very quirky, dry comedy with some slightly dark themes.  The film stars Bill Nighy as a family man, a sometime tailor, and always a Scrabble enthusiast.  Scrabble hustler or Scrabble addict' may be more appropriate terms.  The dry comedy style is intended to catch the audience off guard.  While this movie may not appear promising to most, it may pleasantly surprise many."
Sometimes Always Never,82,68,audience,"It was just too knowingly light-touch to be convincing. Contrived whimsy like this is just plain annoying - typical of which was the driving scenes, which were knowingly dated, and unreal in their use of background film with actors sat in the studio-based, stationary car. It looked like what it was - an attempt to make a quirky virtue out of a lack of budget. It was just too convenient, and it made me feel sorry for the producers.
The whole thing, which could have been rescued by an engaging plot, was no more than a picaresque odyssey, lacking heft, and the sad thing about saying that, is that in the right hands, you feel that something could have been done with this."
Sometimes Always Never,82,68,audience,"Words can be powerful.  So this is about a father (Bill Nighy) who has lost his son years back.  There wasn't a horrible accident or anything; the boy just walked out on his family and never returned after an argument over Scrabble.  This story is about the father trying to track down his son with no leads while reconnecting with the family that he does have.  Now I am a big fan of Bill Nighy, so I was looking forward to this.  He has never made a project worse by having his name added to the cast list, but it is almost always supporting, not front and center.  He seldom gets cast in roles where he is the lead, and let me tell you: I am pleased to get that here.  I don't think that this movie is perfect, but it does have its strengths.  For starters, I highly enjoyed the premise.  It may be my particular tastes, but it makes me laugh to no end: somebody getting heated over a board game to the point where they walk out of the room and just never come back.  I also appreciated Nighy in this.  Sure, he isn't playing this overly different from the roles you've seen him in previously, but he is still a lovable rascal, and that is infectious.  He causes friction by just being himself with his particular personality, and because there is conflict, you want to see how this is going to play out.  I also loved how he wasn't afraid to confront his son who isn't missing, played here by Sam Riley; it is so rare to see somebody get called out for being passive-aggressive, it was refreshing to watch it here.  Sometimes, Always, Never is an enjoyable little film, and that is my biggest critique: it is small in scope.  It is a somewhat quirky indie movie, and if you enjoy Wes Anderson, you will probably like this, albeit to a lesser extent.  The story is personable, but I don't know how long I will retain from this one after the fact.  It has charm and would likely be a great movie to watch with your parents.  I know it might be confusing for this to have a wide release in the same calendar year as Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always, but I still give them both recommendations."
Sometimes Always Never,82,68,audience,"A minor key movie to be sure, and vetty English, but at its cold center is a warm heart that revolves around a Scrabble board."
Sometimes Always Never,82,68,audience,By the time the emotional heft of the film takes place I was left wondering how a movie obsessed with Scrabble could get something as simple as two-letter words so wrong.  If you can get over that minor detail you'll be better off then someone who thinks it's a disqualifying detail.  Bill Nighy plays a father who is often conniving. He cheats.  He tricks a man out of 200 quid.  He's not all that likable and when you're asked to feel sympathetic for him you're gonna question why you'd want to.  Alice Lowe is mostly wasted as is the majority of the supporting cast.  Final Score: 4.4/10
Sometimes Always Never,82,68,audience,Wonderful quirky character study. Great cast plus...Scrabble!
Sometimes Always Never,82,68,audience,love the subtlety of love and family...
Sometimes Always Never,82,68,audience,"A bit slow and uneventful, only good thing about it is Bill Nighy who can turn an unpleasant premise into something light and comedic. The cinematography and direction is heavily borrowed from Wes Anderson."
Sometimes Always Never,82,68,audience,"Never never never miss a Bill Nighy performance. Always always always right in character, no matter the genre. Sometimes manic (Pirate Radio, otter pirate movies), sometimes devious, sometimes romantic, and here, in Sometimes Always Never , he's all of that and more. A thoughtful, quirky film about family struggles, joys and Scrabble words."
Sometimes Always Never,82,68,critic,"
A small film about big topics that balances an overarching feel of sorrow with heavy doses of whimsy. Eloquent both visually and emotionally, it speaks volumes about heartbreak even when the characters can't quite find the words to do so themselves.

Sometimes Always Never is a sweet, soulful film about family...the retro vividity of the proceedings brings forth a very specific vibe - think Wes Anderson if he was making movies in the '70s...a seven-letter bingo of a film.

While the film's stylized visuals make it pop and the performances are sympathetic and pleasant, the story is too ephemeral to make much of a mark.

Carl Hunter's quirky drama puts a lot of interesting pieces on the board, but can't put them together into something coherent.

On the surface, this strange film could leave you thinking that not much actually happened... but it's the idiosyncratic emotional journey, expertly portrayed by Nighy and the ensemble, rather than the destination that sticks with you.

What the film does sustain, and quite remarkably, considering its serious theme, is a delicately comic tone. That's due in large measure to the screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce.

Many of the constituent parts are there, but they never quite cohere and so the result is something that's unfocused and more than a little frustrating.

Rao demonstrates a lightness of touch and a very Bollywood knack for melodrama and entertainment that should make the work appealing to both domestic and international audiences...

It is the animation technique that is the knockout in Gitanjali Rao's Bombay Rose.

Even by the standards of artisan arthouse animation - a realm as far removed from Disney as mumblecore is from Marvel - it's quite a vision.

RIP PORKY"
Dead Pigs,96,49,audience,"The Chinese title of Cathy Yan's 2018 debut feature means 'City floating on the Sea', which is both a lyrical and literal translation of Shanghai and gives you an idea of what the film's intentions are. Now available on streaming after Birds of Prey's success last year, you'll see narrative structural similarities which explains why DC tapped her for the later film. Assured, accomplished, and reminding me of Mike Leigh infused with the quirky sense of the Coen Brothers, this is set in a rapidly sprawling and modernizing Shanghai city and revolves around a bunch of initially disparate characters: a brash farmer, a larger-than-life salon owner, a lonely busboy, a sad rich girl and a dislocated American architect, that are somehow connected with a property development scheme, which symbolizes progress in Chinese society, but tainted with a sense of tacky decadence. Inspired by a real life event when thousands of dead pigs mysteriously float down the Huangpu river, this serves as a springboard to a bunch of stories in which everyone's faking it to keep up with the ever changing times. Yan's beautiful and meaningful compositions are accompanied by a delightfully soothing score that nicely juxtaposed with an increasingly pulsating narrative pace that the film crescendos into. I do believe that there's a sense of lost in subtitles here and native Shanghaiese speakers (not Mandarin) will find more affinity and nuance to this film than non-speakers. Likewise, people more in tune with Chinese culture will get more from this while others might find it more bewildering. Either way, there's an edgy rawness to the film as not everything hangs perfectly together but there's undeniable charm and plenty of heart here, despite an ending that perhaps tries too hard to find a positive spot for every main character to land on."
Dead Pigs,96,49,audience,"0.74 laughs/min. 

4.7% of movie spent tense. 

Cathy Yan's directorial debut is a wonderful dramedy grounded in the ramifications of modernization, consumer capitalism, and decadence in modern day China."
Dead Pigs,96,49,audience,"Watched on Mubi yesterday,  I loved it in so many ways really gave an nuance and entertaining view of modern urbanisation in China"
Dead Pigs,96,49,audience,"Dead Pigs is a disappointing directorial debut for Cathy Yan. And by all mean I don’t think it’s her fault as a director. Her direction is stylish and engaging. I completely understand how she was chosen to direct Birds of Prey based off this. The thing is, the story just didn’t hook me. The film juggles multiple storylines with varying quality. Also contrary to Birds of Prey, the pacing is very slow. There are some interesting moments, particularly towards the beginning and end, but in between it just get boring. Overall, I didn’t love this as much as most did. It just didn’t click with me. It might to you, but it didn’t overly with me. "
Dead Pigs,96,49,audience,"A must-watch... I totally fell in love with Candy's character. The best one by far. 
It feels uncomfortably close to reality when it comes to daily struggles that everyone deals with and tries to throw by the river by saying ""I'm fine"". (Did you see what I did there?)"
Dead Pigs,96,49,audience,Great Satire! I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE AUDIENCE IS PANNING IT. Vivian wu and Mason Lee particularly shine
Dead Pigs,96,49,audience,Funny movie with a good story and well acted.
Dead Pigs,96,49,audience,"Dead Pigs was a movie that I was really looking forward to seeing, but it let me down in a big way. The film follows four storylines that are supposed to mix together but do so very weakly. The first is about a woman who won't sell her house to a company looking to build a large living space. The second is about her brother who needs to come up with some money to pay back a loan shark who's money he lost in a fraudulent investment. The third is a love story between the brother's son who is so poor that he's getting hit by cars and extorting money to get by and a girl who's father is extremely rich. The fourth storyline is about a white architect in China who takes a job as a semi-model. Each storyline had me invested at least a little bit in each of these characters, and I expected a satisfying conclusion in the end that would bring all these characters together in some way. I didn't get that at all. What I got was a sing-along scene with all the characters and extras as they performed some weird choreography. You know how at the end of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" they literally do a ""cop out""? Well this felt like that except worse. The only reason I'm giving this movie 1 1/2 stars instead of 0 is because there were some cool moments in the film, and it had some beautiful shots in it as well."
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
Yan fashions a quirky, engaging and feisty tale that unites the plights of kooky characters coping with an ever-changing city, country and culture. It's quite the ride.

Dead Pigs delivers a story that is thought-provoking, decadently stylish, sprightly poignant, and joltingly funny.
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
Some directors look on the loneliness and soullessness of modern life and despair. Cathy Yan giggles.

Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
The result is an ensemble piece that is quirky and funny as it is compelling and gritty.
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
A work of ebullient satire and quietly stirring humanism, as well as a trenchant study of China's frenetic modernization as a horror show in progress, one that's every bit the equal of America's own late-capitalist nightmare.
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
A unique and idiosyncratic work which served to put an exciting filmmaker firmly on the map.
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
Yan's debut as a writer/director is a mostly sturdily constructed, and deftly edited, series of 'meanwhiles,' a sprawling narrative of loosely and closely connected people whose lives intertwine in a variety of ways.
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
Dead Pigs is a charming, quirky, and unique directorial debut from Cathy Yan and is another sign of her promising future in cinema.
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
Dead Pigs's intermingling of grit and polish is hugely satisfying: a potent combination of pearls and swine.

A great first feature from Cathy Yan, Dead Pigs paints a vivid backdrop of globalization, wealth inequality, and the anxieties of a dual Eastern and Western existence.
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
It's a tonal wild ride with eccentric characters, neon-lit settings and elaborately absurd detours. Unfortunately, the ripped-from-the-headlines meat of ""Dead Pigs"" gets lost in these affectations.

Thoroughly enjoyable, ""Dead Pigs"" arises as the origin chapter of a great storyteller and an opportune mosaic of people in a rapidly transforming superpower.

A bold social satire that never loses its sense of fun, Dead Pigs finally lets us confirm what Birds Of Prey already suggested: Cathy Yan has a sharp eye and a fearless voice - we're lucky to have her.
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
Pigs is an unassuming topical entertainment, but diverting and well-acted.
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
It's a film that keeps on peeling back layers and which ultimately feels rather touching in its unstereotypical view of humanity.
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
Yan's characters, regardless of which side of the social hierarchy they fall on, are layered and feel like real people rather than caricatures.

Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
Dead Pigs is an acerbic commentary on modern China, wrapped in an absurdist comedy and an oddball family drama
 "
Dead Pigs,96,49,critic,"
It is bitingly satirical, trenchantly observant, and features a cast of characters that runs the entire social gamut. It is also deeply rooted in actual, documented events.

Jallikattu,96,,audience,"Jallikattu is a mad, loud, violent, visually stunning film by a truly amazing director, Lijo Jose Pelissery. 

However, I do feel like it is overindulgent I'm a few ways. Some scenes could've been cut down, and the ending, the last scene of the film with the Neanderthals wasn't necessary. I got the point he was trying to make. 

Besides that, very, very well made and beautifully acted mad cap of a film."
Jallikattu,96,,audience,"You will never hate your whole species more than while watching Jallikattu. Humans here are the animals and they are the brutal beasts that need to be feared. This Indian film isn't just about animal cruelty, but it's also about the intrinsically animalistic behavior of all males, even human males, and how pronounced and dangerous it can get when bolstered with mob mentality. It is over-the-top, but it's also very much true. The movie presents this very heightened experience in atmosphere and visuals that is also kinetic and technically brilliant in its every frame."
Jallikattu,96,,audience,"Probably the toughest movie ever made in Mollywood!

Jallikattu,96,,audience,Nothing is there to say about the movie..it's just buffalo escape.. shown it like an elephant. Nowhere related to it's title.
Jallikattu,96,,audience,Lijo has packed quite a universally relevant issue regarding the very essence of being a sentient rather an savage.

When we talk about the technical side we have to appreciate the cinematographer. The BGM and post-production works were top notch. This is a must-watch if you are tired of watching cliche masala movies."
Jallikattu,96,,audience,"Although undeniably well filmed, for the most part this has all the tension of a trip to the supermarket. It's all about the last five minutes and although this does somewhat redeem the film, getting there is a slog."
Jallikattu,96,,critic,"
This is pulsating, timely moviemaking that manages to warn about human nature, greed and the dangers of an angry mob.
 "
Jallikattu,96,,critic,"
Jallikattu is a unique and operatically violent movie. What the plot lacks in narrative cohesion, it certainly makes up for in startling image and thought.
 "
Jallikattu,96,,critic,"
The film spans about a day and runs a mere 90-minutes, but in that time, it undergoes a stunning metamorphosis, from a naturalistic depiction of rural Kerala to a winking, expressionistic nightmare.

Amorphous violence explodes in a darkly unsettling tale.
 "

I was not prepared for how mesmerizing this film in terms of the cinematic delivery of such a primal story.

Politics runs like a thread through Jallikattu, but the film's intentions are never overt. Even if you watch it simply as a kinetic, exhilarating piece of cinema, it would be a memorably immersive experience.
 "
Jallikattu,96,,critic,"
Less of an 'animal attack' movie, and more of an 'animal trying to get the hell away from people for obvious reasons' movie.
 "
Jallikattu,96,,critic,"
There are visuals here that you will not be able to get out of your head. This film is only 90 minutes and you're not going to be able to look away.
 "
Jallikattu,96,,critic,"
It's a simple story drawn from life but elevated by its engaging screenplay that is raw and realistic.

If only more filmmakers could match form to politics with this degree of skill.
 "
Jallikattu,96,,critic,"
Keralan director Lijo Jose Pellissery takes to his hometown for Jalikattu, a buffalo-on-the-run bloodbath that functions as both a gentle probing of tradition and a rancorous take-down of masculinity.

Consider the idiom ""bull in a china shop"" put on notice, while ""buffalo in an Indian village"" waits, hoofs stomping, in the wings.

 "
Jallikattu,96,,critic,"
Jallikattu is alluring, unconscionable, and impossible to avert your eyes from - whether you're engaged with it or hating every second.
 "
Jallikattu,96,,critic,"
The brilliance of Jallikattu is the coexistence of its diametrically opposing natures. It has a simple story, but it's excruciatingly complex in execution. It's rural, but still crowded with people. Most of all, it's both beautiful and violent.
 "
Jallikattu,96,,critic,"
[A] sensory crescendo [that] will have you staring wide-eyed at the screen once the orgiastic rampage takes hold to burn civility to the ground-if any was even left.

Sitara: Let Girls Dream,,,critic,"
While it lacks the sheen of your average Pixar film, it has a free-flowing verve and vigor Hollywood studios could only dream of replicating. Chinoy uses gazes, glances, and mischievous glimmers to write a character piece as detailed as any feature film.
 "
Sitara: Let Girls Dream,,,critic,"
It's a bold choice to tell a child bride's painful story with animation, a method opening itself to audiences of all ages - and it's young audiences who need to see it the most.
 "
Gamak Ghar,,,critic,"
The film evokes more than it tells, and it feels like a dream in the process. It stands shoulder to shoulder with the reflective works of arthouse greats like Ozu, or perhaps Weerasethakul, though it's entirely Indian in its conception of home and family.
 "
Gamak Ghar,,,critic,"
Achal Mishra uses nostalgia in an effectively artful way in Gamak Ghar, building a densely layered and brilliantly realized portrait of cultural erosion.
 "
Gamak Ghar,,,critic,"
Traditions don't disappear overnight. They slip away slowly over decades... Few films have been able to capture this kind of ebb and flow like Achal Mishra's Gamak Ghar, a quietly beautiful drama.

Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
Eeb Allay Ooo! is the rare social satire that has the courage of its convictions. Through sweeping use of metaphor, Vats addresses themes as prickly as nationalism and religious bigotry; the plight of the marginalised, and the entitlement of the elite.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
The satire holds up beautifully as long as it explores the ridiculousness of Anjani's situation, but slips when the line between predator and prey begins to blur.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
Eeb Allay Ooo! feels as real as if it were a reality show or a documentary feature. Heartbreaking. And beautiful.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
The film lets loose its eccentricities. It begins to feel as frenzied as wildlife tearing through concrete jungles, and its gonzo energy begins to exude an uncanny sense of freedom.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
Eeb Allay Ooo! cares, lifting the migrant from the trappings of political abstractions, dignifying his fight and making him a person.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
Shardul Bhardwaj is, to put it in one word, spectacular.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
Deftly blending the frustrations and contradictions of the social, political, and economic realities of society, it paints a portrait of a nation in crisis.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
Dehumanizing power dynamics underscore Prateek Vats' enjoyable debut about a guy ill-suited to his new job as monkey chaser in Delhi.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
With its cutting satire of surviving an unjust system, this monkey business resonates far beyond Delhi.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
Vats has a background in documentary and it shows in his deep realisation of the world Anjani and his family inhabit.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
Aided by lively on-the-ground cinematography that wanders the capital with an insider's eye, this is a smart, likeable underdog comedy that should continue to engage audiences and attract further festival attention.
 "
Eeb Allay Ooo!,100,,critic,"
An original social farce where men become the monkeys.

Funny Boy,81,21,audience,"This movie is FANTASTIC! I'm so happy Ava Davurnay brought this out to the mainstream. I learned so much about Sri Lanka, and the situation there. I had no idea.  Bravo to Deepa Mehta for making an incredible film! One of her best!"
Funny Boy,81,21,audience,"Beautifully shot and poetic, Funny Boy offers a perspective on growing up ""different"" in a very conservative society, The gentle approach to what amounts to emotional repression, is cleverly magnified by the politically violent backdrop of Sinhalese versus Tamil violence in Sri Lanka."
Funny Boy,81,21,audience,"I read the prize winning  book 25 years ago, and was so thrilled to discover that they made the film.  A great story set during the Tamil struggle in Sri Lanka, which I think most people are unaware of.  Loved it !"
Funny Boy,81,21,audience,"This film is so powerful, informative, and necessary. It's amazing how it never forces the viewer to hate any particular person or group; instead, it seemed to focus on the frustration and sadness that everyone went through. This is definitely worth a watch!"
Funny Boy,81,21,audience,"Incredibly touching, occasionally funny, and colorfully crafted, Funny Boy is truly a cinematic gem for those longing for intimate, honest human stories"
Funny Boy,81,21,audience,"At it's heart, it is a beautifully simple love story, with an attention to detail that does it's story justice."
Funny Boy,81,21,audience,"I just recently saw Deepa Mehta's  latest picture Funny boy. A true and creative adaptation of Shyam Selvadurai's book. Deepa has told a story of  a time, which we all read in the news, but are forgetting the damage it did to the fabric of Sri Lankan culture. Deepa's story development  from start to the very end is deft and strong. The picture moves like a breeze covering several stories and characters. Douglas Koch's cinematography captures the joy and the pain beautifully. Howard Shore's music is sublime and truly works  for the story being told. I think the film is a triumph and a must watch for me. Deepa Mehta take a bow #tour de force"
Funny Boy,81,21,audience,"Each of the characters in the film sing of the terrible storms that are rumbling within and around them. They look close at themselves , analyze themselves and give  breath to a flood of images... raw, bloody  sumptuous and savage - at every moment bringing their destiny and morality to the surface."
Funny Boy,81,21,audience,"One of Mehta's best films. A sweeping, cinematic and empathetic film that feels particularly apt in these times. Do yourself a favour and watch."
Funny Boy,81,21,audience,"A gorgeous film that captures the emotional sensitivities and political realities of the Shyam Selvadun novel on which it is based. The lush cinematography captures the natural beauty of Sri Lanka, lingers on the steamy sensuality of two gay teenagers finding love, and documents the political turmoil that overturns the lives of Arjie and his family. A gripping story beautifully told and expertly directed. Of all Mehta's films, this one may be her best."
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
The timing of the release of Funny Boy couldn't be better than at this particular moment. If people are able to overlook some of the issues... Funny Boy is still worth seeing for its various messages of understanding.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
Paradoxically, the film is most engaging when it's a relatively laid-back love story. But it also richly conveys the swift demolition of one's ability to feel safe at home.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
The romance between the teens is tender...and the larger drama of violence provides a valuable backdrop for examining prejudice. This is a beautifully filmed and acted story about the turmoil of sexual, ethnic, religious and class difference.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
While the story soft-pedals the brutal violence between the Tamil and Sinhalese people, the story of a privileged Tamil teen (Brandon Ingram) finding inner peace amid a world of conflict remains touching, tender and memorable.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
...a respectable effort with plenty to say about the patriarchy, gender roles, young love and, for good measure, political drama.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
Despite its occasional failings, Funny Boy proves to be a moving retrospective on violence - both the explosive and bloody kind, as well as the intimate, emotional, and quieter violence of family - and the zest for life it so often threatens.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
The film satisfies itself with contrasts that reek of manipulative melodrama.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
This is a beautiful exploration of how a plurality of opinions can both coexist and make a society stronger, while bigotry and fear weaken everybody they touch.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
It's an effective mix of familiar coming-out personal drama and external political issues.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
It's a strange case of a film that is doing all it can to minimise its cultural specificity to tell a ""universal"" coming of age story, generalising the historical context to such an extent that the story fails to have any impact.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
Queer coming-of-age story has violence and racism.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
Not the most original story or original treatment of love-in-a-time-of-war as a theme. But ""Funny Boy"" is valuable in letting us see this world and this history through different eyes.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
Funny Boy may just become the sleeper hit of 2021.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
Deepa Mehta's touch for this material is exactly right and the blueprint of the novel is closely followed.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
""Funny Boy"" is a luminous coming-of-age tale seen through the eyes of a relatable yet entirely unique experience.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
Worst of all, it soft-sells the horror of ethnic cleansing, with a climactic neighbourhood massacre reduced to a few broken windows and some offensive chanting.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
""Funny Boy"" makes the history accessible and relevant in our own incredibly polarized times.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
Like Arjie, the film has infectious joie de vivre. Let it wash over you.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
Funny Boy falters when trying to link together the personal and political, making for a well-intentioned film that never delivers much depth.
 "
Funny Boy,81,21,critic,"
""Funny Boy"" ambitiously braids internal and external conflict, familial and national strife, to engrossing if somewhat heavily condensed effect.

His House,100,75,audience,"Your ghosts follow you. They live with you. They never leave.  

Ok. This was actually pretty good, and scary, and exciting. This is how you reinvent the haunted house genre. It goes way beyond jump scares. It relies on grief, trauma, and letting go of the past. It does get scary and it has very creepy imagery that will stay with you after the credits roll, and even if it feels kind of slow at some point, in the end, it all adds to the story."
His House,100,75,audience,"His House is the story of South Sudanese refuges trying to adjust to living in England in government housing with the creatures that live there and their own traumatic memories.  Strong performances and general creepiness work well.  It is great to see something ""new"" in the horror world.  I wish a little more info was provided on the ""big bad"" as culturally most viewers wont have a lot of perspectives on it which makes it tricky to judge the final act.  This film will likely work even for those who don't like most horror movies."
His House,100,75,audience,"This movie is confusing, not scary, and just bad. The demon scene at the end made no sense."
His House,100,75,audience,"I didn't find it as scary or well done as many others did, but it's a good ride with limited horror."
His House,100,75,audience,"It is a slow-burning movie, so one has to be patient to watch it, it is not a template based horror movie. In fact, it is more of a psychological thriller than horror. It explores human nature to a depth, using the life of refugees as the background."
His House,100,75,audience,"This movie would've done extremely well during the movie theater era... Thankfully Netflix audience is big so more people have access to the well crafted and absolutely beautifully shot movie. It was short, but built tension really well. The script and the cinematography gave life to the outstanding acting performances and the great directed. I loved it no cap."
His House,100,75,audience,Remi Weekes' debut feature utilizes an original subject matter for the genre with genuine scares and emotional resonance.
His House,100,75,audience,Kind of put it on in the background. Got totally sucked in. Really well formulated. Definitely more than a ‘haunted house” story. Recommended.
His House,100,75,audience,His house mezcla el drama que viven los refugiados junto al género de terror de manera satisfactoria.
His House,100,75,audience,Creepy and scary. Not your usual look at the refugee experience.
His House,100,75,critic,"
His House is an extraordinary haunted-house film, and also an excellent horror film in the genre, ""Is she crazy?""
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
His House uses the supernatural to examine guilt, trauma, masculinity, and how outsiders assimilate into new cultures.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
While a little too on the nose with its metaphors along with a dreadful procurement that would have used a little more scope, the film serves as a strangely accurate portrayal of going through the refugee experience.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
Despite its failings, the film is worth watching for the good work from its two leads, and because there are some sorts of horror that don't get talked about nearly as much as they should.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
There's an artistic touch to His House that should not go without mention.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
The film is a superb horror that reflects on the psychological scar a war perpetuates on its victims and those impossible choices that they are forced to make.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
It's a strong debut by Weekes and nails the essential part of a horror movie: the horror.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
The film has much to say about grief, guilt, assimilation and the on-going refugee crisis. And on top of all that, it's also a nifty nerve-jangler.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
His House is a terrifying debut that breathes a fresh voice into the haunted-house subgenre.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
Moves the tired, old haunted house horror story to new, deeply felt places. It may drag in spots, but His House is a thrilling rethink of what the genre can be.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
The movie's acting is effective, but the story's real impact comes from the lingering feeling that people can move to different places, but they can't really escape from emotional baggage ... [The movie is] also a blistering meditation on trauma.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
The twist, when it comes, feels simultaneously inevitable and devastating, while the coda accesses a hard-earned ambivalence about what it means to make a house a home...
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"
His House is a breath of fresh air and exemplifies the diversity of stories that are still waiting to be told.
 "
His House,100,75,critic,"

""Your life is not yours. You stole it,"" whispers one of the figures tormenting the pair, and that self-doubt is perhaps the most unsettling aspect of all. His House is top-tier horror.

Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,,95,audience,It is good movie. The story is simple but direction is awesome.
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,,95,audience,Winning chemistry and amazing locales overcomes spectacular nonsensical occurrences and a fight scene at the end that nearly derails all the goodwill
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,,95,audience,"Finally watched DDLJ.
When we review cinema then we look for things like techniques, story telling, cinematography, portrayals etc. etc.
But this is not movie-making, it is something beyond this.
IT IS SIMPLY MAGIC!! 
Something only possible in Indian CInema. People might disagree but they should be the one who want to tell the world how intellectual they are."

Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,,95,audience,"Even though ""DDLJ"" is so cheesy at times that it made my eyes roll, I still couldn't resist the movie's sweet and simple story and charisma. This is one of the most iconic films Bollywood has ever seen and it will likely stay that way for a long time to come. It's easy to see why so many people re-watch this movie. It has a simple story with two leads that have outstanding chemistry. The movie also boasts an impressive soundtrack with songs that I am sure have been stuck in my head long before I decided to watch this movie start to finish, as I've heard them for years. This movie is entertaining and brings nothing but smiles. There's a beauty in the film's simplicity that few others in Bollywood possess."
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,,95,audience,Best bollywood movie ever.
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,,95,audience,i want to see that movie
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,,95,critic,"
Today, DDLJ is at once both intimately familiar and unmistakably of its era, a response to the influx of western culture into India in the 1990s and an attempt to center both progress and tradition in the very same breath.

Spring Blossom,95,,critic,"
Writer-director Suzanne Lindon's ... dazzling directorial debut once again proves that there's nothing more romantic than Parisian cafés and sun-bleached boulevards.
 "
Spring Blossom,95,,critic,"
Undoubtedly smart and socially conscious, and effective at pulling you into Suzanne's smitten feelings, Spring Blossom is a good start for the young artist, but lacks thematic depth and bite.

A slide of sensations with more promise than maturity. A tribute to the classic French cinema that has beauty, but not high flight. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Spring Blossom,95,,critic,"
The most striking thing about Spring Blossom, in which a 16-year-old girl falls in love with a man in his mid-thirties, is that it stars 20-year-old director Suzanne Lindon in the leading role.
 "

Those are smart creative choices. While ""Spring Blossom"" may demand judicious pruning, it hints at bigger things yet to bloom for Lindon.

Dunkirk,92,81,audience,"Very intense acting, captivating score, a bit loud and difficult to understand but I appreciated that it didn't feel too long."
Dunkirk,92,81,audience,brilliant movie. a must watched
Dunkirk,92,81,audience,"Dunkirk has some of the best visuals I have ever seen. Incredible camera work.

I loved the time jumps between the different stories.

Overall, a satisfying war film telling a true heroic story."
Dunkirk,92,81,audience,fabulous. effects were surreal
Dunkirk,92,81,audience,The best cinema experiences of my life. We were on the edge of our seats. The score by Hanz Zimmer was brilliant.
Dunkirk,92,81,audience,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE WHICH I EVER SEE IN MY LIFE
Dunkirk,92,81,audience,"Missed the opportunity to watch this in 35mm in theaters, but boy am I glad to watch it with a good surround system. The music, the visuals, the story capturing capabilities are beautiful. The ending feels a bit rushed but it covers exactly what was needed to portray the evacuation of Dunkirk!"
Dunkirk,92,81,audience,"I'd almost given up on Christopher Nolan after his previous film, Interstellar, turned out to be a bloated, pretentious, boring mess. Luckily I didn't, as Dunkirk is everything that film wasn't - it's lean, mean and tense. Not perfect (Nolan needs to stop writing his own scripts), but a massive improvement and one of his best films."
Dunkirk,92,81,audience,"Feels like both a summation and refinement of Nolan's structural, visual and sonic sensibilities. It doesn't add up to much, but it's something to see. The aerial scenes really put you there."
Dunkirk,92,81,audience,"A beautiful piece of cinematography, but the editing can be a little odd if you're not paying attention. However, overall this is an amazing film, I think Nolan did an excellent job with this film. For a historical film, I think the film team did an amazing job putting together beautiful practical effects, to make the evacuation look so realistic and believable. From the dog fights to the flaming sea, this film is amazing and would recommend it 10/10 for movie night!"
Dunkirk,92,81,critic,"
I stand by my assertion that Dunkirk is Nolan's masterpiece.
 "
Dunkirk,92,81,critic,"
Unseriousness about history combines with lack of knowledge, all of it justified on the grounds that only individual, subjective perceptions of reality are possible.
 "
Dunkirk,92,81,critic,"
It's true that it's themes are a little on the nose - the film's tagline is ""Hope is a weapon. Survival is victory"" - but Christopher Nolan makes it work with a sense of immediacy not often found in movies.
 "
Dunkirk,92,81,critic,"
If one can ignore the infuriating narrative structuring, there are plenty of technical achievements worth seeing.

Its structural experimentation makes it one of Nolan's most intense, incisive and emotionally engaging works.
 "
Dunkirk,92,81,critic,"
Christopher Nolan recreates the World War II evacuation of Dunkirk by fracturing the narrative across three overlapping timelines: an hour in the air with Tom Hardy, a day at sea with Mark Rylance, and a week on shore with Kenneth Branagh.

Dunkirk,92,81,critic,"
Dunkirk is more than just a war film. You're watching a survival horror film, a psychologically, relentless suspense trip that Hitchcock would be proud of. It results in a film that leaves you breathless.

As a technical achievement, I'd certainly give the framework high praise, but as an instrument in delivering high drama, I'm less than convinced. This is still very much a recommendation.
 "
Dunkirk,92,81,critic,"
The marriage of performance, sound, structure, and downright astonishing visuals makes Dunkirk the ultimate moviegoing experience.
 "
Dunkirk,92,81,critic,"
There is nothing clinical about it, just good old-fashioned elbow grease filmmaking. Sometimes, it's all it takes.
 "
Dunkirk,92,81,critic,"
By bringing Dunkirk in at a brisk (for him) 106 minutes, Nolan rediscovers his gift for concision that made his early gems like Memento so pleasing.

[O]ne of the most captivating and compelling films of the year so far.
 "

The Dark Knight Rises,87,90,audience,The perfect ending of a perfect trilogy.
The Dark Knight Rises,87,90,audience,"There are not enough words to describe the magnitude of this film, let alone space to even attempt it. So I'll do my best with what I have.

This film is perfect in every way. The synergy of elements, both technical, dramatic, and those supplied by the audience (such as emotional investment in the series, etc.) make it perfect. Writer/Director Chris Nolan understood how invested the audiences were in this series and he hit every single note perfectly.

The picture unfolds like a beautiful nightmare. We ease back into the world of Gotham well enough that we recognize the world we left briefly from the Dark Knight. Instantly we feel that the stakes are higher, and as the film goes on, the stakes are raised even further, seemingly impossibly so. Then, finally, as the picture hits its stride, we find ourselves engrossed in a spectacle the likes of which have not been approached since Lord of the Rings.

The depth of story and character, like so many of Nolan's films, are what bring all the elements to a head. Bane is maniacle, calculating, determined, and above all, undeniably and irrevocably brutally violent. This violence takes all forms, and manifests itself into some of the most brilliantly awe-inspiring action sequences you will EVER see.

Dark Knight Rises gets better with every passing second, between the action, the intrigue, the drama, and the mystery, the final result is nothing short of stunning. And while this may be an opinionated review, I beg every person alive to experience what this film has to offer.

I swear on my life this movie is pure perfection"
The Dark Knight Rises,87,90,audience,"All i can say is, I had high expectations coming into this movie. VERY high. And this movie completely exceeded them. It was beyond perfect, perfectly sequenced, a complex but amazing storyline which creates for a magnificent finish, with some twists and turns. This movie is filled with brilliant scenes, which are absolutely epic. I really felt part of this, I had actually felt like Gotham was going to be destroyed by the strategist, and muscle-head Bane, who was the perfect villain. It was a thrilling experience, a ride the whole way through. It was psychological, physical and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way true. It's going to be tough getting over this film, and the fact that the batman series has come to a conclusion. Nolan has created a masterpiece, phenomenal"
The Dark Knight Rises,87,90,audience,"The Dark Knight Rises is an ambitious, thoughtful and brutal climax to Christopher Nolan's story of Bruce Wayne.

Bane is a great villain, what a menacing voice.

I loved the ending and always wished Nolan did a Robin movie with Joseph Gordon-Levitt."
The Dark Knight Rises,87,90,audience,"I can't express in words of how amazing this movie is. All I have to say is go watch it for yourself.the is really the best,don't get me wrong i enjoyed the others but this one truly takes the cake!I said before batman begins is the best film i had ever seen without any exception. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.a big kiss for Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway i really love them.if i visit USA this will be for visit Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway. thanks for all"
The Dark Knight Rises,87,90,audience,"The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 epic superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story, with David S. Goyer. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy, and the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008). Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, with a returning cast of allies: Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. The film introduces Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a sly, morally ambiguous cat burglar, and Bane (Tom Hardy), a mercenary bent on destroying Gotham City who forces an older Bruce Wayne to come out of retirement and become Batman again.

Christopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a second time, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 ""Knightfall"" storyline, the 1986 series The Dark Knight Returns, and the 1999 storyline ""No Man's Land"". Filming took place in locations including Jodhpur,[5] London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, and Pittsburgh. Nolan used IMAX cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A variation of the Batplane termed the ""Bat"", an underground prison set, and a new Batcave set were created specifically for the film. As with The Dark Knight, viral marketing campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.

The Dark Knight Rises premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012. The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, 2012, and in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. Upon release it received critical acclaim and is widely considered by publications to be one of the best films of 2012.[6][7][8][9] Like its predecessor, the film grossed over $1 billion worldwide at the box office, making it the second film in the Batman film series, and by extension the second film based on a DC Comics character, to earn $1 billion. It is currently the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time, the third-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the third-highest-grossing superhero film of all time"
The Dark Knight Rises,87,90,audience,"The Dark Knight Rises is an incredible conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy that's emotionally satisfying, thrilling and epic. Christian Bale is a reliably incredible Batman/ Bruce Wayne, Anne Hathaway is an incredible Catwoman and Tom Hardy is also incredible as Bane. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are perfect once again. Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon Levitt are both great. Christopher Nolan's direction is incredible and it's extremely well filmed with the best fight scenes of the trilogy. The pacing is great and the music by Hans Zimmer is perfect"
The Dark Knight Rises,87,90,audience,"This film is absolutely fantastic, and a great ending to one of the best trilogies that Hollywood has ever produced. Anne Hathaway gives a stunning performance as Catwoman, and Tom Hardy is truly menacing as the films villain, Bane. As ever, Michael Caine gives another classic performance, perfectly portraying Alfred Pennyworth. The plot is great, with twists and turns, and a very unexpected ending. The script writing is excellent, and Banes voice belies his true nature. Overall, this easily one of the best films ever made, and I recommend it to everyone and anyone"
The Dark Knight Rises,87,90,audience,"A 2 hour and 45 minute movie that will span greatness to the world. The Dark Knight Rises is not only one of the BEST films I have ever seen, it is the BEST superhero film ever made. I have never shivered because of a villain in any movie. Bane made me shiver. Tom Hardy did an excellent job playing such an evil part. The twists were just as great. By far though, the star of the movie was Anne Hathaway for her stunning performance as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. She played the role like she has been that person her whole life. Absolutely stunning. My only complaint was that they didn't include Bane's backstory, but other than that, this film was a site to behold. Christian Bale did his finest work as the playboy billionaire turned hero Bruce Wayne/Batman. David S. Goyer wrote a fantastic story as well. The end of the movie was a total cliffhanger also. Everybody in the theater thought this may actually be the end, but turns out, it may not be the end. Here comes sequels... Christopher Nolan, you have done it again"
The Dark Knight Rises,87,90,audience,"t concludes this trilogy in such a great way that makes the three movies function as one piece of storytelling. Most importantly, it's an amazingly written and acted story that lives up to the hype generated by the previous ones and faithful and honest towards the comics that originally brought The Dark Knight to a legend status"

Inception,87,91,audience,Immensely influential and a true captivator of imagination. One of the greatest film scores around by Zimmer. Impeccably casted and extremely imaginative. Probably Nolan's magnum opus.
Inception,87,91,audience,"I dreamed that I watched this movie, or maybe I didn't. At any rate, I thought the whole thing was dumb."
Inception,87,91,audience,"With its exceptional writing, direction, and acting, Christopher Nolan's Inception is a must-see."
Inception,87,91,audience,"An all-star cast, legendary director, and original screenplay. Inception was one of the first movies that made an impression on me and inspired me to be in the film industry."
Inception,87,91,audience,"Inception is really well done, and they merged a lot of weird material into a single, somewhat cohesive film.  Strong on visuals and weirdness.  I admit, it made more sense watching it the second time.  I have some minor issues with the film - why do we dream in fractals?  Why are the dreams always synced?  Why do we dream 'faster'? etc.. but those things are kind of marginal to the plot as it rips along.  If I had a major quibble, I guess I am not really sure who the 'good guys' are here, and Leonardo, while a competent actor, is not likeable.  But then, maybe that is what they were going for here."
Inception,87,91,audience,"Rewatch this adventure from my favorite director Nolan. The first time that I watched it, which was long ago, I remembered not getting the full story, so I didn't think it was a masterpiece, although I did like it. However, this time was quite different. 

I was hooked right away within the opening scene, which showed the dream within a dream sequence that introduced the premise very well. Then, as the characters showed more about the movie's universe, I was so amazed with the cinematography, like the scene where the dream world was flip into half up and down. 

The story itself was complicated and required me to stay focused. Since I got some memories of when I first watched the movie, I did not struggle too much to fully grasp what was going on. This was for sure not as complicated as Tenet. 

With the story, Nolan dived into the human subconscious and applied the Freudian psychology. 

Overall, a total blast for the whole 2.5 hours. This is definitely one of Nolan's best masterpieces. 9.5/10"
Inception,87,91,audience,"Wonderful, it kept me thrilled until the end.  I cannot even convey the amount of time that I spent speculating about the ending.  Absolute MUST SEE."
Inception,87,91,audience,"This is one of the best cinematic viewing experiences that has ever been made and will likely remain so for the rest of human history. The level of complexity in the plot, the attention to detail, the clear and wise cinematography choices with differing color palettes and excellent camera angles, and the sheer ambition to pull off a film of this magnitude are all breathtaking and leave me with a sense of reverence for Nolan. The issue I had was that he went out of his way to introduce elements to make the team's path to success more difficult but did so in an unfortunate way, having his main character thoughtlessly insist on imperiling the mission when plenty of alternatives existed for relaying to Eames the shortcut and explaining away the added danger of sedation by basically making it a magical sedative that only leaves you in mortal danger within the dream but will still let you wake up if kicked. Surely with some proofreading or outside notes these could've been handled more carefully and we would've been left with an absolute timeless masterpiece. Alas, we are left with only a fantastically good movie instead."
Inception,87,91,audience,"If you're looking for a satisfying action thriller, this is definitely for you. It can be a little difficult to understand on the first viewing, but believe me, it's very much worth the little extra brainpower spent looking at it."
Inception,87,91,audience,"In a world where anything is possible nothing is surprising. Thus this movie is a compete bore. 
One ad hoc twist after another explained away by the fact that people can, not only enter each others dreams, but can add to the dream's content as well. 
Then, of course, someone in a dream can go to sleep and create another dream level. 
When someone gets killed in a dream they wake up into the next higher level. But for some reason another twist is added whereby the dreamer sometimes does not wake up but ends up trapped in a place called ‘limbo'. Don't ask me why. 
Of course, after a while you lose track of the dreams and their levels. 
If you can stand all this then go ahead and see    the movie. I myself did not find one minute interesting."

The Prestige,76,92,audience,"The Prestige is a twisting, turning, thriller about obsession, loss, and revenge. The whole film itself is like a big magic trick, watching for the first time you'll be blown away by the twists that were hidden in plain view. Rewatching is fun to see the hints that may have flown right by on your first watch. Jackman and Bale give fantastic performances"
The Prestige,76,92,audience,"this is one of my top 5 Nolan films. the cast is incredible, the storytelling is well utilised and it contains one of the best plot twists in cinematic history."
The Prestige,76,92,audience,A movie who's foreshadowing exponentially grows to leave you with a dropped jaw at the ending scene. Fantastic film that I feel the need to watch several more times.
The Prestige,76,92,audience,Chris Nolan is the GOAT!!!
The Prestige,76,92,audience,This was the best movie from Christopher Nolan so far. And I've seen a lot. The last half hour is so unexpected.
The Prestige,76,92,audience,"Great film that can be quite mystifying to the audience. I was able to predict the twists and turns, but then again, this was the second to last of Nolan's movies that I have watched. His work is great in the way he tries to bend the minds of the audience, with plenty of twists and turns along the way. Christian Bale's performance was a standout, as he was charming with his wit and the way he was a character who could be despised and loved at the same time. Definitely watch this movie, especially if you're a fan of Christopher Nolan."
The Prestige,76,92,audience,"'The Prestige' is able to indulge you within the magician world filled with tricks up its sleeve, and it serves the trick of wanting to witness the magic unfold over and over again."
The Prestige,76,92,audience,"A hauntingly good film which will stay with you for a long time. Christopher Nolan is a master of combining deeply felt character drama into heady high-concept sci-fi, all while somehow staying firmly grounded. Of course it's possible to set expectations by over hyping a movie, let's just settle on hyping it enough so that you definitely watch it - however much hype that may be, I'm fairly certain it's justified."
The Prestige,76,92,audience,Have on DVD!!!!!!!!!!
The Prestige,76,92,audience,Worth the watch for sure. Fun to figure out. Fun to watch Bale and Jackman. I loved it. Really well done. Impressive
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
Just when viewers think they've figured things out, that's when the exquisite diversionary tactics really kick in.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
A leap back to his stellar Memento form, Christopher Nolan's fifth feature is an incisive work about the nature of creative obsession. The film bursts forth fully formed, richly detailed, and with a keen eye toward Nolan's usual brushstrokes
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
The Prestige's magic is real. You just have to be looking for it.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
The Prestige does not impress as a magic act. It is an elaborate contraption that leaves the viewer confounded and confused, but never feeling particularly entertained or delighted by the performance.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
The Prestige does require a slight leap of faith, but the journey is so entertaining, it is a leap well worth taking.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
When you discover the secret to a magic trick, all you want is to re-watch it and see if you can spot the illusion, so too does The Prestige demand repeat viewings.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
Nolan's most perfect commentary on his favourite auteur theme of mise en abyme, as both magicians in their own ways make near Faustian pacts for their climactic 'prestige'.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
Although the film's stunning reveals make the audience realise it has been duped... there is a protagonist to empathise with each time.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
While you're looking here, it's executing a trick there, and the film is, in fact, structured like a magic act with three parts called the Pledge, the Turn and the Prestige.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
Yes, the film is built on deceptions, and yes, it features a series of interconnected twists, but like all good movies and magic tricks, it doesn't lose any glory in a repeated performance or viewing, only gains it.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
Nolan has conjured a bold mix of thriller and period piece, with even a precocious dab of science fiction.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
Until an inexplicably awful revelation at the end, The Prestige is a taut, exciting portrait of obsession and the dark competitive spirit of professional magicians.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
Risible inanity
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
Although the slowish pacing early on over-indicates how both magicians' marquee misdirection (a disappearing act) will be achieved, The Prestige still manages a neat trick of its own.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
Show me a director better suited for a movie about magic than Christopher Nolan and I'll show you... a magician?
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
The film is never less than engaging, though considering that the title The Prestige refers to the moment in a magic act that gives it its ""wow"" factor, it's kind of a shame that the ultimate ""reveal"" in the movie is a little too tricky for its own good.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
""The Prestige"" is a cinematic trick, nothing more, and the deadpan seriousness is part of the effect, and not an end in itself.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
In a movie about people who make their livings on misdirection, The Prestige utterly forgets to employ its own.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
It's quite a movie -- atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic.
 "
The Prestige,76,92,critic,"
Nolan balances Hollywood and indie sensibilities pulling off a film that is smart, complicated and carries a big look.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,audience,"The first movie in the Dark Knight trilogy and my least favourite.

Batman Begins was a huge improvement over the awful Batman films from the mid 90s. Christopher Nolan brought a more realistic and dark Bruce Wayne to our screens.

A solid start to the trilogy."
Batman Begins,84,94,audience,"I always thought the Dark Knight was the greatest of the Christopher Nolan Batmen, but I am now having second thoughts after revisiting Batman Begins this past weekend. The difference I now draw between the two are their subtleties. The Dark Knight has the most iconic villains of all time in Heath Ledger's Joker, who is memorable precisely because of his flamboyance and theatrics. But the villain in Batman Begins is as illusory as the shadow ninjas it is composed of, and the villain of Batman Begins blends in with its surroundings of modern society. Much like Thanos from the MCU, the villains make some compelling arguments about good and evil - and their primary goals are to rid the world of evil. But it requires strength of character to resist evil means to achieve a ""good"" end. 

Batman Begins requires multiple rewatches - I caught more information during this round than I had ever remembered before. You need to pay more attention during this movie than the Dark Knight, but you will be rewarded for the effort."
Batman Begins,84,94,audience,"Such a clean, intense, and complex film. It takes itself very seriously, but doesn't go overboard. Christopher Nolan was the perfect choice for this trilogy."
Batman Begins,84,94,audience,"A very good movie, an excellent start to a great franchise. (4.5) Stars"
Batman Begins,84,94,audience,Awesome Batman movie.
Batman Begins,84,94,audience,Testing TEsting testing
Batman Begins,84,94,audience,"Es mi favorita de la trilogía, me la he visto un montón de veces."
Batman Begins,84,94,audience,"I had not seen this movie in 10 years, because I remembered not really liking it the first time, but man did I enjoy watching it just now in 2021.  I wouldn't say that it has good dialog, but it does have a lot of great lines.  The practical effects have aged incredibly well, too.  It just does such an amazing job of establishing a comic book world that isn't so much realistic as it is believable, which is something the Marvel movies never achieved for me.  I give it an A - Make a point to go see this movie"
Batman Begins,84,94,audience,"Something worse than Katie holmes-Katie holmes, in a batman movie- or any superhero movie for that-with all her superhero counterparts equally sucking, of her time- Margot Robbie, Scarlett and Amy Adams-the worst-and every boring male, to fill their overgrown, balloon 🎈 inflated suits-ben, George and the newest and greatest-Robert pattinson -snoozing even the coolest book 📚- comic book heros-brining English to the outside and not in -""I can stand that cover but there's too much colour -it's making my eyes hurt, seizure?""

Batman Begins,84,94,audience,This is a great film it teaches to win from fear great story and action. Superb film you will love to watch
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Admirable in its emphasis on character over gadgetry, and is ambitious for a summer blockbuster, but for me, unfortunately it never quite takes flight.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
All in all, it definitely changes the course - for the better - of this formerly failing franchise.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Batman is shackled by one of the most potent recurring themes in Nolan's work: a fear of the past, in all its pain, guilt and trauma - a fear that the forward march of time may not be enough to heal.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Batman Begins is an utterly conventional, conformist work, respectful of order and wealth, unable or unwilling to challenge any of contemporary society's taboos. Worse than that, its grim pomposity and self-seriousness invite only laughter.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Batman Begins is certainly a worthy staging post in the inescapably compelling career of Christopher Nolan, and stands the test of time some 15 years after its release.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Batman Begins is easily one of the best films featuring the iconic DC Comics superhero, but far from perfect, despite telling what may just end up being the definitive big screen origin story for the Dark Knight.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Bale provides the series with the best Batman thus far, with a dark and conflicted performance that easily matches Nolan's tone.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
With a phenomenal cast, technical work that is beyond reproach and attention to detail that is generally only seen in works by Spielberg or Lucas, Batman Begins is a perfect way to begin the summer movie season.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
The Batman origin story that we've been waiting for!
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
The film looks great and there some striking set-pieces, but in spite of a series of comic quips -- the new film lacks a sense of adventure and fun. Nevertheless, Nolan, Goyer and Bale have still managed to revitalize the ailing franchise.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
I like that it embraces comic book sensibilities a little bit more than other Nolan films. Definitely a bit too long but a good origin story
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Batman has been all about darkness, Nolan just makes it a shade darker. Go see it.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
That the movie ends up thematising the murk of our modern world, if not exactly piecing it together into a comprehensible whole, is perhaps as much as we can expect.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Nolan has created a Batman epic that races so far ahead of its predecessors that they simply cease to exist.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Batman Begins isn't a terrible film, it simply isn't that good. Overly long, vaguely goofy in places, and straining for gravity and dignity, it's the dignity part that is hard.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
... Nolan gets the character right: Bruce Wayne is the secret identity and Batman is the real persona.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
It's a refreshing approach to the genre, even when revisiting years later, in an era inundated with superhero movies where each tries to better the last's visual effects budget.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Nolan takes an admirable stab at developing a character-driven drama, only to give in to generic action-movie conventions with a blinding, deafening, explosion-laden finale that could have capped off any number of interchangeable Jerry Bruckheimer flicks.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Batman Begins summons up moments of great eloquence and power. If only its cast of characters was as fully inhabited as its turbulent city.
 "
Batman Begins,84,94,critic,"
Christopher Nolan made something special with his Batman films and it feels like Batman Begins is often overlooked due to the reputation of The Dark Knight. Fans should at least appreciate Batman Begins in a similar light if not a slightly brighter one.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,audience,"Interesting take on the genre of the who killed who genre, was enjoyable, the performances of the cast was great and what kept me watching. Good movie overall"
Insomnia,92,77,audience,this is a film you really only need to see once or twice. after that it gets slightly boring because you know what happens.
Insomnia,92,77,audience,This is exactly what I wanted Heat to be.
Insomnia,92,77,audience,"Such a fine cast, and somehow shows what it is like to have insomnia. Very interesting movie."
Insomnia,92,77,audience,"This isn't Christopher Nolan in full form, but he has high standards. The cinematography are great in the movie. The light penetrating through the curtains into Pacino's eyes is brilliant. The light feels bothersome even for the viewer, which is exactly the effect they needed. Hillary Swank is amazing in the movie, as she goes from side character to possibly main character. Very fun movie if you're into a little thrill. It's not too graphic either so I would say anybody with any sort of maturity can watch it. Pass the time by and watch this great movie in Nolan's catalog."
Insomnia,92,77,audience,"Probably Christopher Nolan's only un-Christopher Nolan film, but I think it could be his best and definitely the most underrated. This doesn't have the usual over complicated Nolan storytelling, but it does have three fantastic performances from Pacino, Williams and Swank. Found it to be engaging and clever, whilst the Alaskan setting is simply beautiful."
Insomnia,92,77,audience,Dang they don't make movies like this these days.
Insomnia,92,77,audience,Very good movie so exciting
Insomnia,92,77,audience,"This movie is alright. Its a decent film in general but when you put into play that its a Chris Nolan film, it was a bit disappointing. He's a genius and a god but this movie was just average. The movie is really carried by Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Their performances are great. Other than that, the film was a bit slow, it wasn't too twisty as other Chris Nolan works, and could be a bit boring at times."
Insomnia,92,77,audience,It was very boring with a great cast.
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Watching Nolan's final pre-Batman outing reveals a subtle finessing of his M.O. - not just thematically, but visually.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Dormer has a weariness that Pacino wears perfectly, always finding some new depth to his exhaustion and despair without ever being a sleepy presence on screen.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
A deceptively run-of-the-mill cop thriller based round an ingenious psychological theme.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
...evocative imagery, a compelling story, and one of Pacino's best performances of the 21st century.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Insomnia is not so much about the murder mystery as it is about Will's internal struggle with what's right and what's possibly okay.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Who allowed these performances, or maybe even encouraged them? Christopher Nolan, that's who. He was so intent on dolloping pizazz onto this story that he didn't notice the visual syrup was drowning a six-inch stack of toaster waffles.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
In the world of Christopher Nolan, memory is still as treacherous as nitroglycerin.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Insomnia proves that Memento wasn't a fluke: Nolan is a major talent with many more good films ahead of him.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Nolan uses Pacino the icon as much as Pacino the actor, and the latter turns in one of his best performances, almost vanity free.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
The film represents a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery. Which is to say that Nolan makes you feel the end-of-the-earth bleakness of his setting, makes you feel the way it can discombobulate people once they internalize it.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
With a run-of-the-mill bad-guy actor playing chief suspect Walter Finch, the movie might have tipped too far Pacino's way. But Robin Williams is a shockingly effective counterweight.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Christopher Nolan's Insomnia adds 11 minutes to the Norwegian movie of the same name and manages to make everything that was fleeting and tantalizing in the original weighty, literal and dull.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Scene by scene, screenwriter Hillary Seitz follows director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's original closely, but this remake deepens and improves upon the Norwegian film by giving Dormer a more complex relationship with Eckhart.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
A smart, intricately constructed thriller, the film has far more on its mind than just who done it.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Not as audacious as Memento, Christopher Nolan's first studio feature is nevertheless a confident and intelligent thriller that demonstrates a canny ability to fuse his own concerns with guilt, subjective experience and narrative to a mainstream package.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Christopher Nolan's follow-up to Memento is just as taut and ambiguous as its predecessor and -- arguably -- features better performances from its leading me
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
This skilfully directed psychodrama from Christopher Nolan proves that hit European movies can be remade successfully.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Christopher Nolan, the promising writer-director behind Following and Memento, makes an elegant and assured transfer to big-budget, star-driven film-making with Insomnia.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Part mystery, part moral dilemma, but all seductively intriguing.
 "
Insomnia,92,77,critic,"
Nolan uses visual pyrotechnics to pump up the tension and add to Pacino's sense of disorientation, but the feeling he evokes isn't as forlorn, creepy, or ambiguous as in the original (though the mountain wilderness is just as forbidding).
 "
Memento,93,94,audience,"How much can we remember and forget at the same time? 
I remember watching this in film studies class in high school. 
Christopher Nolan's directorial debut 
Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano 
Leonard Shelby lost his wife after she was killed and raped in their home. He's been trying to track down the culprit. The biggest obstacle is however he suffers from short term memory loss. It only lasts for 15 min at a time so he's made a living by tattooing his entire body in important notes to stay on track. He's also got polaroids with clues to assist him. The two biggest people in his life is a woman named Natalie and his supposed partner, Teddy. 
It's very interesting to see the narrative told out of order and dissecting it's connective tissue 
Truly feels like putting the pieces of a puzzle together 
Memories are interpretations not records, different ones can change a room or a feeling and can be distorted, if you already have the facts they're irrelevant, taking away someone's memories is like taking away their life of meaning, do we rely more on remembering or on instinct?, certainties are the types of memories you take for granted, we all lie to be happy but is there something wrong about that? 
Every time it feels like Leonard is getting closer it's almost as if he's losing more and more every day. Is he on point or just assuming too much? How is he supposed to heal if he can't feel time going forward or backwards?Maybe he's losing all sense of purpose and the constant reminders are maybe his only link. 
Nolan makes his first feature mind-boggling but also intelligently challenging for the viewer. One of his best efforts truly."
Memento,93,94,audience,A masterpiece and a must-watch for any true cinephile
Memento,93,94,audience,"Before Christopher Nolan began working with big budgets and the associated special effects and bells and whistles, he introduced Memento to the world, a film that focused on character development and plot instead of the mind-numbing noise and ridiculous complexity of some of his later works.  Famous for the scenes being presented in reverse chronological order, Memento is a compelling and cleverly constructed film noir.  Instead of following a chain of events and wondering what the outcome will be, Nolan presents the outcome and forces the viewer to piece together clues regarding the actual chain of events.  Pay attention, though…anyone who watches this and loses focus will lose the thread of the story."
Memento,93,94,audience,Interesting demo of a technique which accomplishes  its purpose. But I did not enjoy the experience.
Memento,93,94,audience,"Great, puzzling story with another well-thought out ending that makes rewatches worth your time."
Memento,93,94,audience,Christopher Nolan likes making confusing films but this one is not too confusing and contains an excellent performance from Pierce.
Memento,93,94,audience,Christopher Nolan is always playing with time but this is one the best moments of it.
Memento,93,94,audience,"Pretty good. While the films first thirty minutes are pretty confusing and dont seem to make sense, all of the sudden the story starts to make sense and the pieces start to come together to create an interesting mystery thriller with emotional depth and plot twists galore. If you can get through the first 30 mins without loosing interest, you are in for a wild ride!"
Memento,93,94,audience,"Esse é um dos filmes impossíveis de esquecer de ter assistido.
Um dos favoritos.
Filmão da porra."
Memento,93,94,audience,What did I just watch? So overhyped!
Memento,93,94,critic,"
A nifty puzzle worth assembling. The film that put Nolan on the map. A psychological film noir breakthrough. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
Although the plot itself isn't terribly complex, the editing is so labyrinthine that multiple viewings are almost certainly necessary.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
The brain-teasing mystery put Christopher Nolan on the map as a filmmaking force...
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
Pearce is positively astounding.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
Nolan's winding timelines and practical stunts are marvels to behold, but they seldom compare to the slow push-in on Leonard's face, as brief but powerful bursts of memory envelop the screen.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
Think of all the ways that a linear film structure stabilizes us - the cause and effect chain of events. But Memento is about a character completely destabilized, so Nolan destabilizes us accordingly in a way maybe no other movie has.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
Memento takes us on a mental trip of recovery, revenge, and remembering.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
Memento would only be half as fun with only one gimmick or the other. Instead, the backward storytelling and the frozen man make for a wonderful pair, combining into something far more redemptive than it sounds.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
Memento isn't just a film with a twist ending; its scatterbrained storytelling literally keeps you guessing with every scene.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
Christopher Nolan's cinematic breakthrough...
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
If the prospect of having to do some of the work yourself doesn't alarm you, then Nolan's first American film is well worth catching, a thriller which is for once authentically Borgesian, to use an overworked qualifier.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
I can't remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
Writer-director Christopher Nolan's second film is one of the most original and ultimately confounding mind games to reach the screen since The Usual Suspects.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
The young British writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has every intention of putting us through the mill, doubles his fun by running the whole story backward.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
The astonishing payoff takes the film to another level entirely, unleashing a battery of existential questions that shed new light on everything that precedes it.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
The three leads are excellent, but it's the masterful execution of an almost-too-clever-for-its-own-good concept which really makes this the most delicious kind of food for the mind.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
Pearce's central performance is as compelling as the film's premise and Nolan's execution of it. In Pearce's hands, Leonard is a time bomb with a short fuse.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
You have to pay close attention to Memento, the most original thriller to come along in years -- and one of the best.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
This terrific movie, about one man's quest for vengeance, does everything a thriller is supposed to do: intrigue, involve and keep you guessing.
 "
Memento,93,94,critic,"
If nothing else, Memento is a savvy comment on the queasy uncertainties of the postmodern condition, in which history goes no further back than yesterday's news.
 "
Following,81,85,audience,This short no-budget feature compensates for its low production value by raising intrigue through shuffled chronology and shows promise for what would become Hollywood's most ambitious director.
Following,81,85,audience,"this is easily one of Nolan's weakest and smallest films with a very small budget and only being black and white. still, it accomplishes its mission of being a excellent story."
Following,81,85,audience,Graet movie super gut
Following,81,85,audience,"Short and on the point, Nolan's debut is a refreshing and smart movie."
Following,81,85,audience,"A riveting web of ruse keeps you tangled by every thread, proving why Nolan is the brain-teasing filmmaker of today. He schemes through your circle like snakes in grass, cunning, sly and organic magic overall."
Following,81,85,audience,"Christopher Nolan has repeatedly proven himself to be one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, and certainly one of the most visionary. His first film, FOLLOWING, was the spark of the fantastic director's amazing career. It's even more astounding to know its backstory, that he didn't write a film and then gather the supplies and money, but instead he saw the supplies and budget he had and wrote a movie that would fit that. Nolan is insanely creative, and crafts a mostly brand new type of triple-cross story in the short but intricate FOLLOWING. It doesn't even feel as short as an hour because there's so much to enjoy and consume. Even though he might be my favorite filmmaker, I can admit when he's mad a faulty movie, like The Prestige or Insomnia. FOLLOWING is not at all one of them."
Following,81,85,audience,"A solid debut and barometer of what was to come of Mr. Nolan's career. Nothing terribly special but a stepping stone. 

Grade- B."
Following,81,85,audience,Very clever. A slow start but the ending delivers.
Following,81,85,audience,"Well written, great twist in the end but Nolan knew that wasn't enough. His love for time is also here. That hair cut surprised me and I had to return again to connect the dots...

Nolan just improves himself, more complex story in future. The only flaws for me would be the restrictions a 6000 dollar movie would have.

Performance were great, specially Cobb. His delivery and charm was beautiful. 2 multiple twist came back to back which might be hard to indulge. 

Ending reminded me of 'Dial M for Murder' where protagonist traps a guy completely from every direction, the perfect murder."
Following,81,85,audience,"Glimpses of what we would come to love about Christopher Nolan are present in this Hitchcockian thriller. Short but sweet, Nolan overcomes the only noticeable flaw (budget) by employing a gripping narrative that refuses to release the audience even after the 70 minutes is up."
Following,81,85,critic,"
Here, though couched in existential ennui, our main character is also stealing in order to survive as an emotional being in a world that has far more grey areas than it does black and white.
 "
Following,81,85,critic,"
The film, compellingly written and directed, manages to be provocative in an understated way...
 "
Following,81,85,critic,"
The exchanges are frequently witty, marked by rapid cuts, and always fuel the story, which is told in director Nolan's signature style: out of order.
 "
Following,81,85,critic,"
Inessential, to be sure, but as an early example of... a fascinating early turn by a heady director first getting his metaphysical feet wet.
 "
Following,81,85,critic,"
The lurid atmosphere of Nolan's early black & white films - his unsettling, hand-held voyeurism - lends itself perfectly to a young body of work which viewers enter through a specific POV, only to have the rug pulled out from under them.
 "
Following,81,85,critic,"
Following is a strong debut by a filmmaker who would go on to be one of the best in his field.
 "
Following,81,85,critic,"
Appropriately, the first shot in Christopher Nolan's feature debut is of a wooden box full of clues...
 "
Following,81,85,critic,"
Following certainly offers evidence to Nolan's now hallmark visual ingenuity - not only with the black-and-white photography but with the quasi-Hitchcockian framing.
 "
Following,81,85,critic,"
Following shows the convenience and inconveniences of coexistence... [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Following,81,85,critic,"
Besides the similarities in playing with time and structure, Nolan is already zeroed in on his favorite cinematic theme: obsession.
 "

Doodlebug,,72,audience,Original and surreal.
Doodlebug,,72,audience,"With a Lynchian atmosphere, Nolan created an ambitious short film that relies on visual metaphors to represent a familiar, yet important, moral message.

The editing in general, and the sound editing in particular, is very exquisite, and intensified the moody and dark atmosphere that matches what the short film indicates very well.

Above all that, Doodlebug proves that Christopher Nolan is a risk-taker from the get-go. 

(9/10)"
Doodlebug,,72,audience,"(80/100)
Killing something unknown to you will bring death upon yourself."
Doodlebug,,72,audience,"A bizarre little experiment, Doodlebug, the debut picture of acclaimed director Christopher Nolan, is a far cry from his recent films, and while it's as cheap as you can imagine, and there's not much you can do within the span of 3 minutes, it does have some hints of cleverness, primarily in how the camera moves to illustration the fright and frustration experienced by our nameless lead character Worth a watch, if only to witness Nolan's extremely humble beginnings. And if you believe it to be completely meaningless rubbish, at least you won't have wasted very much of your time coming to that conclusion."
Doodlebug,,72,audience,Short film. Look it up on YouTube. Worth the 5 minutes. Reminds me of Hitchcock.
Doodlebug,,72,audience,"Christopher Nolan's short film Doodlebug was a really neat look at a man's insanity. At first, this really creepy scene was set with the ticking clocks and the moving cloth. I really didn't know what to expect until it happened. It was a pretty cool paradox! This is an inspiration to make short films for all film makers. A-"

Breathless,97,90,audience,For me this film must be one of the best of the 20th century in terms of cinematography giving birth to the Nouvelle vague of French cinema.
Breathless,97,90,audience,"So this ne'er-do-well slacker who dresses well and has an annoying habit of running his thumb across his lips steals a car and kills a cop. He manages to wrangle his way into an apartment occupied by a pretty girl who sells newspapers on the street, but she doesn't know he's on the lam. The rest of the movie is pretty much him trying to get into her knickers and she being all coy about it.
Turns out he must have gotten into her knickers at least once since she tells him she's knocked up and it might even be his. She finds out about his criminal acts, rats him out and he is killed by cops. That's pretty much it."

Breathless,97,90,audience,"Important more for the innovative steps that the film took with respect to how a film could be made than the actual content. The jump cuts are so visually distinctive and break away from convention that it's difficult not to get caught up in this film, even if the underlying content is so blatantly satirical, from the karate-chop knockout to the back of the neck to the final puff of smoke from Michel (despite having just hobbled down the center of a street with a bullet in his back). The jazz soundtrack is also pretty infectious. (4/5)"
Breathless,97,90,audience,"Maybe its just me, it probably is, but I just don't love this movie. The beginning is energetic, but it loses steam for me after a while. I think Godard gets too much credit for innovation here. Is this ""New Wave"" really that different from Battleship Potemkin? They both deal with the downtrodden, the both make aggressive use of stylized cuts. What exactly was invented here? I don't get it.

I'll have to go read up on it. I really respect the communal intelligence of all the great artists that adore this movie.  Perhaps there's a mental leap that I am missing.  

I'm probably an idiot."
Breathless,97,90,audience,"Qu'est-ce que c'est, Breathless? Such a beautiful movie. In his heyday Jean-Luc Godard was a revolutionary, not only with regard to the techniques of cinematography, but equally within the realm of every day life, turning the superficially banal reveling of a pair of Bonnie and Clyde wannabes into a canvas depicting profound questions that concern us all, questions of life, love, death. His treatment of these matters retains the insouciance of the enfant terrible who still owns the world, recalling to our minds Rimbaud's aphorism, ""Genius is the recovery of childhood at will."""

That Werner Hertzog does not speak Japanese is just one, yet he has managed to pull off something practically impossible and make it look easy, unlabored, and beautiful.

He meets a mother and her baby son and she offers to let him live with her if the boy helps babysit her baby. Eventually she is arrested for being an illegal and the boy must take care of the baby himself. A heartbreaking movie. One of the best I've ever seen. Very well told."
Capernaum,90,93,audience,"Zain Al Rafeaa as twelve-year old Zain is the driving force behind Capernaum, the story of a young boy who deserts his neglectful parents in order to eke out a life on the dangerous streets of Beirut.  Framed between courtroom scenes where Zain sues his parents for bringing him into existence, the story is told through harrowing flashbacks where the protagonist relies on his remarkable intelligence, compassion, and resourcefulness to survive on a day-to-day basis.  His sufferings and his triumphs can be felt in every shot as the hand-held camera probes his daily existence, revealing how instinct and decency can be the salvation of the downtrodden.  Capernaum is a truly inspiration experience."
Capernaum,90,93,audience,"I've watched this movie five times or more. I really liked it. The film focuses on the life of a boy, Zane, who lives in a Beirut slum. Movies are very fascinating and sad.
In ""Capernaum"" they did not shoot professional actors, but people from the street in the literal sense – they were selected there. Shooting on the streets of Lebanon – ""talking"" nature, poverty, grayness. All this makes what is happening so real and authentic that the film looks like a documentary.

The main character Zane is a boy from a poor family, without documents, without a childhood, without a future. The theme is not new, familiar to us from"" children of the dungeon "" Korolenko. But here the naturalness, sincerity of the ""actors"" is striking, you don't doubt for a minute that this is how real people live. No theatrics. Everyday dramas and tragedies are told casually, without pathos. And this only reinforces the impression. 
Zane, who is about 12 years old, works, takes care of the younger children in the family, does not really eat, does not study. Somehow copes with everything, tries to protect her sister from the arbitrariness of her own parents. But the parents give a 10-year-old girl in marriage, but she will die from an early pregnancy. In Iran and Afghanistan, girls are married at the age of 10. And the worst thing is that most girls die from it. This masculine quality of the defender is also evident when he has to take care of someone else's child, the son of a former prostitute trying to survive in a foreign country. It's amazing that in the most dead-end situation, Zane is essentially a child, looking for a way out, acting, fighting. He is honest and straightforward. He sues his parents for giving birth to him for such a life, considering it irresponsible. Another detail and character trait of the hero: faith in justice. 
Despite the fact that he has seen a lot in his life, he still believes that the court will judge everything and correct mistakes. In the film, you can see a very difficult life of people who live in a country that is fighting without restrictions. We must stop the war so that our children do not cry and live a decent life.
 The film is like a very heavy drama, which is not something that makes you think about life, but rather evokes a sense of compassion for people like us. The plot has its own message, which lies on the surface. The film reveals the problem of poverty, corrupt people, hunger, family, marriage, and so on. ""Capernaum"" tells us about all the worst aspects of the above problems and nothing more. Everyone makes conclusions for themselves personally, there is no specific message, except that the message is that you need to love and appreciate what you have. 
The film really deserves to be seen, but the film is clearly designed for one time. But you will not regret watching it, because everything was shot very well, despite all the conditions in which this film was created. And the fact of two awards at the Cannes film festival speaks volumes. By the way the film gets a lot of the best comments"

English abstract

Beginning is a Georgian debut feature that swept the main awards at the last San Sebastian Festival.

Accompany Yana, a woman who abandoned her vocation as an actress to follow and accompany her husband as the leader of a community of Jehovah's Witnesses in a town in Georgia (the country), subject to a subtle domestic machismo and another more explicit social and religious, with guilt and punishment as essential inputs of domination, all this inserted in turn in an absolutely hostile national environment.

Yana's existential crisis, accelerated by an unexpected series of attacks, is radically addressed by the director, with some formal resources taken to the extreme, in a sort of biblical tragedy that goes from poetry to symbolic or verbal violence to physical.

Abstract español

Beginning es una ópera prima georgiana que arrasó con los principales premios del último Festival de San Sebastián. 

Acompaña a Yana, una mujer que abandonó su vocación de actriz para seguir y acompañar a su esposo como líder de una comunidad de Testigos de Jehová en un pueblo de Georgia (el país), sujeta a un sutil machismo doméstico y a otro más explícito social y religioso, con la culpa y el castigo como insumos esenciales de dominación, todo esto inserto a su vez en un entorno nacional absolutamente hostil.

La crisis existencial de Yana, acelerada por una inesperada serie de agresiones, es abordada de manera radical por la directora, con algunos recursos formales llevados al extremo, en una suerte de tragedia bíblica que va de la poesía a la violencia simbólica o verbal a la física.

English Review

Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili) is the wife of the leader of a community of Jehovah's Witnesses in a town in Georgia (the country), where the majority of the population profess the Orthodox Christian faith and sees them with bad eyes. Her community task is to teach classes in preparation for baptism to the children of the congregation. A serious incident in the community meeting room (superbly filmed) determines the departure of her husband for a few days and she is left alone with her son. The unexpected aggressions that she suffers during that absence are added to the buried crisis that she had been going through.

Beginning is the debut feature by the young director Dea Kulumbegashvili that won no less than four major prizes at the 2020 San Sebastian Festival (film, direction, script and leading actress) from the president of the jury Luca Guadagnino and it was selected to represent its country for the Oscars.

How to approach the review of this original and radical film in so many ways?

From the formal point of view, the director virtuously resorts to extremely long fixed shots (that is, shots without cuts where the camera does not move), both for intimate scenes with a hypnotic stillness and for others that do not allow the viewer to escape from a painting of violence. Even more remarkable is the original use of sound out of the field (that is, keeping certain events or characters in a scene out of the picture), with literally disturbing effects. A beautiful photograph is added and an almost total absence of a soundtrack.

Yana is a woman who abandoned her vocation as an actress to follow and accompany her husband. In other words, she chooses to belong to a community where she dominates a subtle domestic and another more explicit social and religious male chovinism, with guilt and punishment as essential inputs for domination. A community in turn inserted into an absolutely hostile national and religious environment.

Yana is a dissatisfied woman who, on the one hand, does not finish assuming her role as a victim, despite the siege of aggressions that is rising around her, but who at the same time is incubating some way to overcome it in those long dead times that her we see transit.

Beginning supports more than one reading. It can be seen as a kind of biblical tragedy that refers in part to the cinema of Dumont and that of Lars Von Trier, where some character perhaps fulfills an allegorical role not because of the obviousness of the script but because of the codes that subdue the protagonist and determine the look her.

Reseña Español 

Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili) es la esposa del líder de una comunidad de Testigos de Jehová en un pueblo de Georgia (el país), donde la mayoría de la población profesa la fe cristiana ortodoxa y los ve con malos ojos. Su tarea comunitaria es impartir clases preparatorias para el bautismo a los niños de la congregación. Un grave incidente en la sala de reuniones de la comunidad (magníficamente filmado) determina la partida de su esposo durante unos días y que ella quede sola con su hijo. Las inesperadas agresiones que padece durante esa ausencia se suman a la soterrada crisis que venía transitando.

Beginning es la ópera prima de la joven directora Dea Kulumbegashvili que ganó nada menos que cuatro premios mayores del Festival de San Sebastián 2020 (película, dirección, guion y actriz protagónica) de manos del presidente del jurado Luca Guadagnino y fue seleccionada para representar a su país para los premios Oscar.

¿Cómo abordar la reseña de esta película original y radical en tantos sentidos?

Desde lo formal, la directora recurre virtuosamente a larguísimos planos fijos (es decir, tomas sin cortes donde la cámara no se mueve), tanto para las escenas intimistas y de una quietud hipnótica como para otras que no permiten escapar al espectador de un cuadro de violencia. Más notable aún es el original uso del sonido fuera de campo (es decir manteniendo en una escena fuera de la imagen ciertos sucesos o personajes), con efectos literalmente inquietantes. Se suma una bella fotografía y una ausencia casi total de banda sonora.

Yana es una mujer que abandonó su vocación de actriz para seguir y acompañar a su esposo. Es decir, que opta por pertenecer a una comunidad donde domina un machismo doméstico (a veces sutil) y explícito social y religioso, con la culpa y el castigo como insumos esenciales de dominación. Una comunidad inserta a su vez en un entorno nacional y religioso absolutamente hostil.

Yana es una mujer insatisfecha que por un lado no termina de asumir su rol de víctima, a pesar del cerco de agresiones que se va levantando alrededor de ella, pero que al mismo tiempo va incubando alguna manera de superarlo en esos largos tiempos muertos que la vemos transitar.

Beginning admite más de una lectura. Puede verse como una suerte de tragedia bíblica que remite en parte al cine de Dumont y al de Lars Von Trier, donde algún personaje cumple acaso un rol alegórico no por una obviedad del guion sino por los códigos que sojuzgan a la protagonista y condicionan su mirada."
Beginning,91,100,audience,What an absolute MASTERPIECE!!!
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
It can be hard to divine much of a difference between beginnings and endings, but there's no mistaking the savage grace with which Kulumbegashvili blurs them together until they're one and the same.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
Important themes but poor execution leads BEGINNING to leave much to be desired. A frustrating viewing experience that fails to sustain interest, it may resonate locally but will face difficulty in crossing over to global audiences.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
""Beginning"" may be a tough watch, both in terms of subject matter and its filmic choices, but it's an acute portrait of a woman awakening.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
It's a film that deserves to be seen, be discussed and win awards.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
A haunting, dreamlike coda to the film shows Kulumbegashvili is a name worth keeping an eye on, as Beginning's biggest flaw is how it can't live up to the amount of potential brimming within it.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
Complex ideas and emotions are presented in a strikingly composed film as bracing as it is unsettling.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
In contemplating the horror of a subservient life, Kulumbegashvili has created a quite extraordinarily compelling film.

 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
For those desperately seeking excellence in cinema, the movie is essential viewing.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
The movie's use of long, static shots and its insistence on showing sexual violence may be almost clichés for this sort of endeavour, but overall there is vitality and conviction in the storytelling.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
Accomplished but unsettling.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
Through this rigorous aesthetic, a distinctive point of view emerges.

When Joan Baez sang ""Hard is the fortune of all womankind,"" she could have predicted that women in Georgia (the nation, not the state)would wholeheartedly agree.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
This is a difficult film arguably more admirable for what it attempts than what it achieves, yet an auspicious debut nonetheless.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
An astonishing film in its assured austerity, confidence and evident lack of compromise.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
If this year sees even a handful of films as beautifully shot as Beginning, it won't have been a total bust.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
All compelling material soon dissipates into a plodding assemblage of static frames within which very little happens...
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
It is an incredible debut: so assured, masterful, and chilling in its tone.
 "
Beginning,91,100,critic,"
[T]here is an intensely ritualistic quality to ""Beginning,"" a remarkable - and remarkably bleak - debut feature... that unfolds with spare, mock-ceremonial deliberation, pausing every so often for an exquisite twist of the knife.
 "
Radiograph of a Family,100,,critic,"
Radiograph of a Family may be the best family memoir documentary since Sarah Polley's Stories We Tell.
 "
Radiograph of a Family,100,,critic,"
[Radiograph of a Family] benefits from exquisite poetic language of such an epic scope that, despite the sadness of the tale being told, it delivers the impression of a masterwork of Persian literature.
 "
Radiograph of a Family,100,,critic,"
Immersive and lyrical.
 "

In doing so she produces a fascinating documentary which encapsulates the contradictions of a nation as a whole.
 "

Inventive and revealing...
 "
The Translator,,,critic,"
Where many other filmmakers who have set films in Syria zoom in on the violence, the directors here concentrate more on the pervasive sense of dread, leaving much to the viewer's imagination.
 "
The Translator,,,critic,"
The strongest moments of The Translator are when it veers into thought-provoking and challenging statements on the power of peaceful protest.
 "
The Translator,,,critic,"
[An] urgent political thriller which examines the difference between speaking the words of others and actually having a voice.
 "
The Bike Thief,,,critic,"
The ending is choppy and abrupt, and Chambers doesn't quite manage to make work the central moral conundrum that life can force us to do crazy stuff to protect our family. It doesn't feel all that pertinent as a tale of Brexit Britain.
 "
The Bike Thief,,,critic,"
Writer/director Matt Chambers has astutely turned his debut feature into an involving story about surviving in an unforgiving world amid the complexities of the current immigrant experience.
 "
The Bike Thief,,,critic,"
An engaging drama that also has something say about the precarious state of people in insecure work. It could be more developed around the edges, but promises interesting things for Matt Chambers.
 "
Amercement,,,critic,"
Worthy of high praise is Evagelinos' confident central performance is this elevated gangster yarn that tries to rustle the features of a somewhat tired genre.
 "
Amercement,,,critic,"
A plangent morality tale steeped in a culture of violence, misogyny and toxic masculinity.
 "
After Love,100,,critic,"
It's a striking debut from British director Aleem Khan that explores the themes of loss, secret lives and cultural assimilation.
 "
After Love,100,,critic,"
It's tough to complain too much about the supporting roles when the movie is such a powerful showcase for Scanlan.
 "
After Love,100,,critic,"
It would do a disservice to viewers and filmmakers alike to divulge more, but After Love is a technically proficient, sincere exploration of its thorny, complicated themes and gripping realist drama of the highest order.
 "
After Love,100,,critic,"
After Love is a quiet little gut punch that sneaks up on you unannounced. Scanlan delivers a masterclass in understated grief, and Khan is certainly one to watch.
 "
After Love,100,,critic,"
The images of Mary and the white cliffs of Dover will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
 "
After Love,100,,critic,"
Anchored by a phenomenal performance by Scanlan, this is an accomplished debut from writer and director Aleem Khan which employs elegant mirrored scenes and repetition to explore the threads that link the two women.
 "
Gullregn,,,critic,"
It lacks the distanced humour and style of some of the recent big hits of Icelandic cinema... but it makes up for it with a big heart.

Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,audience,Brilliant & unguarded doc on an essential Irish poet. This is a pretty great place to start if you aren't too aware of Shane. But Johnny Depp & his fake accent once again wear out their welcome when the only truthful human is the one the documentary is about.
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,audience,A wonderful tribute to one of the greatest!

Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,audience,"Great, vibrant portrait of the legendary Shane McGowan. Watched it twice."
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,audience,"An attempt to glorify and excuse the putridness of addiction under a cloak of ""artistry"" and the lament of ""well, he's Irish, after all"" falls flat and left me with nothing but pity for the man and all those who fall victim to accepting this as a essential part of the artistic process instead of what it is, a broken crutch that assists them in hobbling over the finish line."
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,audience,It is flawless. A MUST see. Compelling from beginning to end. Masterfully weaves a tale that draws you in. Genius at using the music to accentuate the story. Respect for Ireland and Shane.
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,audience,Nothing to date had been complete in displaying Shane Macgowans true genius and struggles. This was a great leap forward.
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
It is, to be certain, a melancholic portrait of a tortured artist whose best work was born out of his worst behaviours. And he knows it.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
Temple lets his audience see first-hand how a man with such a strong presence and infamous reputation is still a rolling, rambling bag of contradictions and complications.

Punk. Poet. Rock legend. There is only one Shane MacGowan, and Crock of Gold captures that legacy.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
In Temple's hands it's more than a rock musical; it's a portrait of a flawed, confronting artist and ardent Irish patriot.
 "

Crock of Gold makes warm, enjoyable work of getting to know [MacGowan] a bit better.
 "

He's reminiscent of Samuel Beckett's character, Molloy, who crawls along contentedly on his belly after losing the use of his legs.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
Temple works hard to make the film hang together, weaving his familiar magic using old audio interviews, animated segments and archive snippets.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
Visually striking and audibly arresting from its opening number until the curtain comes down, Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds with Shane MacGowan is an affectionate paean to its irascible, impudent frontman.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
Temple's made a fascinating film that sets the record straight - in a lot of slurred words - about MacGowan while he's still able to do it. Because, let's be blunt, he's in pretty rough shape.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
The film, directed by Julien Temple with fantastic animation by illustrator Ralph Steadman, delves into MacGowan's youth in an Irish village and the roots of his band's unique fusion of traditional Irish folk music and punk rock.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
He'd be insufferable in a less cheekily fond tribute-but Crock of Gold knows exactly how to appreciate him as an artist while arching an eye at the spectacle he's spent a lifetime making of himself.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
Julien Temple gave Shane MacGowan exactly the documentary he deserves - unruly and full of heart.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
MacGowan fans will relish the sheer exuberance of a film that barrels along with the same hectic passion as a vintage Pogues number.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
In addition to the archival material Temple has shot all sorts of gorgeous new footage in the Irish countryside. And to help tell the tale he's commissioned animated sequences in the visual styles of William Blake, R. Crumb and Ralph Steadman.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
A fascinating, in-depth look at Shane MacGowan, his childhood in rural Ireland, his musical roots and his personal motivation as the preserver of Irish music. Directed by Julien Temple, who is exactly the guy you want for this movie.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
Crock of Gold feels frenetic, much like the music of the Pogues and at first, it's quite dizzying and difficult to penetrate.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
As energetic and meticulous as all of Temple's work, astonishingly full of expertly curated archival material and found footage, narrated, stirringly and slurringly, by MacGowan, who may be slow and sloppy, but is still somewhat witty and somewhat wise.
 "
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,96,94,critic,"
Filmmaker Temple... splashes the artist's mad, messy, pin-wheeling career and opinions onto the screen.

Another Round,92,91,audience,"intelligent, funny, and not an obvious a cautionary tale as one may expect..."
Another Round,92,91,audience,"Maybe the most joyous and entertaining final minutes of any film I've seen this year.

Thomas Vinterberg‘s Another Round poses the question early on of why do we behave, experience, and react as we do? As someone who doesn't and has never had much of an inclination to drink Another Round kind of piqued my interest in this little experiment at least as far as how it might improve my writing, but it's hard not to see how easily said ""experiment"" could go awry and this is what Vinternerg's latest actually intends to chronicle. How does behavior, experiences, and reaction work through and with one another to shape our lives when no matter the order or what dictates what will always depend on the balance one is able to strike with each factor of their existence. Striking that balance, maintaining momentum, energy, and forward motion while still being present enough to enjoy and remember the moments that will define our memories is the trick of the scenario. 

If love is what dreams are made of, then one must accept themselves as fallible in order to give and accept the love of others as well as the life waiting on them should they have the courage to engage in it. Going in knowing your going to hit a few bumps and make a few mistakes makes the wins that much more precious. Mads Mikkelsen's Martin may know this already in the beginning of the film, but by the end he not only is aware of the criticality of this balance, but he understands it; he has lived it."
Another Round,92,91,audience,"Superbly acted and equally brilliant in comedy and in drama, Drunk is like life, bitter and sweet at the same time. A tour de force from Danish director Thomas Vinterberg, devastated by the death of his daughter during production. A true gem of a film."
Another Round,92,91,audience,"Astonishing movie by Thomas Vinterberg, it is satisfying seeing a foreign movie making an impact on the movie industry again. Filled with real midlife crisis problems that are easy to identify with, an intriguing plot, powerful music with an important role and a striking memorable ending. Mads Mikkelson has shown once again what a great actor he is, especially when it comes to emphasizing problems below the surface. The reason why it is not 5 stars, is that I needed deeper elaboration from all the characters included in the so-called ""experiment"", not just Martin's. We should know more about personal lives, underachieved goals and problems which made all of them agree to drink in the first place, resulting in more emotional and sentimental reaction from the audience, thus the better reviews."
Another Round,92,91,audience,"An ambiguous examination...celebration?...of the Danish drinking culture. Is this the secret to their oft-touted status as one of the  world's happiest countries?

Mads is a super-star.  The supporting cast mostly hold their own, which is tough given how much wattage he gives off.

Not exactly entertaining - watching drunked behaviour never is - but certainly engaging. Recommended for its sociological insights."
Another Round,92,91,audience,"""Another Round"" is a fascinating film and one that went a lot deeper than I anticipated. This movie explores mid-life crises as well as the psychology of why people consume alcohol in a very authentic way. It touches on themes of alcoholism but it isn't presented in the same way a lot of other films with similar topics tackle it. I don't know many of the cast members in this movie outside of Mads Mikkelsen, but all four of them do a fantastic job here. Their friendship feels real and I got a good sense of it from the first scene of their interactions together. The movie boasts a very strong ending that feels uplifting, but is also not a complete resolution, just like real life can be sometimes. Overall, this is one of the only foreign-language films I have seen from 2020, but I think most people will find something to relate to it at some level."
Another Round,92,91,audience,Another great film starring Mads Mikkelsen!
Another Round,92,91,audience,"Objectively speaking there's nothing special about this movie. It doesn't look at the problem of alcoholism in any new or original or fresh way. It has typical situations accompanying this calamity and in fact some scenes and characters' actions are even absurd, but still there are some funny and genuine moments coupled with European flavor of the movie. And the movie's optimistic ending evokes nothing but a smile and good feelings."
Another Round,92,91,audience,The Best beer commercial I have seen!
Another Round,92,91,audience,"Another Round (Druk in its native Danish) is a supremely thoughtful film that serves as both dark comedy and intriguing drama. Director Thomas Vinterberg makes vital, ebullient films and this is no different. Much like his previous film The Hunt he manages to delve deep into the human psyche with sometimes startling results. The film concerns itself with four friends who are teachers at a local school. Their lives are somewhat incomplete and stale and when they are out to dinner for the 40th of Nikolaj, he puts out an idea to consider. He suggests they follow the idea of psychiatrist Finn Skarderud, who suggested that having a blood alcohol level of 0.05 makes you more creative and relaxed. Martin jumps at the idea as his marriage and work has become stale and dull and other the friends soon follow. Soon all four are feeling better about themselves and their life and work. But when they decided to up the ante and drink a little more the results are not so good. They become happier in some ways but chaotic in others with eventually tragedy striking. This wonderful film does a great job in informing and entertaining. It's a great commentary on midlife crisis and the upsides and downsides of alcohol. It is anchored by superb performances, but especially by the great Mads Mikkelsen who once again shows his great range of acting skills. An intelligent film of wit and joy and depth."
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
The problem is not alcohol per se, it's the people to use it as a panacea for everything that's wrong in their lives.

Even with all its hijinks, Another Round is a quietly powerful film that has no desire to influence you one way or another.

Shall we dance?

Another Round,92,91,critic,"
Thomas Vinterberg is incredibly astute when it comes to how humans behave in extraordinary circumstances.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
Another Round is heady but absolutely steady.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
Another Round uses its underlying idea to uncork a wealth of sharp and raw insights into men, midlife malaise and group behaviour.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
As a low stakes look at middle age despondency this isn't quite as grim as it could be; while their boozy scheme does help them reconnect with the world around them, it's only ever a temporary solution.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
Ultimately, Another Round depends on Mads Mikkelsen's range and humanity. He gives the film gravity and uplift. He tumbles and soars.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
Audaciously provocative and wickedly funny...
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
More than anything, Vinterberg's film is a coming-of-age fable in reverse, defined in equal measures by merriment and melancholy. And when these potent elements are mixed correctly, the effect is intoxicating.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
I am already anticipating well, er, um, another round with this one. It is unabashedly a crowd pleaser. And there is nothing wrong with that: Skål. Cheers. Bottoms up.

Another Round,92,91,critic,"
[Mads Mikkelsen delivers] one of the best performances of the last year.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
A mature and inspired blend of comedy, tragedy, and human behaviour.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
A film that's as challenging as it is engaging, Another Round overcomes its near-farcical premise with an organic honesty that lends an earnestness to its engrossing narrative.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
I found it unsatisfying on a great many levels, despite the excellent performances of the four actors who play the teachers.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
It's raw, confronting stuff that lays bare one of the main drivers of alcoholism - denial.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
There's a louche '70s swagger to the film, as it follows this tightening band of brothers' increasingly erratic behaviour non-judgementally. The tragicomic tracing of male fragility is fascinating.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
Smart and unflinching, Another Round is classic Vinterberg, and reminds us why Mikkelson has become such a hot property not just in Denmark, but internationally.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
The script, despite generally heading in an inevitable direction, is surprising and complex, with sublime dialogue and fascinating character detail; the cinematography is organic but touched constantly by magic, and the acting is spectacular.
 "
Another Round,92,91,critic,"
These characters aren't over-the-top caricatures. Yes, we laugh at their actions but they're real, honest human beings and many will relate to their problems and their mindset.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
Flecks of hope break through the darkness, but they don't dampen Limbo's emotional power or political substance.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
[Ben] Sharrock directs with grace and patience, the film's pace portraying the sense of an indeterminate period stretching out before its protagonists.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
Ultimately this impeccably judged film wins you over with the sheer strength of its humanity, as it encourages us to see people for all that they were and still can be.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
The defensiveness about portraying the crisis in a realistic, sober, and potentially tragic manner is telling. The danger is that polemics... against grand, sweeping statements may become a means of not saying very much.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
The result is one of the best films ever made about the refugee experience.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
Its genre-melding central conceit never quite comes off in the way that it's aiming for.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
Despite the cinematic strength and emotional intelligence of everything that's come before, the cathartic force of ""Limbo's"" ending is completely unexpected.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
Respectfully toying with the bounds of political correctness, whilst simultaneously laying waste to its hypocrisy with heavy doses of satirical humor, it's a tightrope line which Sharrock walks with relish.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
Limbo is an endearing, intelligent and subtly uplifting piece of filmmaking. Despite moving the audience to some complex places, the film never loses its smile, even as it is being battered by the Scottish wind.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
Limbo approaches its downcast subject matter with an off-kilter, surprisingly hilarious vibe, and with any luck will put writer-director Ben Sharrock firmly on the map.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
It's an instant British classic, but considering the real world systemic failures that are echoed in this story, that doesn't necessarily mean it's something we should be proud of.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
Limbo is confirmation that [Ben Sharrock's] more than just a directing talent: he's the real deal, who can take a Ken Loach-esque subject matter and tell it like a Coen brothers comedy.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
The movie could easily fall into a bland sentimental routine from there, but Sharrock's irreverent tone turns Farhad's journey into a strange and involving one.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
A love note to the displaced.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
[Ben Sharrock's Limbo] provides a deceptively naturalistic look at the physical and emotional reality of the refugee experience.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
[Reveals] how little Sharrock really cares about his characters and their cultural circumstances. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
Sharrock's brand of deadpan perfectly suits the setting, but as funny as the film can be, it doesn't paint a rosy affirmation for Omar and his ilk, stuck as they are, as the title suggests, between countries and lives.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
Frightening in its portrait of sorrow yet far from pedantic in its exploration of asylum-seeking, Limbo is nothing short of sublime, a triumphant feat of storytelling as striking in its visuals as it is in its writing.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
The film thrusts us into this forgotten, snow-lashed corner of the world where a gaggle of lost souls are dumped, awaiting visas. The oddities of islander life are as bemusing to these new arrivals as they are in turn to the largely friendly locals.
 "
Limbo,90,,critic,"
When the film pushes the droll humour of the situation, it actually serves to emphasise the internalised pain suffered by the various characters we follow.

 "

Allen hints at where he's coming from here with his choice of an opening song - ""Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams"" - a jaunty and light tune for a movie stuck in the same delusional headspace.
 "
Rifkin's Festival,56,,critic,"
The latest in a lengthy string of undistinguished bagatelles that might all be described as effortless, and not in an especially complimentary fashion.
 "

Mostly... a pallid reminder of better days we've had with the director.

Like finding an unexpected stash of dessert: not substantial and not nutritious, but sweet enough to remind you in passing of the good times you once had, despite all that's happened in the interim.

Allen may not have found any breakthrough inspiration, but Rifkin's Festival at least has its riffs.

Although cluttered in its approach, the film is deceptively deep: covering sporting ambitions; gender roles and the motivating power of a certain kind of personality.

Zanka Contact is a stylish and exciting watch, delivered with great acting and a catchy theme song, but its tonal shifts and messy plot mean that it never quite finds its feet.

Dating Amber,96,85,audience,Fionn O'Shea and Lola Petticrew have a fantastic chemistry in a film with a lot of heart and charm.  David Freyne wrote and directed this semi autobiographical feature that gets growing up different than the cultural norms.  There are enough laughs here to keep ya going through the slow parts.  Hubby: 7.0 Wife: 8.2 Average 7.6/10
Dating Amber,96,85,audience,So unexpected. Such a good one. Thoroughly enjoyed this. Some great performances and funny/poignant. Rang very true.

Dating Amber,96,85,audience,Actually well done. Finally what the Queer community deserves!
Dating Amber,96,85,audience,Very compelling storyline carried by competent acting and a satisfying ending.
Dating Amber,96,85,audience,"Freyne's tone throughout the first half makes this a weird and interesting coming of age film, even though it draws on themes that have been explored a million times in teen films. Eventually though, it ends up just becoming another one of those films completely with its tropey third act. These are the horniest teens I've ever seen."
Dating Amber,96,85,audience,What a beautiful movie
Dating Amber,96,85,audience,"Really enjoyable, funny, sad but insightful movie about being gay in Ireland at that time. Would highly recommend."
Dating Amber,96,85,audience,"I do believe this film is a must-watch, the storyline fits perfectly, great actors and actresses. 

I specially like the way the lesbian storyline is told, it focuses on both the gay boy and the lesbian girl, leaving behind the so told only gay (boy) themed films we have in the media. Among other things i liked is how we, the viewers get to feel envolved in the things happening, how you get to know and put in Eddie's shoes, so as Amber's shoes.

For me this film is really good just because I want to know more of these people's life."

This patchy paean to a specific place is by turns sumptuous and stagnant, and is most effective in the simple things it does well, such as capturing the glories of nature.

Though interesting up to a point, that point is reached early on as the filmmakers start zooming out to reveal the different layers of artifice involved in selling a cultural experience in a capitalist world...

The result is an ethereal delight, with plenty of ghosts, the past and the present existing at the same time, a tourist guide with social realism and a study of capitalism thrown in as a counterbalance.

It can't work out whether out whether it's a crusading social drama or the story of a troubled artist's redemption. The result is a film that neither engages nor moves the viewer in the way that might have been expected.
 "
Minamata,61,,critic,"
Minamata feels like it could be well timed. However, its poor execution on almost every level prevents emotional coherence and involvement, making this noble fight tiresome.
 "
Minamata,61,,critic,"
""Minamata"" tells a bracing story of corporate malfeasance and bracing advocacy for the underclass, but even the occasional poignant observation can't salvage a movie trying this hard to tug every heartstring at its disposal.
 "
Minamata,61,,critic,"
The film's sacrosanct quest for admiration on the shoulders of its noted protagonist overrides the visceral horrors, its rigidly patrician structure resting on celebrity and a boiler plate narrative.
 "

For a film about photography, it often has bizarrely wrong-headed notions of where the camera ought to be.

Pink Wall,74,67,audience,"Timing, as they say, is everything, as there's almost a sense of deja-vu in actor-turned-writer-director Tom Cullen's debut feature which lands in the same month as Marriage Story and Ordinary Love: another indie two-hander drama, this time, covering 6 years in a relationship between Tatiana Maslany's more ambitious producer Jenna and Jay Duplass's part-time DJ/photographer Leon, who's more of a slacker. Presented non-chronologically, oscillating and juxtaposing, say between their initial encounter in a club and a family gathering in a pub suddenly turned sour in Year 3 or a birthday party at friends that got confrontational in Year 2 or a surprise at home that leads to a sobering argument in Year 4 and so on, the film adopts a snapshot approach in its construction, often in long, static takes that allow the actors to free flow and interact in a seemingly improvisational manner. The result is typically indie and rather conventional for its genre but it's also an honest and authentic portrayal of the beginning and, perhaps, demise of a relationship between two real characters. Despite fine performances by both leads, and Maslany is always immensely watchable in practically anything she's in, there's something missing here that might make this film works better. Maybe there's a lacking of context from how their different approaches in life and work affect their relationship; or maybe it's because I never entirely relate to the two main characters, who could potentially resonate more with a younger audience. In the end, this film simply suffers from comparison with those two similarly themed films recently which carry a more impactful emotional punch, nevertheless this remains a nicely constructed piece of work and a promising debut for Cullen."
Pink Wall,74,67,audience,"Watching two characters you know nothing about, talking in 6 different years about how they want to have a relationship and not able to find out what works for them, doesn´t make much for a interesting viewing experience."
Pink Wall,74,67,critic,"
Strong language and adult themes in intense romantic drama.
 "
Pink Wall,74,67,critic,"
Ultimately, it's a movie that, like many relationships, promises a great deal initially but struggles to build on that.
 "

Both actors are committed, but some extended bouts of navel-gazing dialogue are tiresome.
 "
Pink Wall,74,67,critic,"
An interesting film about two potentially annoying people, that occasionally had flashes...but for most parts, I was just observing the relationship from the outside, not really understanding them.
 "
Pink Wall,74,67,critic,"
[Director Tom] Cullen may pass through familiar waters with Pink Wall, but he still manages to uncover a few small, raw truths about ourselves along the way.
 "
Pink Wall,74,67,critic,"
It's not the first of its kind, but compelling performances allow this portrait of a romance a genuine sense of passion.
 "
Pink Wall,74,67,critic,"
Since Cullen's take on a doomed romance owes more to Haigh than Julian Fellowes, this London-set story is unlikely to set the multiplex on fire. But it's gorgeous all the same.
 "
Pink Wall,74,67,critic,"
Cullen is influenced by Cassavetes and 70s realism, as well as Richard Linklater and his Before trilogy, and there is a gritty, intense quality to Pink Wall. It could be seen as a wilder, indie companion piece to Marriage Story, perhaps.
 "

Pink Wall can be a bit contrived at times, with situations that have been rather effortfully created. But there are strong, forthright performances from Maslany and Duplass as the lovers who were never meant to be.
 "
Pink Wall,74,67,critic,"
This is a promising directorial debut from Weekend actor Tom Cullen, even if his intense, intimate low-budget drama often feels like an extended acting exercise.
 "
Pink Wall,74,67,critic,"
While their roles embrace cliche, the two leads coax out nuance, with Duplass just managing to earn sympathy, and Maslany... continuing to illustrate the stunning breadth of her emotional range.
 "
Pink Wall,74,67,critic,"
What makes it stand out from the well-stocked ranks of indie relationship dramas is the way Cullen plays with traditional gender expectations.

The Shadow of Violence,94,69,audience,"Considering that this was billed as an Irish crime drama, and with that enigmatic and tender title (its original UK title: Calm With Horses), this turns out to be not the film I was expecting. Released cinematically almost a year ago with the lockdown just hitting UK, it landed on streaming soon enough and has recently garnered 4 BAFTA nominations including two surprising supporting nods (the fascinating Barry Keoghan doesn't have a lot to do here and Niamh Algar and Outstanding British Film. Catching up with it now, Nick Rowland's film is, thankfully, not one of those sub-Guy Ritchie gangster film re-set in rural Ireland with a bunch of quirky characters and funny accents. Instead, this is a more grounded affair where a foot soldier who's normally in the background takes centre stage as he's forced to choose between his family and the crime family he finds himself in servitude to. The simplicity of its set up and the straightforward linear narrative structure reflect the fact that the source material is a short story by Colin Barrett, which might also explains why film seems to fade out by the end in a lyrical yet understating manner. Clearly a showcase for debut feature director Rowland and screenwriter Joe Murtagh, they have delivered an engaging emotions-driven story that's heavy on mood and simmering tension. If its depiction of Irish gangsters errs towards the caricature side, they have done a beautiful job nonetheless building up its central character, Arm, the ex-boxer turned gang enforcer, played by Cosmo Jarvis, a British actor of Armenian descent taking up a very convincing West Irish accent. His brooding yet compelling performance makes his flawed character irresistible to an audience who will find much compassion for, despite seeing him pulverizing a man half to death in the first scene."
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,audience,"This Irish gem is 'Screenwriting 101'. Debut screenwriter Joe Murtagh does a fantastic job of keeping his story self contained, tight and clean throughout the film, no useless characters, no meaningless plot points, no unjustified decision.

Directed by Nick Rowland, Calm with Horses follows Douglas 'Arm' Armstrong, played with awe-inspiring dedication by Cosmo Jarvis, whom you may know from HBO's Sci-Fi hit Raised by Wolves, hired muscle for the Devers, a ruthless gangster family ruling over a small Irish town. His immediate superior, best friend and house mate is Dympna, portrayed by Barry Keoghan, the young man who had that spine-chilling evil performance in 2015's The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Niamh Algar (from the same Raised by Wolves) is Ursula, the mother of Douglas' mentally ill boy, Jack.

For the Devers, Douglas is just Arm, a violent lap dog, willing to anything for the illusion of loyalty that he's living in. For Ursula, he is Douglas, the misguided man-child unable to process his own emotions, stuck on the wrong path.

Rowland's film is directed with care from the promising beginning right to the story's gentle and heart-breaking conclusion. The violence is never glorified, but used cleverly as a tool for showing us how messed up, toxic and utterly confusing Douglas' world actually is. A lost soul in a sea of snakes, Douglas makes clumsy attempt after clumsy attempt to redeem himself, each time tragically failing, his confusion and anger growing more and more.

Already written as a fascinating character, Douglas is elevated even more by Jarvis' quietly soul-crushing performance. There's a moment when the camera was centered in a close-up around Jarvis' face but all I saw was Marlon Brando's legendary On the Waterfront performance. Chilling stuff.

The supporing cast shines as well, from Ursula's relatable frustration with how and when did her life end up the way it did, to Dympna's vulnerability showcased in the most perfectly chosen rare moments to a horrifying, nightmare inducing antagonist which I will not name here, you'll know him when you see him.

Amazing effort from Rowland. I will definitely keep following his work. Also, I must admit, I have a soft spot for both Irish centered cinema and street thugs with a heart of gold."
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,audience,"Bullhead already did this and better. Although acting is devoted and cinematography is slick & moody, the story starts as cliched and ends as pointless. The villain appeared much less dangerous than the protagonist, so I didn't get any sense of threat and failed to recognise any kind of meaningful arch. The main character's actions didn't seem to affect the plot at all, but perhaps it was meant to be the whole point."
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,audience,A giant waste of time. I felt like I was robbed of my time. Totally worthless
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,audience,A crime movie with heart.  Writing & acting is remarkable.
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,audience,"No matter what this film is called, Calm with Horses or The Shadow of Violence, it's an absolutely fantastic film from Nick Rowland who has a very limited resume.  Rule of thumb:  If you see Barry Keoghan's name attached, put it on your watch list.  He plays his character perfect as does his co-star Cosmo Jarvis.  It's not necessarily a violent picture, but it undoubtedly does have a violent undertone throughout.  There is a slow build and several payoffs as this screenplay from Joseph Murtagh hits all the right buttons.  Hard to fathom this is Murtagh's first film, but hopefully not his last!  There's a chase scene here that makes you feel like you are there.  It's one of the best not attached to a huge budget you will ever see!  For Americans, you may need to watch with subtitles as these deep Irish accents can be a touch hard to understand with an untrained ear.  It's totally worth it.  You're not going to want to rewind! Very similarly dark to 'The Drop'. Final Score: 9/10"
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,audience,"It was bloody and violent, I was on edge the entire movie, and wanted the young man to change his life.  You felt it was possible but yet  . . ."
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,audience,Marbhadh no a bhith air a mharbhadh. The lad should have tipped the whole brood. The main family give meaning to the word gòrach. It is a peak at the bleak Irish wasteland and their dull witless existence.
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,audience,"Raw, edgy heartfelt, superb cast, highly recommend."
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,audience,It's was good but the ending was crap. Anticlimactic end to the film.I wanted the main guy to kick some ass at the end but he just sat their like an idiot waiting to be killed.
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
A social realist-leaning (and sometimes blackly comic) look at life on the margins, a sharp exploration of toxic masculinity and a potent quest for redemption, too.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
Bleak and suspenseful drama set in the west of Ireland, not about crime but about the criminal lifestyle; and about man and his complex loyalties.

Shakes off well-worn cliches and genre conventions and turns into a provocative, poignant character study.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
The Shadow of Violence has interesting things to say about violence and, ultimately, how far you would go for your family.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
By confronting its inherent moral complexity, the film develops an undercurrent of sympathy beneath the testosterone-fueled, predictably brutal surface.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
The kind of raw, indie gem that is easy to overlook.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
The Irish crime drama The Shadow of Violence delivers a bare-knuckle blow to the heart thanks to a powerhouse performance by Cosmo Jarvis.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
Despite the claustrophobic entrapment in a violent and hyper-masculine world, 'The Shadow of Violence' is an ultimately moving morality tale announcing a confident new voice in international cinema.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
Guided by first-time feature director Nick Rowland, each actor creates their own riveting interpretation of our flawed, beautiful humanity...
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
Built around an incredible central performance by Cosmo Jarvis, with great cinematography and a propulsive soundtrack by Blanck Mass, this film is worth seeking out.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
While Jarvis puts a memorable mug to the script's meditations, you have to squint too much to see director Rowland's signature on this broad idea of machismo.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
The plot is predictable but Rowland's keen direction and Murtagh's poignant script raises The Shadow of Violence well above your average crime drama.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
In addition to this mournful tone and these wise observations, The Shadow of Violence also avoids any sort of formulaic action or resolution.
 "
The Shadow of Violence,94,69,critic,"
There is just enough ambiguity onscreen, particularly during the movie's early stretch, that the narrative machinery isn't too conspicuous.

Mogul Mowgli,96,68,audience,"There is so much meaning to this movie! This shows you a side of a south-asian British born in a house with south Asian culture - we see the clash from ""what I like"" to ""what my culture wants"". It show that we are put in a box from our own people, and from the people outside. Its a masterpiece. I don't want to spend all day on rotten tomato explaining how I felt. I think you would love the movie if you felt racism, or has some anger that we are told to stay in our lane, that ""we"" should go back to our county."
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,audience,"I saw this because my wife, who is from Pakistan, wanted to see it. She was very dissapointed. The film itself is extremely pretentious and disjointed and the acting is self concious. We had the highest hopes for this but it was difficult to make it through the entire film."
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,audience,"Terrible! I can't believe some people are saying this should win an Oscar!! It was one of the most dreary films I've ever seen. They've basically taken a soap opera plot and sold it as a movie. Throughout his illness the main character gets haunted by a guy with flowers over his face?!?!? Seriously!??! And why do we have to get repeated shots of this guy defecting??! That was a bit much. Final verdict, zero stars.....but since you can't give zero, half a star will have to suffice"
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,audience,From his music to his film and tv appearances Riz just seems to get better with time.
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,audience,Powerful and organic! TOBA TEK SINGH!!!
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
Although Riz Ahmed has had many great roles...this is the performance that really lets him stretch his legs. Encompassing his musical talent as well as literally giving everything he has to his character, his writing skills are also showcased.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
British rap drama has cursing and questions about identity.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
It's not afraid to take risks with presentation and narrative, subverting viewer expectations and risking alienation.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
For all its occasional fumbling, Mogul Mowgli fully justifies its existence in every bristling detail of Ahmed's performance, which never plays as self-pitying so much as impatient and hotly aggrieved.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
An uneasy jolt of (pop) culture clash and assimilation angst. Unsettling and electrifying; near-nightmarish and absolutely mesmerizing. Riz Ahmed oozes sweat and rage, pride and power.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
A vibrant and complex exploration of identity, Mogul Mowgli is yet another reminder that Riz Ahmed is having one fantastic year.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
A movie with a lot on its mind and not enough time and space to express it all... bolstered by an electrifying leading performance from co-writer and producer Riz Ahmed.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
Written, produced, acted, and rapped by Riz Ahmed, the artist is enraptured and intensely engaged as Mogul Mowgli is a deeply personal film.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
Ahmed is electrifying in Mogul Mowgli, both as an actor and in the scenes of his fiercely angry rap concerts.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
The central turn from Riz Ahmed has a razor-sharp energy that gives the film a bristly emotional punch.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
Ahmed is at his best in Zed's darkest hour, as he struggles to hold it together in a hospital cubicle. It's blistering stuff.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
There are some slightly challenging fantasy sequences but on the whole this is a really admirable independently made British film, powerful, moving and at times very funny...
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
This is ever so slightly tiresome, but Tariq and Ahmed, who wrote the film, do add humour, and they put lots of energy and bright ideas into Zed's delirious fantasies.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
There are some impressively grandiose set pieces, most notably a concert scene which sees Zed on stage, contorting and snarling, and delivering an MC set that, even allowing for Ahmed's career as an established rapper is striking and memorable.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
Riz Ahmed proves, yet again, to be a galvanising screen presence, taking centre stage...
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
This is abrasive, confrontational film-making, with a machine-gun assault of ideas and influences.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
[Riz]Ahmed delivers yet again a riveting display of emotional vulnerability and grittiness in Bassam Tariq's Mogul Mowgli.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
It doesn't explain things for you, but tells its story in a way you can absolutely keep up. Impressive with a real urgency to it...
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
Ahmed socks you with an electrifying turn; his film, however, is more diffuse.
 "
Mogul Mowgli,96,68,critic,"
Culturally rich and emotionally raw, Mogul Mowgli is a brilliant showcase for Riz Ahmed's bevy of talents, and speaks visceral truth to the British-South Asian experience so rarely explored on screen.

The Painter and the Thief,96,85,audience,"The Painter and the Thief lost its steam in the second half, it lacked a bigger purpose and the runtime is too long, but the first half is excellent and the movie is fascinating in the titular complex psychosexual artist-muse relationship that was very well explored through many insightful and thematically rich conversations."
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,audience,"A well-crafted look at our weakness for destruction.  A backdoor, not unlike the one Milgram shone light on."
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,audience,"As there is more than one way to skin a cat, there are also many ways to sell an artist. We may see ""Swan Song"" become a 6 figured painting in the next few years."
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,audience,Left me still thinkimg about the movie hours afterwards and googling the artist and her thief.
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,audience,"A great documentary about 2 people I ended up really caring about. Warm and heartfelt.  The film maker was completely invisible...made me wonder at times what was set-up / rehearsed and what was naturally occuring. In the end I didn't care too much about the process, I was so involved with the unfolding human drama. These are complex lives captured without judgement. I loved it."
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,audience,"Film is about real people - a painter and the thief that stole her paintings, and the way she dealt with him with compassion."
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,audience,I didn't realise this film was a documentary till the credits came up at the end.  Blimey it took four years to shoot. Apart from that It was a brilliant film. The best script writer in the world could not have done better. Great camera work......and great personalities...Forget the word 'acting' as this was a true story unfolding infront of a camera.
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,audience,The movie is well worth watching. Her subject choice however....
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,audience,"Barbora Kysilkova is a better person than I am. Well, she has a capacity for empathy and compassion that is perhaps a bit too difficult for me to get to as easily as she apparently can. This is a remarkable work; not merely as a great film but also for its display of the fortitude and resiliency of the human spirit and the capacity to see the worth in those who seem like lost causes but who are not. By seeing that innate potential for value in others who are self-destructive or otherwise may appear as little more than vagrants, addicts, bums, we can help those same people rise from the ruins as Bertil does here. That can also have very real healing, empowering potential for those like Barbora as well. 
Benjamin Ree has made an extremely interesting, visually and psychologically arresting film. Exceptional camera work as well. Check this out. 4 stars."
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,audience,"This weekend, thanks to IDA (International Documentary Association), I was given the opportunity to watch Norwegian filmmaker Benjamin Ree's documentary, ""The Painter and the Thief."" The film follows the 3 year journey of Czech artist living in Norway, Barbora Kysilkova, and her attempt to locate several of her paintings stolen from an art gallery. Barbora connects at the trial with caught ringleader, Karl-Bertil Nordland, a career criminal fighting a heroin addiction and a (possibly)feigned memory loss of the theft, and offers to paint his self-portrait, in  hopes this may help her find out the whereabouts of the stolen paintings. What follows this initial meeting between the two is an unexpected friendship and empathetic bond over the next 3 years. Without giving anything away, the documentary's ending is rather extraordinary."
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
The film can't make the case that the story, while unusual, is inherently interesting. Odd couples have existed since time immemorial, and Ree never illuminates these two people enough to make their stories worthy of a documentary.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
A true-crime tale reconfigured into a unique relationship saga, replete with twists, turns, heartbreak, failure and redemption that's as surprising as it is well-earned.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
A story full of twists... as orthodox in its forms as it is exciting. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
This is a fascinating documentary film that is chock full of surprises.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
[An] astonishing and completely unexpected documentary.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
Playing out as a fascinating dramatic narrative, this documentary unfolds its story using found footage, surveillance cameras and remarkably intimate fly-on-the-wall sequences.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
The Painter and the Thief has more human interest, more narrative urgency, than most feature films.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
Benjamin Ree's extraordinary documentary feels like a movie - there's a heist, villains who are not what they seem, scenes of striking intimacy and some fabulous twists.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
Fascinating, confounding and continually surprising...
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
The story's twists and turns are too good to risk ruining in a review, but suffice to say that the film stands as a genuine testament to the way art can transform the lives of those who make it and those who appreciate it...
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
A beautiful story about extraordinary compassion.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
What an engrossing film - and the gender reversal of a male muse inspiring a female painter has got to be one small step for art-world equality.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
The beauty of the film is that this is life lived, in all its infinite strangeness - a grand tableau of intercrossed destinies, friendship and disaster, fjords and gangsters.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
Benjamin Ree's intriguing documentary is an arresting portrait of the human connection... The Painter and the Thief paints the institutional failure of the criminal justice system while unfurling the pervading power of art.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
Full of infectious fascination, The Painter and the Thief is a compassionate, entertaining and substantial stranger-than-fiction tale, while it's as gorgeously shot as you'd hope from a documentary about art.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
Norwegian filmmaker Benjamin Ree's The Painter and the Thief is an art heist film like no other and an arresting documentary of startling, often brutal, emotional honesty.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
It's exactly the kind of warm, hopeful film that 2020 needs.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
Ree will no doubt be the envy of the documentary world for stumbling upon such a unique story, but it is through his largely air-tight structuring that this story truly reveals itself and a friendship flourishes.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
One of of the most surprising documentaries of the year.
 "
The Painter and the Thief,96,85,critic,"
A revelatory piece of filmmaking. The Painter and The Thief is a fascinating portrait of two complex, conflicted people told with depth and an eye on beauty.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
This film is like an insider's view of Cuba, and it consists mainly of street scenes in and around Havana, loosely strung along a theme relating to the Cuban War of Independence and the Spanish-American War.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
Acting as his own cinematographer in Havana, Sauper ventures off the tourist track with his camera.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
Epicentro is an intimate, fluid, ethereal film while still being sharp edged in condemnation of the globalization and colonial history. It's one of the truly great documentaries of 2020.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
If one can't find utopia on the sunny beaches of Cuba, one might not find it elsewhere.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
As waves crash against the Malecón esplanade, Epicentro reminds us of the myths that we build our lives upon; some of us believe in the myth of building walls and some of us cry at the death of our mythical leaders.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
Sauper's Epicentro takes what feels like a last, nostalgic pulse-taking of Fidel's Havana-physically decaying but still full of cultural life-before what seems an inevitable eventual return to external capitalist exploitation.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
A brazenly experimental feature, Epicentro is a textured and provocative look at the trail left by a history of colonialism, both literal and more figuratively.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
Epicentro isn't so much a wide-ranging documentary as it is a compilation of random individuals in Cuba who share their thoughts for this movie. What they have to say is much more revealing about Cuba than filtered news or a political speech.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
The mood he strikes is discordant with the material-not a problem in and of itself, but indicative of how self-reflexivity can slip into noncommittal indulgence.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
The truth at our convenience
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
Sauper isn't trying to fool anyone, but he is a filmmaker, and that's how the medium works.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
An ambitious, multi-layered documentary, Epicentro... will reward you for sticking with it.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
From visual beauty to its cultural and artistic distinctions to sociopolitical challenges, the uneven film takes an affectionate approach toward its subjects.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
Alongside the 1964 classic ""I am Cuba"", this stands as one of the greatest documentaries ever made about Cuba and reinforces the need to end end the embargo.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
...regardless of [Sauper's] self-awareness, Epicentro is a really thought-provoking study of modern day Cuba and its history.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
At once mesmerizing and self-questioning.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
There's an alluringly observant, searching quality to Sauper's direction. He takes audiences on an enlightening journey
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
This lack of objectivity is blatant . . . and as part impressionistic work and part ethnography, Epicentro often turns counterintuitive into crucial.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
Epicentro ... stands as a monumental tribute to a place deserving of better than it normally gets.
 "
Epicentro,93,,critic,"
Whether Sauper's travels delivered a cohesive movie this time is debatable, but what he does find is always interesting.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,audience,"Have I mentioned how much I love high concept movies? Especially another wildly original and visually gorgeous turn from Benson and Moorhead. It's an engaging, original sci-fi flick, with a solid lead performance from Mackie."
Synchronic,80,76,audience,"I really feel for Moorhead and Benson, writers/directors of Synchronic.  Because their earlier films The Endless (2018) and Resolution (2012) have set such a high bar.  In those two films they really brought the weird and the cosmic horror and did it oh-so-well.  And so, perhaps in a similar way to M. Night Shylaman, it will always be hard to live up to early success.  If you start so strong it's harder to keep impressing people."
Synchronic,80,76,audience,"Synchronic is a wildly original SF movie with a different spin on the regular time travel movie. The film truthfully posits that the present is the best period and all of the past periods were infinitely worse. I loved that about this movie, but everything else was very problematic. The execution was so troublesome throughout. The pacing is entirely off in both halves, the characterization is poor and although it is somewhat artistic, the movie also felt cheap technically speaking. This high-concept premise deserved much better execution."
Synchronic,80,76,audience,"A simple premise.  Not overdressed,  not overwrought,  just a simple could- happen- to- anyone plot.  
The context is  a good longstanding male friendship exploring a snapshot in the lives of both men. We are allowed to see the glue which has kept them working and socialising over the years: one a serial monogamist, the other a family man, both  hardworking, both dealing with introspetion on midlife angst, through the contrasting experiences of  boredom with domesticity, and the discovery of terminal illness. Amazingly,  although still close,  this soul searching occurs individually despite much sharing of daily life. The beauty is how both  experiences are masterfully woven  together to tell the story. This parallel yet conjoined process is what makes this such a good film.  
The story is clever,  simple,  scifi dressed up as drama- mystery. The film is a fresh look at inevitability of life and how regular people can learn to appreciate and grow from challenges. Not a sugar and cream story,  more veggies and Tuesday Dinner meatloaf.
The tale is well-paced,  with a simple, yet clever, time-travel Eschewing fancy cgi, this is the movie Tenet wanted to be before it put on all that extra weight."
Synchronic,80,76,audience,"A decent film. It was clearly a cheap production, though. I don't have strong feelings either way for this film. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind-blowing, either."
Synchronic,80,76,audience,"Anthony Mackie & Jamie Dornan turn fantastic chemistry into a fun film led by the continued brilliance of the film making duo of Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead.  It's about time travel and relationships and if you go with it you're gonna love it.  The movie is explained well and the ending, which I didn't like at first, is growing on me.  If you're into the Benson/Moorhead genre then this is for you!! Final Score: 9/10"
Synchronic,80,76,audience,"Artistic, dark, unique, and intriguing."
Synchronic,80,76,audience,Great exemple on how to make a shitty movie from a good idea.
Synchronic,80,76,audience,It doesn't make as much sense and it thinks it does.
Synchronic,80,76,audience,"The sci-fi premise works due to an emotionally grounded story, strong directing and Mackie's engaging performance."
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Mackie and Dornan's sincere work knows how to provide an authenticity rarely achieved in [these kinds] of proposals, usually more concerned with prioritizing spectacle over the dramatic arc. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
The film's tight running time leaves [the emotional angle] comparatively starved for attention, and empathy levels generated by the film suffer for it. Still, there are enough intelligently-approached ideas to keep SYNCHRONIC engaging and smart.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Despite its messiness, Synchronic is suitably weird and sufficiently fun.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Mackie and Dornan do their best with their intrepid characters (though Dornan is sidelined for much of the time), while the women have little opportunity to register as interesting characters.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
But something about the film just did not hit the mark for me. Despite the attempt at tension and cool sci fi stuff, Synchronic struggled to hold my attention.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
When a movie takes you on the kind of ride that Synchronic does, in such a stunning, sharp and thrilling fashion, and with such depth at is core, its tiny imperfections fade from memory quickly.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
The attempt to make a different sort of time and reality blurring narrative is admirable, but Synchronic never gels into something truly satisfying.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Benson and Moorhead plunge viewers into a woozy existential nightmare to deliver a message that is at once bleak and beautiful.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Moorhead and Benson deliver another multi-genre drama with a broad scope, this time with a bigger budget and bigger cast. Afraid I miss their less mature style though.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Mackie and Dornan are both fine, though the script gives them nothing much to do except banter and argue.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Less successfully realized is the bond between the two heroes. Dornan is not as badly miscast here as he was in Fifty Shades of Grey, but Dennis is never a terribly engaging character.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
A sci-fi inflected story...this might be the least successful of the creators' films, it does look a bit on the cheap...the initial idea is really interesting, but when you get down to it, it's a straight-to-video B movie...
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Moorhead and Benson deliver enough to put this film above more forgettable fare.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Moody and strange, this offbeat dramatic horror spirals to heights of absurdity that are grounded in a nicely played central relationship.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
The Capote Tapes show a talent that seemed to go to waste while at the same time teasing us with the possibility that there is more yet to come.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
An enthrallingly complex film, one that deserves second viewing and will mature well with age. But mostly, it's a film that speaks of the directors' great imagination and near-genius.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
By turns gloomy (heavy shadows, ominous score) and deeply goofy (see plot premise), the film is underpinned by some easygoing chemistry between the co-leads, Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Like Brandon Cronenberg's recent Possessor, this is bold, ideas-driven sci-fi horror told with real flair.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Synchronic is a thoughtful twist on the genre.
 "
Synchronic,80,76,critic,"
Now they've been trusted with a bigger budget and bigger stars for their latest film, SYNCHRONIC. They stay true to their themes of brotherhood and cosmic happenings, but on a much larger scale that proves their talents as filmmakers.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,audience,"A double dose of Seth Rogen and an hilarious premise doesn't save the movie from its hesitant direction, lack of real jokes and unfocused subject matter."
An American Pickle,72,46,audience,"Not as cool as a cucumber, quite a bit more briny.
This is the attempted comedy of an American migrant who falls in a pickle vat and is perfectly preserved only to be reconstituted 100 years later.  My very favourite scene was the big press conference with the scientists trying to explain how this has happened.  And they do a delightful narrative voice over to say ""The scientist was smart and his logic was good - everyone was satisfied."""
An American Pickle,72,46,audience,"Good concept, not funny, poorly executed. "
An American Pickle,72,46,audience,"Did NOT expect this to have much depth; instead, I was captivated by Seth's dynamic dual performance. Truly a delightful film filled with enough subtle wit and the right amount of tender cheese to pair well with the obvious Rogen-style (vulnerable, neurotic, awkward guy) comedy, which he effortlessly nails. I'll be watching it again."
An American Pickle,72,46,audience,"I don't know why people are giving it such a bad review. It was funny, had a good story, and had great acting. Seriously, if you have HBO Max I suggest watching it."
An American Pickle,72,46,audience,"An American Pickle is a small, enjoyable film. It's limited to be sure, but a pleasant diversion nonetheless. It's a parable of sorts as Seth Rogen plays two roles. Herschel Greenbaum and his great grandson Ben. Yes, it's a time travel film. We start with Herschel, stuck in a life of poverty in Eastern Europe in 1917. He leaves this world and emigrates to America with his new wife. He starts works in a pickle factory, but one day falls into a vat which is then sealed. 100 years later he is discovered in the condemned factory by two boys. It's a miracle as the brine has pickled him. Of course it's very fanciful and soon he meets Ben, an app developer living in Brooklyn. It follows the familiar line of person from the past being stunned by modern technology. It has been done before but while not offering anything especially new it's still nicely enjoyable. Herschel starts a pickle business whilst Ben struggle to get finance for his app. It's a clash of not only generations but wills. I wouldn't say Rogen is a great actor by any means but he does have a certain charming likeablity. There are nice comments here on modern life but the film does fall somewhere in the middle. It's not funny enough to be a true comedy and not heavy enough to be a true drama. Enjoyable in parts is probably the best description."
An American Pickle,72,46,audience,This was really cute. I liked the story a lot. Anyone with immigrant grandparents will enjoy this.
An American Pickle,72,46,audience,"This movie was a very interesting and different take of a film especially for this year, also a different take seeing Seth Rogen doing a great job playing both these characters. This movie gave a good perspective to how much our world really has changed so very much even in small things, and how it would probably realistically feel to someone coming from 100 years ago to todays world. Gives you a touching bond thats gained from two family members from two very different time periods. It isn't a full out comedy, you would expect from Rogen but still has many laughs and great focus points. Hope to see more like this and better."
An American Pickle,72,46,audience,I really enjoyed it. Plenty of funny moments
An American Pickle,72,46,audience,"An intriguingly humorous concept that in itself could be rewarded with laughter, but An American Pickle ends up on the flat side of the comedy film spectrum and never truly takes flight."
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
The charmingly absurd - and occasionally absurdly charming - comedy sees Rogen portraying two characters and sharing a great many scenes with himself.

An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
An American Pickle requires its viewers to suspend a lot of disbelief, but those willing to go along for the ride will find much to entertain them. Twice the Rogen ensures the film works most of the way through.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
An American Pickle  can't save its muddled self from plot points that fizzle and a script full of dead air.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
The comedy is broad but the heart of the story, the sense of the importance of family, inner strength and the feeling of displacement immigrants often feel in a new land are all handled sensitively.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
A Greenbaum versus Greenbaum conflict erupts midway, a patience-testing contrivance meant to illustrate the superiority of the old ways, but only serves to highlight the sloppy screenwriting.
 "

Rogen's excellent performances make An American Pickle worth spending time with.

An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
The various visual and staging techniques that allow Rogen to act opposite himself are invisible, and the film delivers consistent amusement.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
Its premise may sound quaint, but the whimsy of An American Pickle helps nurture all kinds of delicate emotions.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
An American Pickle is a superficial portrait of Jewish experience in the New World and a corny rags-to-riches story of immigration.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
Really too scattered to be as satirical as it obviously wants to be, and losing a little steam into the final act, this nevertheless demonstrates that, yes, Rogen can truly act, and that he's quite the mensch too.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
The ideas are in place for ""An American Pickle"" and the movie offers plenty of offbeat pleasures, but the screenplay could have used a little more focus on the deeper topics.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
An American Pickle is far from a disaster, but it is more amusing than hilarious. It is that thing a comedy can never be -- only half good.

...this is certainly no unheralded masterpiece, but it does offer plenty of laughs and some good vibes...

It may not be a perfect vehicle for Simon Rich's but Seth Rogen is a remarkable conduit for his sense of humor. Rogen deserves a lot of credit for pulling off the dual roles.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
While it looks lovely, An American Pickle is ultimately out of step with the times in which it finds itself.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
The plot becomes increasingly directionless, while Ben's vindictive nature and Herschel's politically incorrect outbursts make both men difficult to warm to.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
The result is a heartwarming, funny, and ultimately very Jewish story about hardship, loss, and the redemption we can find in ourselves and each other -- no matter how far away it sometimes feels.
 "
An American Pickle,72,46,critic,"
Having sufficiently lowered expectations by brining the lowest hanging comedic fruit, An American Pickle pulls off a very deft sleight of hand when the whole thing comes to a surprisingly touching conclusion.

The Beach House,80,27,audience,"My wife and I saw that this movie had received an 80% from critics and was looking for a good ""scare"" to watch. Boy- could critics have not been farther off. This isn't really a movie, but more of an experiment in boredom. A total rip-off of ""The Fog"", except set on an unknown beach in California? It is neither scary nor good. Poor backstory (actually no backstory) and a cast of four people, who don't seem to know what or even why they are in this film. Basically, deadly fog rolls in- some bad/weird things happen- people wander off/disappear without purpose - a couple  breaks into a house- only to become spawn people- and in the end- washed out to sea. Sound bad- it is. Do Not Waste Your Time!"
The Beach House,80,27,audience,"What an absolute waste of time. This was in no way scary, just gross and uncreative."
The Beach House,80,27,audience,"There were things The Beach House did well, and things it didn't do well. The premise stepped away from what the Horror genre has been trending toward in a daring move that I enjoyed. It also didn't rely on tradition scares and tropes to create it's dreading atmosphere. However, it felt oddly paced, too suddenly into the action but at the same time dragging through scenes that made the movie feel both too long and too short. It left things to be desired. Overall, though, it was a solid attempt at a sci-fi apocalyptic tale that managed to entertain and intrigue."
The Beach House,80,27,audience,"Not just low-budget, but low-effort as well."
The Beach House,80,27,audience,Tried to see this movie but eventually I get bored and abandonded at some point
The Beach House,80,27,audience,"A young couple looking forward a getaway at his father's beach house turns into a fight for survival.  After spending the night with an older couple, a strange fog envelops the area causing a strange sickness. 
The setup for what was to come was engaging, although I didn't think the payoff was very strong, but it was well performed and kept my interest."
The Beach House,80,27,audience,"THE BEACH HOUSE has plenty to recommend it.  Lots of things are done right, some of them very right.  But when it comes down to it, 99% of movies will only really ""thrive"" if the writing is solid and the acting is good.  THE BEACH HOUSE fumbles those basics, and is much diminished thereby.

It tells the story of a young couple who decide to spend the weekend at his father's beach house during the off season. A getaway with the purpose of reconnecting.  Turns out, one of dad's best friends from years ago is ALSO staying there, so the two couples with very little in common agree to be ""roomies.""  They spend an evening drinking and bonding, but by morning, things are beginning to go very wrong.

Something, a kind of infection, I suppose, has arisen from the depths of the ocean and is infecting the four reluctant roommates.  This manifests itself in different ways, but all of them are actually fairly effective, particularly for such a low budget film.  Worms digging into the bottom of a foot are always going to get you on a gut level if rendered realistically, and these are.  The gross out moments in the film are few, but they are effective.  There's also lots of creepy atmosphere created, and that's pretty impactful as well.  While the exact nature of the ""attack"" on humankind is never fleshed out, we're left little doubt that it's pretty bad.  (We hear, vaguely, on a background radio a scientist speaking of an ""extinction event."")  

So, all is good, right.  Creepy atmosphere and some genuine scares.  What else do you need?  Well, first of all, the script is pretty shaky.  No one is written to really speak in a quite believable way.  Not the weird stuff they say once possessed, but just the normal stuff people say when we're getting to know their characters and underlying motivations.  And sometimes, a marginal script CAN be rescued by good actors.  With the exception of Jake Weber (a very experience actor), everyone on the screen is unknown, including the actress playing Weber's wife, who has NO prior acting credits (at least in film or TV).  The results are that our two young leads are bland and have less than zero chemistry.  This idea that they're trying to reconnect is not believable for one second.  She surely doesn't care one whit about him, and he mostly seems to want folks to understand why he doesn't believe college is right for him.  The characters are uniformly boring and generic.

So why do I even muster up 2.5 stars?  Well, as indicated, there is a lot of filmmaking skill here on the technical side.  Editing, cinematography, SFX, even sound are well done.  And the budget is so low, it makes those elements all the more admirable.  So it's just on the edge of being recommended.  We might be seeing the emergence of an interesting new filmmaker (but just as likely, not).  Writer/director Jeffrey A. Brown should perhaps consider finding a writing partner, and just focus on his strong eye for visuals and editing.  Then we might really have something."
The Beach House,80,27,audience,"The Beach House starts out strong, and at least tries to put some character development in the first quarter of the movie. The setting is also picked nicely and offers a refreshment to the typical horror movie scenery. The actual plot starts out very strong, and also adds some nice body horror, which is sadly not continued through the rest of the movie. After the first half however, the diverse and interesting character of the story starts to fade, and is replaced by a rather stereotypical and dull continuation, which crescendos in an unsatisfying ending, after some last scares. 

All in all, Beach House attempts to create his very own character, and does so nicely in the first part of the movie, but loses a lot of its flavour in the second half. Considering the small budget, and the fact that it was Jeffrey A. Browns first ever movie, the movie provides some entertainment, and some smaller scares as well. I would recommend this movie to someone looking for a Horror movie that differs from the typical Slasher, and doesnt have a problem with a bit less graphical show off."
The Beach House,80,27,audience,"The first half of this film picks on a slow pacing of the story. But by then, The Beach House is already clouded with mysteries to look upon instead of horror that's why you'll get easily invested to it. It was on the second half of the film that I felt that the true story of the film gets establish and full throttle in action. It wasn't scary if this is catered as a horror film but it is leaning about science-fiction genre. And thought it wasn't that scary at all, the film is a decent science-fiction horror. It also compensates for a great set of cast and a few sets of thriller and suspense scenes in between. The story of the film is decent though, I did not find the ending satisfying as it ended raising more questions and wonders about the story rather than having a satisfying end. 
The Beach House tells a story of college-aged couple who take on vacation on a beach house and then befriended an older couple for a night bonding when they are suddenly threatened for survival by a mysterious infection that spreads across the coast."
The Beach House,80,27,audience,"The Beach House is a smart and compelling horror. It creates an apocalyptic atmosphere, with some handy camerawork adding to it. A strong build leads to a slight anti-climatic finish, but this is worth a visit."
The Beach House,80,27,critic,"
The first moment of true tension in 'The Beach House' doesn't occur until ten minutes before the credits role. The rest is about as interesting as that sentence implies.

Low-budget cosmic horror with some truly grotesque imagery. The film might be a bit slow for some, but others will be rewarded with their patience.

With a dash of Cronenberg and a touch of COVID paranoia, ""The Beach House"" is a legitimately compelling horror film.

The Beach House fits right into it's ""body horror"" mold. It's effective, gruesome, and even thought provoking. It's not going to win any awards, but at least it can stand next to most of it's genre brethren. And eat BEFORE watching.

Quietly insidious, this low-key horror slowly builds up a head of steam but still leaves characters very sketchy.
 "
The Beach House,80,27,critic,"
The film was made in 2019, and while Jeffrey A. Brown couldn't have known what 2020 would bring, his debut would presciently tackle themes of isolation, paranoia, and environmental upheaval.

Science fiction is the companion to horror, fear of the known and unknown go hand in hand creating numerous opportunities to get creative and that exactly what writer and director Jeffrey A. Brown has done.
 "

Rather drably-played formula, swiping a bit from Stephen King (""The Mist"") here, a little ""Night of the Living Dead"" there.

Jump Shot: The Kenny Sailors Story,100,98,audience,"This documentary is great time! The man it is about is very interesting person who has lived a long and storied life. It is very well paced and moves along at a good speed, not dwelling on any one part of the man's life to the exclusion of others. There is a good selection of people interviewed, both family and friends, and fellow basketball professionals. Kenny Sailors is a good person to base a documentary on; he is charming and funny, and surprisingly profound at times. 
The film has basic animated sections that help illustrate Sailors' life in a cool way and add moments of comedy. The story is engaging as it tells the story of a man who hasn't always been recognised for his many accomplishments. The only thing I would change is to make the film longer, and go into more detail about Kenny Sailors' life outside of basketball. Overall, worth a watch!"
Jump Shot: The Kenny Sailors Story,100,98,audience,"A great movie about a classic American story. As a fan of basketball myself I never even knew the details to the origin of the jump shot, however through this film, viewers learn the fascinating story of how a sport was changed forever. Great movie, great production, must watch for all basketball fans"
Jump Shot: The Kenny Sailors Story,100,98,audience,"The jump shot is such an integral piece of the game of basketball that one would think whoever introduced it to the sport would be a household name. However, to many, the late Kenny Sailors remains an enigma. This documentary aims to correct that error in the public memory. Using a mix of an elderly Sailors, archival content, unique animation and stellar interviews with famous faces from the world of basketball, it weaves the fascinating story of one man's life, the game that he played and the greater purposes that he pursued.

While the film is as thrilling and inspiring as a narrative feature. it is more than just a sports movie, as Sailors himself would likely insist. His life had many different layers, layers that contributed to his fading from fame but make for compelling viewing for anyone, sports fan or not. Always captivating subjects and uniquely formatted visuals keep the story tight and concise from beginning to end. In keeping the memory of a basketball titan alive, ""Jump Shot"" shoots and scores."
Jump Shot: The Kenny Sailors Story,100,98,audience,"Kenny Sailors is an inspiration to all who know his story. His compelling journey leaves the audience in awe of his determination and resilience, as he created one of the most important shot techniques used in the game today. Totally worth watching!"
Jump Shot: The Kenny Sailors Story,100,98,audience,"I really enjoyed Jump Shot even more then I thought I would. I went into the movie thinking it would be all about the history of the game, and focused being about what a basketball player brought to the court. The movie did tell a story a short about a Kenney Sailor and what he brought to the court. However, it also showed that he brought more then strength to the game.  I found it very inspiring that he influenced so many peoples life for the better. It was really interesting to hear that he fought so hard for a girls basketball team. I see as a fight for the girls to be seen as strong, for them to know that somewhere is there who believes in them and will fight for them. Kenny Sailors deserves to be added to all the sport Hall a Fames, not just because of the Jump Shot but because he changed so many lives. In the same token being the man Kenney Sailor was, I do not believe the fact the he is not added just adds to the kind of man he was."

Highly recommend for documentary and basketball fans alike."
Jump Shot: The Kenny Sailors Story,100,98,audience,"I'm not a huge sports guy, so Jump Shot really took me by surprise. This is a lot more than the origin of the jump shot, it's a portrait of a modern day saint. Kenny Sailors is who I want to be when I grow up. He has an immense sense of kindness and joy that radiates out of him and into the movie. I left this film feeling inspired and hopeful, emotions that are in short supply right now."
Jump Shot: The Kenny Sailors Story,100,98,audience,"Jump Shot depicts Kenny Sailors not only as one of basketball's original masterminds, but as a true man of God. Jake Hamilton's direction of this amazing passion project made it a must see for every sports fan around."

The Way Back,83,84,audience,"I love basketball and I love Gavin O'Connor movies so it's not a shock that I love this movie. A heart wrenching story combined with some fun basketball scenes and an overlooked Oscar-worthy performance by Ben Affleck help make this movie great. More than anything, I love how human this movie feels. From the dialogue to the places the story goes, everything feels so real and genuine. Great movie. 5/5."
The Way Back,83,84,audience,"This is raw, inspirational and must be Affleck's best performance, just the ending doesn't land"
The Way Back,83,84,audience,Great Ben Affleck performance. A movie that touch your heart.
The Way Back,83,84,audience,"Movies with similar topics have been told many times but what separates this movie is the performance of Ben Affleck, the emotions, body language, everything he do sucks you into the movie and root for him to his road to redemption."
The Way Back,83,84,audience,Ben Affleck is excellent in this. Thought this movie was very good. Sad. Realistic. Was rooting for Ben’s character. The ending was a bit of a let down for me though.
The Way Back,83,84,audience,"I feel like we've seen this story before, several times from different angles, so I'm skeptical going in.  Without any expectations it's hard to disappoint and it didn't, but without any surprises or twists it's just kinda okay if you like seeing a high school basketball coach be drunk for 90 minutes before hitting rock bottom, having a moment of clarity, and getting sober in the final 15 minutes.  Emotionally unnecessary in 2020."
The Way Back,83,84,audience,Affleck did a nice job in this movie.  I think that most people will have an emotional connection to this movie relating to the different characters and situations.
The Way Back,83,84,audience,The Way Back succeeds thanks to Ben Affleck's career-best performance.
The Way Back,83,84,audience,Ben Affleck puts on a very credible and moving performance.  This is not some trite sports story where you know the good guys will win the big game.  It is a great story of redemption.
The Way Back,83,84,audience,"As redemption-through-sports movies go, this by-the-numbers basketball melodrama is about as predictable and cliched as they come. This earnestly solemn saga of a baggage-laden, alcoholic former high school basketball star seeking to turn his life around is so rote that virtually any viewer could have penned its formulaic script. In fact, were it not for the surprisingly strong Critics Choice Award-nominated performance of protagonist Ben Affleck, director Gavin O'Connor's latest would be otherwise virtually forgettable. There are many far better movies about sports underdogs, miraculous comebacks and the plight of addiction out there that would make superior viewing choices; all one needs to do is pick one."
The Way Back,83,84,critic,"
The Way Back is less a sports movie and more a character study of an alcoholic. And as such, it is only so compelling.

To borrow a sports cliché, Ben Affleck gives 110 per cent in The Way Back, an earnest but effective character study that doubles as an inspirational basketball drama.

Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,audience,I had high hopes but it didn’t hold up.
Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,audience,"Lucy Hale's second collaboration with Blumhouse is about as much of a stinker as 2018's TRUTH OR DARE. Based on the TV show of the same name, this movie is about a group of 5 people who win a contest and are taken to said island to live out a fantasy. The only rules are each person is allowed only one fantasy and they have to see it through until the end, no matter what. Very early on each contestant is living out his/her fantasy and the story becomes very messy very quickly, trying to juggle 4 storylines at once (4 fantasies instead of 5 as a pair of brothers share 1 fantasy together). As such, plot holes quickly begin to develop, storylines about the island as well as characters introduced are never fully explained, leaving the viewing asking more questions than answers given. Not to mention the dreaded PG-13 rating, which you know will water down any language or violence, both of which this films suffers from a lack of as well. Blumhouse is usually hit-or-miss and this film is most certainly in the latter."

The plot was all over the place and most of the characters made really dumb decisions. At the end of the movie they try to execute a crazy plot twist but it was very shoehorned in. Please don't watch this movie if you want to watch a good Horror/Thriller."
Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,audience,"So much good, so many plot twist I will watch more ten times.
Madu eu te Amo!"
Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,audience,This movie could have been a pretty sweet movie but such a shame that it was so poorly executed.  It really stops making sense towards the end and even contradicts itself. Do not wasre your time on this mess.
Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,audience,"I've postponed watching this film a very long time. As a fan of Lucy Hale, I was curious to see this one even with all these reviews. I didn't know anything going in... But Blumhouse has made better films so ""why not""?

For starters. The film jumps right in, love it. What you see is what you get. But the writers didn't understand the script they'd written when it was finished. I'd figured out mid-second act that ""one of them wanted a fantasy do-over because of that guy who got burned. Nick"" before the story explained that. But they went full ""everything is not what it seems."" because they had decided, that what we'd see isn't what we were getting. The problem by doing a plot twist in your third act (and as a screenwriter, I can tell. Believe me.) Is... That you have to check the script from front to back, again and again... With a fine tooth comb. It's very, very clear that the writers failed that task and were going for a rushed ending.

I get that you want to pay hommage to a TV Show from years ago because you've ""borrowed"" the title for your film. But if that's your main goal... Write the story structure and twist as effectively to fit that goal. They clearly knew what Blumhouse thing they've wanted to do with it... But they'd gotten their hairs crossed by wanting to do both. At a point you've gotta decide as a writer... ""Which darling am I going to have to kill""? But they wanted to have their cake and eat it too."

Despite its potential, Fantasy Island's shoddy script can't save it from being one of Blumhouse's more notable blunders. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,critic,"
Blumhouse's Fantasy Island is like a giant tangled, rotting ball of yarn that keeps gathering dustballs of bad ideas on top of more bad ideas. You can try to untangle it to sort it all out, but it's not worth it, and it's best to avoid it altogether.
 "
Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,critic,"
It's hard to walk away from Fantasy Island feeling like this idea could have been utilized better. Perhaps, there's a movie where you can parse both compelling scares and narrative that really depicts the dangers of changing the past.

If you remember the Fantasy Island television show, you should watch the film at least once if for nothing more than nostalgia's sake.
 "
Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,critic,"
'Fantasy Island' is admittedly nothing to dream about, but it's a hell of a lot of fun. If you can prepare yourself for something that feels as if it came out 20 years ago, then you'll have a solid time with it.
 "
Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,critic,"
Look, this remake of the '70s TV show about - you guessed it - a Fantasy Island, where your dreams come back to haunt you, is horrible.
 "
Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,critic,"
There's a good movie in here somewhere, and the unrated cut amped it up a bit, but the overall payoff is kinda laughable.
 "

Just about everything in the movie falls flat with stock characters and limp storyline.

'Fantasy Island' is worse than 'Cats.'

Blumhouse's Fantasy Island,7,48,critic,"
The big-budget decorum doesn't do much to outrun the silliness, though, and you have to hand it to everyone involved for not making this some grim, gritty take. FANTASY ISLAND is also goofy as hell, which is arguably the only thing it has going for it.

Horse Girl,70,48,audience,It was so boring. Unusual movies are usually at least somewhat interesting but this was so boring.
Horse Girl,70,48,audience,"It is a fairly unusual viewing experience but if you like twists on reality, this is for you."
Horse Girl,70,48,audience,"Just when you think you have the right hypothesis, pulls you towards a different conclusion"
Horse Girl,70,48,audience,"This is one of those rare times that I agree with the critics over the audience. That said, you do need to be in the right frame of mind to watch such a mind bender. Is it a comedy or a drama? Yes. Is it sci-fi or reality? Also yes! I love stories with plausible multiple endings and this one can fit perfectly into whichever ending you choose. The acting, directing and production values are outstanding as is the story (stories?). Personally, I see a way that both can be true. Give this one a watch, keep an open mind and enjoy!"
Horse Girl,70,48,audience,psychedelic and poetic
Horse Girl,70,48,audience,"Phenomenal acting, deep messages, and critical thought. I loved it."
Horse Girl,70,48,audience,"This movie is a runaway train and I kinda liked it.  Sarah is magoo, works at a fabric store and has no life 'cause she's so awkward.  But then, when the delusions start to set it, the ride starts to go off the tracks into a bizarre land of strange ideations that are so strange you can't stop watching."
Horse Girl,70,48,audience,"Although Horse Girl is clearly structurally problematic and not as sophisticated in execution as its premise demanded, the movie mostly works as it is effective in all of its suspenseful and also tragic moments. The movie wouldn't have worked nearly as much had it not been for Alison Brie's truly remarkable and heartbreaking performance."
Horse Girl,70,48,audience,Well that was weird This Drama is an interesting watch but it's not for everyone
Horse Girl,70,48,audience,Super weird. I wish they would have gone a different way with it.
Horse Girl,70,48,critic,"
Amongst the metaphor and pathos, it's Brie's performance that stands out.
 "
Horse Girl,70,48,critic,"
Everything produced by the Duplass Brothers is hollow and superficial and cutesy. Their examinations of the bourgeoisie lack depth and flatter their audience...
 "
Horse Girl,70,48,critic,"
This movie is definitely not about horses. If you want to watch a conspiracy-theory movie with sci-fi gimmicks that have been done much better in other films, then feel free to waste about 104 minutes of your time to watch Horse Girl.

By the end, viewers have whiplash and a distinct sensation that the script needed several more drafts, but they aren't bored.

Horse Girl unfolds like a fever dream, appropriately. A twisting narrative built upon strong performances. The end is far from satisfying, but that's part of its charm.
 "
Horse Girl,70,48,critic,"
Brie's performance is powerful and the film's editing does a superb job of mixing Sarah's obscured perception with reality, succeeding in offering an unsettling look into the mind of someone who suffers from a severe mental illness.

The conclusion is meaningfully painful and actually felt like an invitation to revisit the film, a privilege afforded to streaming flicks that is too rarely exploited.

An incongruous, engaging ride, Horse Girl doesn't hit all the marks, and some audiences will become deterred, but Brie's tour de force performance is truly the base and it's one worth jumping off from.

Mental illness as the engine for a thriller is a cultural conceit whose days are numbered, but, as a last gasp, there's no denying this entry is compelling and evocative.

Young woman battles mental illness; sex/nudity, language.
 "

The second half of ""Horse Girl"" loses rhythm and tension, finding the writing irritatingly light on detail when it comes time to submerge the lead character in complete insanity.
 "
Horse Girl,70,48,critic,"
Brie is rawly convincing as a troubled woman for whom the sides of reality have become too slippery, transformed into the heroine of a private sci-fi melodrama.

Horse Girl takes a while for its story to get going, but once it gets into gear, it excels in its beautifully bizarre and thought-provoking themes.

Inherit the Viper,45,49,audience,I found the acting was really good quality in this film. However the story line was boring and I don't know why they bothered to make this film.
Inherit the Viper,45,49,audience, Movie had the makings of an excellent series....the character development was too stunted by time to create much of an effect
Inherit the Viper,45,49,audience,Nothing you have not seen before.Hartnett and co. do a creditable job.One time watch.
Inherit the Viper,45,49,audience,"The only redeeming value was despite all odds stacked against is Josh Harnett. He does exceptionally well to carry an otherwise formulaic, empty, mean spirited film, relying on the gravity of the subject matter to carry an otherwise poorly executed and poorly done 85 minutes you will never get back."
Inherit the Viper,45,49,audience,"I. The Viper is very well written and full of twists that I never saw coming. The movie discusses topics of choice decisions and the struggle to find working solutions to save a family in the midst of breakdown, and the consequences that follow these decisions unravel till the very last scene. I felt very connected to the characters."
Inherit the Viper,45,49,audience,"It's not for everyone, but it will resonate with a lot of people for different reasons.  The movie has a lot to offer, and it gets better as it goes on.  The critics mainly seem to be complaining that they wanted more of it... more depth, more time to the characters, etc., and I agree.  This should have been a series, not packed into a 90-min episode."
Inherit the Viper,45,49,audience,I was surprised to see that critiques failed to appreciate this Gem of a movie. I believe the acting to have been a perfect fit to this backdrop of a town that displays a drug use problem. Within this short run time you aren't meant to nor need to attach yourself to any one character to feel the circumstances of all parties involved and to understand the escalation of each decision leading to the climax.
Inherit the Viper,45,49,audience,"Dark, visually captivating, ""Inherit the viper"" portrays the early stages of the opioids epidemic in the US in a way the audience, especially those living in the Appalachia, can relate to, through a good balance of storytelling and reality, tension, great performances and atmosphere. No need for shaky, effect loaded action scenes. Just a thrilling story of family and crime."
Inherit the Viper,45,49,audience,"This was a dark and intense look at the opioid epidemic and how it can infect a community. The movie itself was open-ended and left you wishing for more on the Connellys. Josh Hartnett gave a really strong performance as a guy conflicted by his duties toward his family and his conscience.
Overall it felt like real life."
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Josh Hartnett reminds us why he was once of the most in-demand actors of our times, with a multi-faceted, complex and somewhat appropriately fraught turn. Atmospheric and well-performed
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
A competent debut for a new filmmaker and a reminder how good a clearly forgotten actor still is? That's not so bad for a movie with this crummy a title.

Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Never had much of a sting.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"

 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
I like where this film is set and what it's about.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Despite a running time of only 85 minutes, it feels like days of mean-spirited self-indulgence.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Any attempt to explore the impact of the opioid epidemic is buried beneath clichés and contrivances in this mildly taut drama about a crime-ridden family legacy.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Evocatively moody atmosphere, a timely subject, and a fine performance by Josh Hartnett cannot help Inherit the Viper overcome its clunky dialogue and formulaic storyline.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Inherit The Viper had the potential to be an exciting thriller with dramatic family elements. Instead, its characters fall flat as if the actors were not allowed or unwilling to flesh out their characters more.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Both [Josh Hartnett and Bruce Dern] are good enough here with material that ultimately does not quite make the grade to make you wish that you could seem them again soon in something more worthy of their talents.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Inherit the Viper﻿ is a standard crime film that is somewhat bolstered by the family dynamic at its center and some solid performances.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
The darker heart of the film ... is in its examination of the addictive qualities of power.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
This is a film that calls attention to a struggling region's problems in a general way, rather than telling in detail the true stories of the people who keep hanging on there.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Unfortunately, for all its admirable intentions and the terrific performances by its talented ensemble, Inherit the Viper fails to have any genuine impact.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
""Inherit the Viper"" is at its best when keyed into the disposability of human lives, but most of the film can hardly be bothered to care about the ones it chooses to follow.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
A terse, controlled thriller about how the family ties that bind - love, loyalty, survival - are tested by criminality and amorality, which here aren't always analogous.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
""Inherit the Viper"" isn't surprising, but it's accomplished, getting into the muck of criminal activity without losing focus on the human price of such survival instincts.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Gritty, intense and atmospheric, but also shallow, pedestrian and monotonous. It's a dull, forgettable B-movie.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
A run of the mill crime drama that does the genre well and also features Josh Hartnett.
 "
Inherit the Viper,45,49,critic,"
Anthony Jerjen's directorial debut shines a light on the opioid epidemic, honing on not only how it breaks down a community, but even the most loyal and protective of families

Togo,92,95,audience,I sobbed. what an amazing story.
Togo,92,95,audience,"I really like this movie, based on true events, it makes me love even more to my lovely dog"
Togo,92,95,audience,"I was not expecting to like this movie as much as I did.  It blew my mind that Togo was the real ""hero dog"" not Balto.  I couldn't stop talking about this movie for days after I watched it."
Togo,92,95,audience,A great story telling the true story of a widely published even from 1925. Togo was the incredible dog who made the incredible trip to save Nome. While Balto has stolen the limelight (no fault of or disrespect to him) Togo was truly exceptional!
Togo,92,95,audience,"A memorable, heroic dog."
Togo,92,95,audience,"If you've ever been lucky enough to have a truly amazing animal in your life this movie is meant for you.
I feel truly sorry for the viewers who rated it poorly as they simply could not relate."
Togo,92,95,audience,"Absolutely brilliant!
I never really new the whole story behind the 1925 serum run to Nome. Like most of us, I told that Balto was the lead dog in the run, and even though I heard once or twice, people mentioning Togo I didn't know why. Now I do! What a hero!"
Togo,92,95,audience,"A wonderfully unique story, a brilliant cast, fantastically produced. Touching and tense, cute, heartbreaking and at times funny. If you liked the animated film Balto, I'm confident you will love this more serious live-action version of the same story, which - though dramatised at times - also sheds light on the true story of the serum run of 1925 and the men and dogs involved. All of this done with respect for the people involved, the audience, and of course, the dogs. 10/10 would recommend."

The film's particular breed of old-school Disneyosity - a sweetly earnest, action-filled tale of the bond between man and beast - feels like an ideal tonic.

Togo is in a slightly more sombre register than Call Of The Wild but delivers similar sturdy pleasures; exciting dog-in-peril action and striking landscapes, all anchored by Dafoe's grounded performance.

While this true story of a husky tested to his limits in 1925 Alaska does push some of the same emotional buttons, it never quite packs the same punch.

At a startling and completely unnecessary 114 minutes, every scene of Togo drags.
 "
Togo,92,95,critic,"
Willem Dafoe and his Husky Togo's life-or-death journey is a mesmerizing nail-biter. Additional roles by Zahn McClarnon and Michael Greyeyes add depth to the story, but it's still a non-Native guy's story in Native Alaska

The Irishman,95,86,audience,"The fact we finally got a film with Pacino, De Niro & Pesci is just so great. Three legends still at the top of the game.

The Irishman was 100% worth the hype although not as good as past mafia classics."
The Irishman,95,86,audience,"Tentei assistir umas 3 vezes e dormi todas. O ponto forte é o elenco. Mas a fluidez da história é muito arrastada e o filme é longo demais, cansativo."
The Irishman,95,86,audience,"A fascinating watch - totally worth the 209 minute run time.

There's so much to like about 'The Irishman'. From the top class performances, the ace cinematography, the excellent music and, most importantly, the captivating plot. I enjoyed this more than (the great) 'Goodfellas', which is my only previous experience of a Martin Scorsese film.

Robert De Niro is always a fantastic watch and here he is no different, I absolutely loved every scene of him as Frank. Al Pacino (Jimmy) and Joe Pesci (Russell) are also superb, Pacino particularly. Away from those three, you also have Ray Romano, Bobby Cannavale, Stephen Graham and Harvey Keitel involved. Awesome cast.

No idea how true to life it is, all I care is if it delivers a fantastic film - and it undoubtedly does. I felt entertained for every second. The de-aging effects are cool to see, also. I understand why some may fault this. Me? Loved it!"
The Irishman,95,86,audience,"I never thought I'd see Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, and Martin Scorsese work on a film together, but here we finally are! Pacino and De Niro are back on their game and Pesci, coerced out of retirement, puts together an as equally strong performance. Many Scorsese alum are seen throughout and even the de-aging technology was top notch and actually aided the film, rather than take away from it. My only 2 gripes with the film were the lack of a solid Scorsese soundtrack that we've come to expect from him and the runtime. I did enjoy the film thoroughly, but even at 3 1/2 hours, it was rather long."
The Irishman,95,86,audience,"It was a very slow and long movie. There wasn't really a moment suprème, plot. It was just an old man who sometimes kills people. Kinda boring"
The Irishman,95,86,audience,"Packed with talent both in front of and behind the camera. It's also impressive how they manage to age and de-age the characters to tell a story spanning such a long time. The characters aren't that interesting though nor is the plot. This take on a more realistic life of a gangster is an interesting idea on paper, but it lacks direction and while there are plenty of good small parts it does not amount to anything all that meaningful. The long runtime makes sense for the story that is being told but it ultimately did more harm than good."
The Irishman,95,86,audience,This is my favorite Martin Scorsese film and it's epic and masterpiece as well.
The Irishman,95,86,audience,"Excellent gangster movie as only can be made in the US. It is in the zip code of, Goodfellas, The Departed, and almost, but not quite, the Godfather. (I mean, what is in that league) Well supported by the usual, and excellent, crew of proper villains. Almost three hours long and just barley not long enough. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
The Irishman,95,86,audience,the theme of regret resonates well with me but i would like to see more diversity

The Irishman is not only one of Martin Scorsese's best films (which is saying a lot), but also a tribute to all the crime movies in which its director has specialized (contributing masterpieces to this genre). [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
While perhaps a step below Scorsese's other classic films, mostly because of its length, The Irishman shows that the master filmmaker still knows how to deliver a crackerjack story.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
Scorsese has never been drawn to presenting actual history. ... The director has done little to add to the public's knowledge about Jimmy Hoffa or the degeneration of the American labor movement.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
The holy trinity, De Niro, Pesci and Pacino, hand in late career work that feels like the culmination of a lifetime of character studies.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
The Irishman looks inwards and acts as a sorrowful dismantling of one's own myth-making.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
Here is the most unpopular opinion of the year: The Irishman is too long, too contrived and, generally, too much Martin Scorsese trying to outdo himself.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
In a very real sense, Martin Scorsese is fighting against his own mythic legacy. In another way, of course, his return to the form in which he made some of the more compelling American cinema of the last five decades is a perfectly fitting closing coda.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
Scorsese makes movies that Scorsese likes, damned be anyone who doesn't care much for them. All of his stylistic touches are here, but there's a certain hollowness to the whole affair that's admirable even if not likeable.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
Little more than an excuse to get the band back together.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
Perhaps Martin Scorsese's most ambitious work, this biopic of reputed union leader and mob hitman Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) has a narrative sweep that immediately grabs the viewer and refuses to let them go.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
Well, objectively, the film is kind of boring.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
I saw The Irishman in a huge theater on a giant screen, and I did not want to get up, didn't want it to end, and could have watched another hour of it if there was one.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
A film that seems like typical Scorsese until it doesn't seem like typical Scorsese anymore.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
Reiterating my love of Scorsese, it's his ability to experiment that makes him a compelling director. Every film he directs is worth the time, and The Irishman lives up to that billing.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
The Irishman is Scorsese working with what he knows best to express a new level of maturity, ruminating on the significance of legacy and what it means to live with the decisions that you have made along the way.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
A titanic, towering crime drama with a tangled narrative web to fit its epic runtime. It's pure cinema as only a maestro like Scorsese can deliver.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
It's an amazing film that caps off a stunning career in film that spans over 50 years.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
The great performances and incredible filmmaking make this fictionalized tale of Frank Sheeran a story to end the decade, one that has seen many changes within the film industry - and hopefully introducing a new era of Martin Scorsese.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
Zaillian follows Scorsese; Scorsese follows himself; they both follow Brandt, whose end goal is nothing if not ephemeral. The disconnect shouldn't work, but here it's the crux.
 "
The Irishman,95,86,critic,"
A 3 1/2 hour epic that is in many ways the antithesis of ""Goodfellas,"" featuring many of Scorsese's auteur signatures but presented in a quiet, mournful tone asking if the gangster life was really worth it.
 "
Midway,41,92,audience,"Much better than the 1976 version. The movie portrays the courage of soldiers and their human side. Great special effects, especially the dive bombing sequences. A great balance between action scenes and story telling."

Cast stellare che ricopre tutti gli ruoli dei veri protagonisti; anche se alcuni sono sviluppati in maniera un po' dozzinale per fare spazio a scene spettacolari di combattimento.
Azione in abbondanza senza troppe pretese."
Midway,41,92,audience,Very entertaining and with great graphics. This movie reminds you of the history we sometimes forget. It also gives young audiences an idea of what happened in Midway. The cinematography of the film and the way that is shot gives you a more feel for what is happening.
Midway,41,92,audience,"The Midway probably is one of the most intense battle in the history, but this one failed to recapture the moments."
Midway,41,92,audience,"If you're here for a top-tier WW2 film...this isn't your movie. However, if you're here for a wildly entertaining and over-the-top patriotic movie celebrating American exceptionalism with some awesome action scenes...hop along for the ride."
Midway,41,92,audience,Cheesy as hell but rip roaring fun anyway.
Midway,41,92,audience,"Completely humorless movie featuring two dimensional characters, wooden dialog and historical inaccuracies. There are better movies about the war in the Pacific."
Midway,41,92,audience,"Midway is a cool take on the Battle of Midway. I do enjoy the action sequences, the acting, the direction and the historical accuracy. But I felt that the main problem was the editing and the story. At least it was better than the 1976 version. Overall, Midway won the battle with little damages."
Midway,41,92,audience,"It seemed as if the cast was trying so hard on their terrible accents that their mouth movements were very unnatural. The main guys accent was horrible. They seemed to be trying for a 40's feel movie with the gum chewing an Jersey/Brooklyn attitude. Dennis Quaid with his fake nose trying to sound like Mickey from Rocky. It actually boring. I think he was a Jonus brother not sure, he talked like he had marbles in his mouth."
Midway,41,92,audience,"A solid, exciting movie.  Drawing emotion, and yet being quite informative and exciting."
Midway,41,92,critic,"
Evaluating all its edges, Midway has a positive balance. It walks with ease between two antipodes that seem antagonistic: war and spectacle. Emmerich manages to recreate a critical moment in the history of United States [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
Midway's biggest sins are how it both failed to translate this to the screen effectively, and in so doing, leaving us longing for Michael Bay.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
Despite so many characters - including a wealth of Japanese officers - there's no emotional connection to any of the cookie-cutter personas.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
It's the reverence and respect that's paid to these warriors that is a surprise, marking a new sense of maturity to Emmerich's work.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
It is a real shame that Midway does not succeed as it certainly promises a lot with its talented cast and its well-worn story. Instead, the film just crashes and burns; failing to meet its lofty goals halfway.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
It might make a worthy Veterans Day watch if you bring your veteran grandparent or war-buff parent. You'll remember the experience with your loved ones more than the actual movie.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
World War II turns into, as Scorsese would have called it, a 'theme-park ride' in Midway.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
An over-long, dated, old-fashioned war drama, with an overkill of digital effects and tedium.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
Just because a movie is thoroughly watchable doesn't mean it's particularly good.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
I can see that he really wanted to pull off a good old-fashioned World War II movie that feels earnest and straight to the point. It's just that Emmerich is never known as a credible storyteller.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
Emmerich's greatest work to date... is a spectacular combination of true historical story, eye-popping visual effects and massively scaled action sequences, and gripping human drama.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
This incarnation does have Woody Harrelson, Patrick Wilson and Luke Evans trying their best to transcend the cliché trappings of Wes Tooke's lousy screenplay.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
Midway is chock full of talented actors who make up an ensemble cast that is to be envied.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
Effects heavy and drama-lite.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
Midway is a bloated, confusing, cliché-laden World War II movie that isn't worthy of the actual events it is trying to recreate.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
This is a film free from dramatic nuance and irony; it's about as subtle as the attack on Pearl Harbor. But (dialogue aside) it's a very good history lesson in movie form.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
A weird mix of the historically accurate and the unforgivably fake.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
Why remake Midway anyway? Surely we've seen all this before, and while the ads naturally claim that this is the ""untold story"" of these events, we've in fact been told about this, and told, and told, and told...
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
The ten torrid minutes spent recreating the Pearl Harbor assault early in the picture set a high bar for its subsequent battle scenes, and each rises to the occasion without overdoing it.
 "
Midway,41,92,critic,"
Emmerich's bombastic eye-candy may indeed be the perfect foil for Tooke's mechanical script-it's almost admirable how the duo have achieved peak-brain-dead-commercial-crap.

Holiday Hell,20,,audience,Oof that was hard to watch
Holiday Hell,20,,audience,"Could have skipped the first of the four stories entirely; seemed like it was from a whole different filmmaker. Casting, acting, dialogue not great. The other 3 stories were good. The second story was good. Lisa Coronado is alway fantastic. The little boy was really good too. The 3rd one, the actor that played  Santa was great! The 4th story McKenna Ralston is a standout, very believable.  Meagan Karimi-Naser stellar throughout. Loved her in Dead West too!
Would have rated 4 stars, but almost didn't continue to watch after a few minutes through the first story, but really enjoyed the filmmakers first two movie releases and kept the faith. Glad I did!"
Holiday Hell,20,,critic,"
Holiday Hell really doesn't do enough to take advantage of its premise with stories that fail to lean in hard enough on the theme.
 "
Holiday Hell,20,,critic,"
Holiday Hell does not always overcome its influences and often struggles to define its own voice within the milieu it is exploring. Nevertheless, this series of horror anecdotes was clearly made by a group of passionate people who were having fun...
 "
Holiday Hell,20,,critic,"
Holiday Hell is a fun, if fleeting, deviation from the traditional Christmas movie with suitably hammy performances and thrills.
 "
Holiday Hell,20,,critic,"
A ""holiday horror"" anthology that lacks any ""holiday"" or ""horror"" appeal.

The True Don Quixote,,91,audience,Really well acted by all the players. Tim Blake Nelson is outstanding. Very endearing and funny movie.
The True Don Quixote,,91,audience,"Eccentric and hilarious while touching on heavier themes like mental illness, The True Don Quixote puts a modern spin on a classic story that will leave viewers warmed and pensive. Recommended for those who enjoy witty, ironic dialogue and the charms of discovering the extraordinary within the ordinary. (think Scott Pilgrim vs the World, Little Miss Sunshine)"
The True Don Quixote,,91,audience,"This movie is a whimsical rendition of the famous novel ""Don Quixote"". Set in present-day Louisiana this movie follows the journey of a man who is convinced he is a knight and hero from the 16th century. Grab your family or your friends and be prepared to laugh your heads off at this amusing and beautifully made movie!"
The True Don Quixote,,91,audience,The True Don Quixote is a quirky and entertaining adaptation of most influential work of literature from the Spanish Golden Age and the entire Spanish literary canon.
The True Don Quixote,,91,audience,"A warm story filled with lovable characters, TTDQ offers a refreshing spin on a 400 year old story. The dynamic between Sancho and Don is brought alive by the hilarity of Batalon and Nelson."
The True Don Quixote,,91,audience,"This reinvigorating take on the international classic, Don Quixote, puts a unique spin by scaling down an epic to fit into small-town rural Louisiana. By making such a gargantuan tale into something that makes the ordinary extraordinary, one can only hope that this movie serves as an inspiration for others to find their inner folk hero and find the adventure in everyday life."
The True Don Quixote,,91,audience,"This was such an adorable, heartwarming film--and really shines a light on mental illness.  I highly recommend watching this to get in good laughs and a lot of smiles!"
The True Don Quixote,,91,critic,"
A deftly directed, emotionally resonant update of Cervantes' tale. Most importantly, it never loses grip of the comedy and humanity that makes it all so magical to begin with.
 "
The True Don Quixote,,91,critic,"
The True Don Quixote is an offbeat and entertaining spin on the famous story, bolstered by a dedicated Tim Blake Nelson performance.
 "
The True Don Quixote,,91,critic,"
In its own way, Poche's adaptation goes for the gut by letting Tim Blake Nelson hit at the soul of what it all means now.

Running With the Devil,24,39,audience,"We always watch movies because it's just our ""thang"" and so many are notoriously bad.  This was a surprise, he didn't act at all like usual, not the same mannerisms or even voice pitch.  It was a surprisingly good movie."
Running With the Devil,24,39,audience,"Cage is near the top of the coke chain and has to take care of some shipment issues that Fishburne has gotten his hands into.  Leslie Bibb is fed up, running around and nobody getting arrested..."
Running With the Devil,24,39,audience,What a waste of time!  Just plain terrible.
Running With the Devil,24,39,audience,"Enjoyed this film quite a bit. Twisting and interesting, brings drug trade back into conversation where it should be."
Running With the Devil,24,39,audience,"The director/writer is trying something interesting with this dive into ""classic"" drug running material (and honestly his life story is more interesting than what we are seeing - Navy Seal, to Narcotics Officer, To Movie Director/Writer).  BUT...large pieces of the narrative or either missing or just skipped leaving a confusing mess that ends with a scene in which one character kills another for no reason ever shown in the film (and where the same character has a very good reason to kill a different character).  Subtitles are really wonky in this (and this is a common complaint) For those that care, Cage is playing it normal in this one.  2 out of 5 stars"
Running With the Devil,24,39,audience,"Sort of a Traffic wannabe, Running with the Devil is a mediocre and underwhelming crime drama.  When a shipment of tainted cocaine kills several people, drawing the attention of the DEA, the head of the operation sends a specialist to follow the next shipment to find out who's been tampering with it and to ensure that nothing goes wrong.  Featuring Nicolas Cage, Laurence Fishburne, Leslie Bibb, and Barry Pepper, the cast is pretty strong; however, their performances are rather weak.  And the script isn't that much better; there's no real character development and most of them don't even have names.  The plot too is paper thin, requiring the audience to fill-in some of the missing pieces as to why and how things happen.  Running with the Devil is problematic, yet it still delivers a bit of suspense and a few thrillers."
Running With the Devil,24,39,audience,"“Traffic”-light, but in the end it’s a movie without an identity. All the characters have “names” out of a Tarantino rip-off (The Cook, The Man, The Boss, Agent in Charge), but the film lacks any swagger. It plays it straight as a tale about moving drugs across the border. It casts Nic Cage (he’s “The Cook”), but gives him nothing to do. One bright spot is Laurence Fishburne as a degenerate dealer (he’s “The Man”)."
Running With the Devil,24,39,audience,"Don't pay attention to the low reviews. The movie has everything for a male to see drugs, pretty ladies and lots of violence. Satisfying conclusion. I may not pay for it , but with Hulu subscription it's worth the watch."
Running With the Devil,24,39,audience,"Wow, I guess Laurence Fishburne went bankrupt."
Running With the Devil,24,39,audience,It seems every actor was trying a little too hard on this movie...
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
There's a lot going on in Running With the Devil, but also somehow absolutely nothing at all. It jumbles together too many storylines, drug movie clichés, flat characters, and an epic cast of B-movie all stars.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
If you want to see a film about how the Columbian drug trade process works, then this movie is for you. If you like films like Sicario or Traffic, this may be right up your alley...
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
As long as the movie sticks with Fishburne it's a blast. Unfortunately, Cabell has bigger ambitions.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
Running With the Devil is a dull, disjointed affair that unfortunately wastes the talents of its high-profile ensemble cast.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
Jason Cabell's Running With The Devil might not be perfect, but at least it attempts to do something new with the oft-told tale of drugs moving across the Mexico/US border.
 "

""It's Nic Cage. How bad could it be?""
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
Ho-hum. Running with the Devil is yet another generic drug trade thriller that defies coherence, embraces clichés, and wastes the time and talent of Nicolas Cage.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
The result is a misfire, but at least it's a rather convincing one.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
This crime procedural is consistently fascinating as it charts the minutiae of the drug business -- but it also tries to be a bit too clever and neglects the characters in the process.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
Another ho hum movie that follows Nicolas Cage's career down the rabbit hole.

It is less ""Breaking Bad"" than it is merely bad.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
Despite featuring gunplay, nudity, illicit drugs and a setting that crosses two continents, Running With the Devil feels more like a leisurely, chemically enhanced stroll.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
Running With the Devil stumbles as it laboriously works its way through the familiar piles of white-powder crime.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
... overflows with testosterone-fueled macho posturing without offering any substantially fresh insight into the contemporary drug trade.

Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
There are human beings involved in the process ... It would be a stretch to call them characters.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
What might in other hands have played as a tragedy is lent further emotional distance by the fact that there are almost no innocent victims here.

Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
It almost doesn't matter that it doesn't make a lick of sense.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
The latest in Nicolas Cage's apparently inexhaustible supply of B-movie potboilers... Nameless people move around a lot in 'Running With the Devil,' but the end result is drearily aimless.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
Recycled from many other - better- drug running dramas.
 "
Running With the Devil,24,39,critic,"
A tiresome parade of gory and sexist cliches that are, frankly, insulting to a cast that includes Laurence Fishburne, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Leslie Bibb and Clifton Collins Jr.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,audience,"So this movie, had me terrified because John Travolta stalked someone the whole entire movie, um I do not know what to think at all. I am disturbed and I do not recommend watching it unless you want night mares."
The Fanatic,16,29,audience,The story is more out there than most and John Travolta is absolutely nuts! He's just so crazy it kept me locked in. Not sure if he's autistic or just plain re:tarded under IQ like Forrest Gump but they do a good job in creating the part of the fanatic .
The Fanatic,16,29,audience,"Travolta tries waaaaay too hard to ""be on the spectrum"". He makes Sheldon Cooper seem like a pretty normal dude. But as an autistic person, I must say he does the rocking back and forwards pretty decently."
The Fanatic,16,29,audience,"Very good movie. Both Travolta and Sawa give it their all, and the film gives a good amount of humor and tension."
The Fanatic,16,29,audience,"This movie is not bad, it is spectacularly bad. Fred Durst sucks at every aspect of film making. Story, pacing, dialogue and the directing of actors are all abysmal. Every actor in this movie makes Paul Walker look like Sir Laurence Olivier.

Travolta's performance is amongst the worst I have seen from any professional actor. He tries, but it's just terrible. Durst's directing advice must have been something like ""OK, you're Rainman, but also a borderline psychopath.""

His character is obviously deeply troubled and mentally ill, but the few acquaintances he has apparently don't notice and just spur on his behaviour which leads to the inevitable.

Durst even puts in a plug for Limp Bizkit. A father is driving his 10 year old kid and is like ""Hey, do you like Limp Bizkit? They're awesome!"" and then cranks a song up on the car stereo 🙄

I give it 1/7, as no movie really deserves a 0 because a lot of decent people work hard on them. That being said though, I highly recommend this movie. It is pretty much a modern day The Room with higher production values. If you're looking for something unchallenging and unintentionally comedic, this is the movie for you."
The Fanatic,16,29,audience,Nothing original about this slow fan who takes things too far cliche film.
The Fanatic,16,29,audience,Its funny in so many ways that I can't explain. John Travolta and Devin Sawa both are very fun in this film. Its in the list of Good Bad Movies. you won't like it but you will have fun with it regardless. 
The Fanatic,16,29,audience,"A guilty pleasure. I'd write more but I gotta poop. 

Poppycock!"
The Fanatic,16,29,audience,Travolta's performance was atrocious and so was fred durst as a director for this movie

Travolta makes specific acting choices to play a character that he said is on the spectrum, including rocking back and forth and rarely making eye contact.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
A factory of unintentional laughter. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
I like [Durst's] approach to this new film, an 88-minute psychological thriller that might be compared with Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy

The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
An unpleasant watch any way you slice it.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
A car crash of a movie that, despite its hammy acting and over-the-top story, will have you unable to avert your eyes. It might be time for John Travolta to reconnect with Tarantino again.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
So now we know what a film directed by Fred Durst and starring John Travolta looks like. For the better: it is competently put together, and features a sturdy supporting cast.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
he thing that makes this film work as frighteningly well as it does is Travolta's all-in performance and Durst's surprisingly thoughtful script and precision direction, which looks at fandom through a very jaundiced lens.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
It is poorly handled by director Fred Durst... however, with a clumsy voice over, which distracts from the story rather than enchanting it and some time-lapse drawings that don't seem to add anything to the unfolding narrative.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
This movie has no stance at all. It hates everyone - not the least of which are people with autism...it's a wretched, offensive pile of junk.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
If you judged acting by volume alone, Travolta would win every Oscar for his performance.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
What does it say when something as [bad] as The Fanatic turns out to be only the eighth worst movie of Travolta's perpetually tarnished and only occasionally elevated career?

You just realize that they can't act, and I do feel sorry for them...

The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
It starts with the best intentions, but then people really start getting reckless...there is not one shred of logic or realism in this world...
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
An awkward entry in the growing genre of Travoltasploitation.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
This movie is neither good enough to be genuinely watchable, nor bad enough to be entertaining ironically.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
The Fanatic is a drastic look at the dangers of fan culture, idolisation and obsession.
 "
The Fanatic,16,29,critic,"
A fascinating yet problematic exploration of fame, celebrity and fandom, that loses its grip on reality when exploitative violence becomes the films motivation.

47 Meters Down: Uncaged,45,68,audience,"This absolutely thrilling horror is a real must see! I was only going to watch half one day and the rest the next day, but I literally couldn't stop watching! I think that this movie is great as almost all ages can watch it over maybe 9, so I really recommend 👍Also, I am not really such a gruesome horror type of person, but this was done in a way that I felt really scared and excited but it wasn't so terrifying that I had nightmares all through the night, so I recommend even for those like me, who don't really like gruesome movies. However, some scenes may be quite gruesome, so don't expect a calm blood free watch! Anyway, absolutely RECOMMENDED for all over 9/10 years of age.Enjoy!"
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,45,68,audience,"First, 46 seconds of 47 meters down was the best part of the movie 11/10, everything else was terrible, the 47th second was great too nothing else though. (Claire 1)"

The Characters had really no purpose why did they call it 47 meters down sequel"
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,45,68,audience,"A great shark film with a new twist. Some minor plot holes, but overall really good. Storyline is very sweet and endearing, but the fathers death was pointless. Would have been better if he sacrificed himself to save his daughters. Instead we get a remake of Samuel L. Jacksons' death scene in deep blue sea."
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,45,68,audience,"Officially (see my diary for details) the worst movie I've ever seen.  Thankfully; I saw it at home; on my couch.  That eased a bit of the pain; but boy howdee -- it still hurts.  

When I come to write a 1/2 star review on a movie that I saw for free (or maybe for $5.99; I can't remember) then you best believe....this movie was bad.  

Please - don't see it."
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,45,68,audience,Fairly good for the genre. But stupidly unbelievable for the basic human. The ending was the worst... super-agressive white sharks in the tropics that attack unrelentously towards these poor girls who have already been through so much! It becomes too much...

It's fun, suspenseful, and the cave shark is really cool and menacing. Unfortunately it takes a bad turn halfway in and gets real dumb. Then gets dumber. So hard to recommend overall."

This is a fun movie in which fairly ropey CGI sharks tear chunks out of characters who repeatedly make terrible decisions in service of the narrative.

[E]ven as [Roberts] still needs to work on creating more engaging victims, he knows exactly what to do once all hell breaks loose.
 "
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,45,68,critic,"
The film is best viewed as an amusement park ride on which you can experience the underwater, haunted house of an ancient, shark-infested, Mayan maze.
 "
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,45,68,critic,"
There's no real message here to ""Uncaged"" beyond watching some sharks eviscerate a young girl's entire life and livelihood.
 "
47 Meters Down: Uncaged,45,68,critic,"
In trying to one-up the first film, Uncaged becomes more cartoonish and unrealistic (granted, not in the league of The Meg), but that also makes it more fun than the downer original.

However, once the relationship begins, the movie hits a brick wall and never really recovers.  The tension building scenes are cliche, worn out and not filmed particularly well.

The Operative,41,,critic,"
Three strong central performances can't overcome a lack of consistent suspense in this espionage thriller that generates a handful of taut twists yet too often settles for genre conventions.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
The Operative tackles Israel's intelligence efforts against Iran, but fails to resonate or be insightful. A good lead performance from Diane Kruger doesn't overcome the narrative problems.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
With a clumsy flashback structure, The Operative never quite reaches a full boil, coming off - like its heroine - as an entity without a country
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
The Operative certainly operates on its own terms. I'm just not quite sure what they are.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
As far as modern espionage films go, 'The Operative' simply doesn't operate on the highest level: neither exceptional nor terrible, it falls in the mediocre middle.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
The Operative is a bland and convoluted affair that struggles to keep the audience engaged and leaves minimal impact during its runtime.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
The Operative gets lost in its own machinations and clichés too much for me to highly recommend it.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
Failing both as a character drama and as a taut espionage drama, The Operative is a film as generic and uninspiring as its title that even fans of the genre will find wanting.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
An espionage story that gets us wondering who we trust and why.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
A solidly crafted if forgettable espionage thriller.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
The bulk of the story ... feels like the prologue to a more vital tale.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
Painfully slow and hardly captivating, ""The Operative"" is another generic thriller that'll come and go without so much as making a blip on anyone's radar.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
Diane Kruger is finally getting the roles she deserves. This movie, though sometimes flawed, is worth seeing her performance alone.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
The film takes its sweet time, but it's a slow burn with twists that'll shock.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
As the film crawls towards its conclusion, there's not much of a sense of righteous anger in Rachel at her Israeli masters after she believes she's been used. Audiences will rightly feel they have been used too.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
A serviceable but not stylish filmmaker, Adler shoots office spaces and restaurants in a blandly shadowy style redolent of peak TV.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
Fans of John le Carre should receive a mild charge out of ""The Operative,"" which strives to be an intelligent understanding of espionage and the dangers emotional ties bring to the ways of government-sponsored spying.
 "
The Operative,41,,critic,"
The film has all the usual set pieces, but they play out in ways that feel unnervingly real.

Murder Mystery,44,42,audience,This movie was a bit....far fetched. The plot twist wasn't that surprising and the characters weren't that great either. By the end of the movie I was tiered of the sappy story. It was just a dumb and not well executed movie. The humor was terrible too. It tried to be funny but it wasn't. It might've been a good movie if it was made different.
Murder Mystery,44,42,audience,"The real mystery is how does Adam Sandler keep getting roles? Can anyone remember the last good movie he starred in?
   Save yourself 90 minutes and pass on this."
Murder Mystery,44,42,audience,"Slow, bland and disappointing"
Murder Mystery,44,42,audience,"I usually love Adam sander films and I love Jenifer Aniston... but this film was so bad. The acting was terrible, the storyline was boring and overall under whelming. Very disappointed."
Murder Mystery,44,42,audience,if your an adult it's just ok but it's the perfect watch for a 10-14 year old my siblings loved it and it was entertaining enough that it kept me engaged if you have 90 minutes to kill it's pretty cute and i would watch it again all in all it's not bad
Murder Mystery,44,42,audience,feels like watching a made for tv film but ultimately watchable 
Murder Mystery,44,42,audience,"Boring and absolute garbage, poor acting.. just like all Sandlers films🙄"
Murder Mystery,44,42,audience,One of the better movies in Adam Sandler's filmography.
Murder Mystery,44,42,audience,Good for a brainless watch
Murder Mystery,44,42,audience,Great movie to watch with your friends and family.

With a plot reminiscent of Murder on the Orient Express, only this time on a Mediterranean yacht, Murder Mystery has a summer vibe that combines thriller and comedy.

A good cast tries to carry this mediocre film.

It would be welcome to see more movies between them in the same vein, even if Murder Mystery was a bit of an uninspired trek...
 "
Murder Mystery,44,42,critic,"
Murder Mystery is neither a comedy nor a mystery. It's just bad behavior masquerading as mass entertainment.

The problem with this movie is it's just not funny. I don't know if I even laughed one time.

Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler are no strangers to comedy, so they try their best. But most of their comic banter falls flat.

Murder Mystery is a lively hodgepodge.

The best that can be said of Murder Mystery is that it's a mildly amusing experience that won't offend but will most certainly evaporate from the mind soon after.

The biggest mystery soon becomes: why make this movie in the first place? Besides to give these hardworking actors an overseas vacation.

The Aniston/Sandler spark we have seen before is somehow missing in this pedestrian dramedy. You expect more but you get less.

Some of the good things about this film is it's not way too long like some Netflix films. Also the presence of well-known actors like Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston give it more laughs.

Thanks to a deft, funny script by James Vanderbilt and brisk direction by Kyle Newacheck, this throwback comedy turns out to be an easygoing charmer.

A mildly amusing whodunit that's just as irrelevant as Netflix's throwaway Adam Sandler comedies that have come before.

I Am Mother,91,75,audience,"La mayoría de las peliculas originales de Netflix suelen ser muy malas, pero esta fue una gran excepción; tiene una muy buena trama y excelentes actuaciones; una joya en el catálogo de Netflix."
I Am Mother,91,75,audience,"I am Mother é um filme tenso, envolvente e com uma historia muito bem contada, os realizadores conseguiram fazer um filme pós apocalíptico sem cenas extraordinárias de destruição fatal do mundo,  mas fazendo todos entenderem oque está acontecendo, a fotografia do filme é realmente incrível . O roteiro poderia muito bem ganhar um Oscar, colocando tudo de incrível em um único roteiro, deixando leve."
I Am Mother,91,75,audience,"Interesting movie, but in the near future we won't be competing with artificial intelligence, humans and AI will become one."
I Am Mother,91,75,audience,"Another movie that hinges on the ""big reveal"", the purpose behind the entire movie.  The audience is dragged along, raising the anticipation of what the big secret is, forcing the audience to endure long silences and cryptic musings to play on their hopes that this won't be another disappointment like so many other movies that follow this strategy.  Alas, disappointment once again reigns supreme when the payoff is nowhere near the boredom endured to get to the end, with all of its vagaries and incompleteness.  Very unsatisfying."
I Am Mother,91,75,audience,The acting really shines through in this movie! With quite a limited backdrop it becomes so important. The story is tight and coherent. The timing between suspense and relief is spot on.
I Am Mother,91,75,audience,Definite must see with a great twist!
I Am Mother,91,75,audience,"Its a good movie until the lat 5 minutes. One teenage girl, 350,000 embryos"
I Am Mother,91,75,audience,"Sci Fi at its finest, visually engaging and an interesting reflection about IA, parenting and humans."
I Am Mother,91,75,audience,"I found the movie to be pretty original, surprising and thought-provoking."
I Am Mother,91,75,audience,"Although when watching Sci-Fi we expect a departure from reality, I still want to believe that ""it could happen"".  This movie does that.  Great story line with just the right mix of drama and action.  Great acting too."
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
Personally I thought it was an interesting mystery that showed its trust in the small cast.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
A sci-fi film that gives equal importance to character-driven drama as its visual effects. Clara Rugaard is phenomenal in her breakthrough performance as a daughter forced to choose between two not-entirely-trustworthy maternal figures.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
What's impressive about I Am Mother is that it starts out with a rock-solid concept for a thought-provoking film and then keeps on adding to it. This is the rare science fiction film that gives the audience maybe a little too much to think about.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
Australian filmmaker Grant Sputore's direction keeps viewers on their toes, and we never quite know who to trust.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
This is where I Am Mother distinguishes itself - bypassing doomsday to what happens in the aftermath, and how we come back.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
Anchored by a fantastically assured Clara Rugaard, I Am Mother is a speculative springboard for rich discussions about prosthetic nurturing and the moral cost of engineering the greater good.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
I Am Mother has a simple narrative but one that is executed with skill and flair. The cinematography, lighting, sound work and acting all come together to deliver a satisfying movie.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
A movie that's apparently all about motherhood and female connection (and maybe a little about abortion?) was completely written, directed, and executive-produced by men.

A pretty good start that feels rushed at the end and ultimately damages a promising movie. [Full review in Spanish].

I Am Mother exudes visual sophistication-specifically with its production design, which is intriguing and well suited.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
It's not a wildly imaginative film, but like a lot of Netflix fare, it's a serviceable, well-acted, entertaining and at times intriguing film.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
The real problem, here and in many original Netflix films, is that emotional means are lacking, and the artificially created mother-daughter relationship has, paradoxically, the same effect of artifice. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
The joy of director Grant Sputore's debut lies less in the actual plot than in the breakout performance by Clara Rugaard, the affecting work of Hilary Swank, and the ideas the film plants in the mind of the viewer for further examination.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
It's an exciting film to watch, but an even better one to think about after - preferably in the company of a real, physically present person.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
It's rich material, handled brilliantly by first-time feature director Grant Sputore, a West Australian, working from an intelligently wrought screenplay from American Michael Lloyd-Green.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
An intriguing premise, fine performances and a string of startling reveals that just keeps on coming make this Australian sci-fi film a real winner -- and a must-watch for the Black Mirror set.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
Writer-director Grant Sputore does a nice job of ramping up the tension and leaving the viewer guessing as to the eventual outcome.
 "
I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
I Am Mother offers some interesting social commentary on the idea of motherhood but stops just short of making its point.

I Am Mother,91,75,critic,"
It's exciting to live in these kinds of thought experiments, and then think through it all as the credits roll.

The Perfection,72,57,audience,A little too corny but entertaining I guess 
The Perfection,72,57,audience,So apparently the best way to send a message to a brainwashed person is to chop off his hand!! You could think of many other ways than to CHOP OFF A FRICKING HAND to send a message
The Perfection,72,57,audience,Thrilling and psychological.
The Perfection,72,57,audience,"This movie was appalling, It was off to a good start but after learning more of the characters ""reasoning"" and the choices made by the characters throughout the movie is idiotic and immature. The movie had potential to take a sensitive and serious subject such as sexual assault and how the two characters could work through it together and support themselves in a healthy and meaningful relationship, but no. The main actress cuts off Lizzy's hand and then the movie instantly and irresponsibly switches from a horror thriller to disgusting and meaningless end. Showing nudity is ok, but showing nudity in the concept of a scene involving sexual assault. That is just unbelievable, I can't believe what I just watched. 

Lol f*** this movie, Its disgusting, BYYYE"
The Perfection,72,57,audience,"If there's one thing that Richard Shepard's The Perfection can't be accused of lacking, it's its daring originality. I genuinely had no idea what direction this film was heading and for that alone, it deserves respect and kudos. I can't honestly say it's a film for everyone or even that it reached its final destination having convinced of its twists and turns but I'll be damned if I wasn't intrigued and entertained. There's certainly an absurdity to the whole proceedings but it's delivered with such conviction that it's nothing short of nail-biting engrossment."
The Perfection,72,57,audience,"I don't know why the audience score for this movie is so low because this movie literally gave me a panic attack. There were a lot of twists and action and I honestly got whiplash during the second half. It starts off sort of ""normal"" but you can sort of tell that something weird is coming and by the time you think you know what's going on, you realize that it's even worse. I would definitely recommend it if you do not mind a lot of gore."
The Perfection,72,57,audience,"i honestly don't even KNOW how i feel about this movie lol. first off, the idea is there, i guess - but it was executed in the worst way possible. the editing is messy. the soundtrack is HORRIBLE (at some points it sounds like a 2000's Disney comedy aimed at teenagers and not a 'thriller' movie). the two main actresses were the only savable aspect of it - the acting is really good. 

when i reached the end i didn't even believe i was watching the same film. the basic idea of the plot is... okay and you could make a decent movie if the writers actually knew HOW to go with it. but they didn't."
The Perfection,72,57,audience,I just came across this one day and I was blown away I've told everyone they must see this movie
The Perfection,72,57,audience,"This is such a bad movie. None of the characters get introduced properly, it relies heavily on flashbacks and becomes feels more and more winged with all 28 twists. Also, if you're a musician, spare yourself."
The Perfection,72,57,audience,"This is absolutely worth a watch.  The acts are almost individual movies in their own right and the twists, at least in my opinion, were unpredictable and very clever.  It was maybe a little far fetched at times but I was engrossed from start to finish.  The production was a little frustrating though.  The rewind scenes that they incorporated took away from storyline slightly and just seemed a little amateur.  Definitely recommend watching.  Fun watch!"
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
The Perfection aims high and wide with its imagery and absolutely bonkers twists and turns, but never quite lands among the high-brow pantheon of films it's inspired by...
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
Director Richard Shepard puts the material on edge by stylizing it heavily from the jump, setting up more split-diopter shots than you're likely to see in a year of movie-watching
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
Unfortunately... The Perfection is anything but.
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
Its later stretches are as topical as they are confused at points. It's trying something, but by the end, The Perfection's title isn't a reference to the movie itself.
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
Production values are high and the two leads play a perfect fiddle to one and other, but the switchback plot, while fun initially, plays on too long.
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
It is complexly, an emotionally draining, exhilirating, and liberating quest.
 "

The fact that most of it works pretty well is a happy, bloody, and creepy surprise.
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
It's difficult to know when bungled takes are compensated by good enough film-making that the end result is acceptable...
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
Entertaining in a way that's at once showy and rather clinical.
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
In its final form, this one-of-a-kind genre Frankenstein is a stand-out terror in an increasingly inventive and competitive field. Controversial, slippery, and sickening, The Perfection will get you screaming, then talking.
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
For those who like their films a little darker than mainstream studios are willing to bankroll, The Perfection might be right for you. It's dirty, messy moviemaking with a message.
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
This movie is insane and I totally dug it. I almost don't want to talk about it... Just go see it and trust me on this.
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
As the twists and turns get even more egregious, The Perfection just becomes a chore to watch. It's unfortunate because the final beat is actually chilling and portends what could have been. A lighter touch would have been welcome.
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
A horror-thriller with humorous elements and a playful structure.
 "
The Perfection,72,57,critic,"
Violent, gory horror-thriller; language, sex, nudity.

The biggest twist here is that an apparently sophisticated thriller turns out to be grotesquely dumb and misguided. [Full review in Spanish]

Is it pleasurable? Here and there. It's more gripping than entertaining; it squeezes us, it pulls on the short hairs of our temples. It establishes and maintains control -- bullying control.

A weird but awesome movie about the limits of human kindness and evil. Trailers for this movie should be banned for the sake of viewers. [Full review in Spanish].
 "

It works more than when it does not, and results in a relatively disposable piece of pop horror.

This Allison Williams vehicle teeters on the precipice of dementedly inappropriate camp. Unfortunately, it revels too much in a vile plot twist reminiscent of too many real-life, horrific stories.

See You Yesterday,95,39,audience,It's just a black movie with horrible performances
See You Yesterday,95,39,audience,"You know you're watching a bad movie when everybody is more charasmatic and more interesting than the main character, CJ, portrayed by Eden Duncan-Smith.
For a character that's supposed to be smart and thoughtful, CJ makes a lot of poor decisions that come with unintended consequences... of course, this later makes sense from a screenwriting perspective because writer/director Stefon Bristol needed to have complications in the later scenes. And that's when you felt the manipulation of the writer/director that takes you out of the story and you lose that suspension of disbelief. To make matters worse, Duncan-Smith does a poor job of getting me to care for her or feel what she's going through. 
The movie did a nice job of creating an authentic, believable NYC environment that offered a glimpse into a colorful community. But the lackluster ending and the manipulation to make the ending happen is simply bad filmmaking. This story feels like Bristol is pushing the same philosophy that Spike was selling in ""Do The Right Thing"" -- to break the cycle of violence you must continue to do what has been done in the past. It's no wonder nothing ever changes."
See You Yesterday,95,39,audience,creative twist on time travel
See You Yesterday,95,39,audience,"The actors are not bad, the screens are down to earth and that's what the 2 stars are for. 
Time travel is a powerful tool, no director should use it without adding something extra/new. Otherwise, the movie will fall short of the great classics. Like this one did. But what made my head turn left and right a lot is how mentioning nonsense science was a good idea, I would have preferred some gibberish instead.
About the end: just does not give anything. At least it is not too long even though it feels like it."
See You Yesterday,95,39,audience,"It starts as a fun authentic teen movie and becomes far more serious fast.  This is smart, painful movie that shows courageous young people struggling against the terrible wrongs of modern society."
See You Yesterday,95,39,audience,"Movie was ok but what a crap ending.
Guess theres a part 2. Got sucked into that one. They should say it's a series. Something was telling me not to watch it."
See You Yesterday,95,39,audience,"I stopped watching the exact minute CJ decided to throw slushie during their first successful time-travel attempt.

The story portrayed CJ as someone who are smart, aiming for MIT scholarship, and capable of inventing time-machine, and that all being thrown out of the windows the moment she unnecessarily decided to mess with the past and created a butterfly effect."
See You Yesterday,95,39,audience,"Excellent take on sci-fi and current social issues in th US. Striking debut! I loved it. The ending is perfect, too"
See You Yesterday,95,39,audience,"There are much better time travel movies, although this one felt the time spirit more."
See You Yesterday,95,39,audience,"I am an avid fan of all time travel movies, because I love going through the mental gymnastics of the cause-and-effect scenarios that arise from this kind of thing. Throw in a smart cameo of Michael J. Fox and you have me on board even more. See You Yesterday takes a stab at the genre and uses the Back to the Future formula for most of its time-travel logic. This is perhaps the most straightforward way of utilizing the idea because you don’t have to take into account predestination or anything like that. Things don’t change until the time travel happens. The movie has some mumbo-jumbo explanation for the science, but mostly assumes you’ll just buy into the idea that it is possible so they can shortcut through the story to the more interesting parts. The only time this felt lazy to me was when the characters instantly assume that they can’t run into their past selves, which seems to be a rule solely based on other time-travel movies that is used for convenience here. Truth be told, See You Yesterday is only somewhat about time travel. This movie has more to say about the black experience in America and is quite relevant in a time when police brutality and the entire Black Lives Matter movement are taking center stage on a daily basis. Without giving away the entire plot of the film, we’ll just say the inciting incident of See You Yesterday is a police shooting, and that’s what increases the stakes for our time-traveling teens. I thought that the film did an interesting thing with the story and symbolically addressed the fact that there are no easy answers for these problems. It will take more than 10 minutes to fix what is wrong with our nation. That’s the important thing to learn from this movie, and the time travel just makes the message more palatable. I kind of wish they could have toned down the language because this seems like a movie that would be great for young people to have fun and stop and think a little at the same time. The lead actors in See You Yesterday leave a little to be desired. Eden Duncan-Smith didn’t pull off all the emotions necessary for what could be an extremely intense role, considering all the things she is trying to handle. I certainly bought her as the brainy type who could come up with all this technology, but the rest of her line-readings seemed a bit flat and rushed. Dante Crichlow was a little better, but still lacked some of the range I’d like to see from his character. They didn’t ruin the movie for me, but when they went for some of the more powerful moments I wasn’t impacted as much as I wanted because the actors weren’t getting there themselves. The supporting cast is solid though, and one of the final moments of the movie hit me harder than anything else because of a performance by “Astro.” Despite some of its shortcomings, I still found See You Yesterday to be a satisfying time-travel film that blended entertainment pretty seamlessly with the message, and I’d gladly watch it again."
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
This movie has a very attractive cast of talented young actors who go a long way towards making this downbeat story more palatable. It was also a treat to see the most famous time traveler of all in the film, Michael J. Fox.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
See You Yesterday shows people, no matter what their age, that life is not about changing the past but how we move forward.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
As a debut feature from writer-director Stefon Bristol and co-writer Fredrica Bailey, See You Yesterday is an ambitious sci-fi in its own right, and a worthy entry into the canon of black representation.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
Welding a Black Lives Matter message onto a time-travel movie with a tone somewhere between Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Do the Right Thing makes this an ambitious flick.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
A heady mix of clever plotting, sharp street humour, phat reggae beats and an emotional gut punch to rival recent cinema releases Blackkklansman or Detroit.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
With impeccable, emotional acting from Smith and scenes that may be difficult for viewers to watch, See You Yesterday starts out feeling lighthearted, fun and real.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
Though the movie encounters some of the usual pitfalls of time-travel plots (predictability, muddled rules) and sports some hokey, eighties-style special effects, what it offers in terms of diversity and messaging is a treasure.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
Back to the Future meets urban scientific teens on Netflix is the bomb.com. It' a refreshing spin on an old classic time travel tale with a really cute cameo by Michael J. Fox. It's fun, fresh and relevant with subtle police shooting thematics
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
The film's rumination on grief does not always pair seamlessly with its spitfire teen comedy half but Bristol's debut film is all the more gnarly and compelling for this lack of seamlessness.

Kick back on a night when you're looking for both gravity and glee (emphasis on the gravity), and enjoy.

It gives us a wonderful black female character, the message of both despair and hope, and a story that could easily be continued as a popular Netflix series.

See You Yesterday is a film not to be taken at face value. It is a film that is multi-layered and crafted to deliver each layer in a timely and thought-provoking manner.
 "

See You Yesterday doesn't sacrifice the child-like wonder of adventure for a grounded story. For a film in this genre, the stakes are higher than ever before.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
An extremely promising concept is lent a disappointingly indifferent treatment in this low-fi, low-effort time travel romp.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
No matter the inspired cinematography or considered, authentic performances, these stories carry a weight of inevitability as they suck every particle of hope out of the air.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
Significantly more thoughtful than your average Netflix original movie, See You Yesterday marks Bristol and Duncan-Smith as ones to watch.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
A powerful and poignant film centered on a wonderfully flawed protagonist whose hard-earned lessons in this film leave a profound impact with the viewer long after the credits roll.
 "
See You Yesterday,95,39,critic,"
The teenagers speak with authentic voices, and Bristol builds a believable world for them (they conduct their science experiments inside Sebastian's grandmother's garage) without bogging them down in science.
 "
The Silence,29,25,audience,"Pretty cool post-apocalyptic flick. I like the casting and the pacing of the film. The main actress and her father did well, actually the whole family working as a silent unit worked well, and the creatures make a good antagonist. But of course, humans are the worst antagonist of them all. The VFX guys did a great job."
The Silence,29,25,audience,"It's a blatant rip-off of the Quiet Place, the story is the same, a family running from and trying to survive blind monsters that kills anything that makes noise, hell they even have a deaf girl that benefits from her deafness in this movie too! The continuity regarding the vesps' hearing and strength wasn't good either, one moment they can hear someone quietly walking on a dirt road, and then the next they can't hear people talking to each other, and apparently, they can tear through human flesh very easily but can't break glass with a couple of hits? I have to give credit where credit is due though, the characters were likable and relatable, the monsters looked cool yet frightening, most of the characters' choices were fairly smart, I like how they kept trying to find out more about the vesps instead of running away from them, and I found myself intrigued by the monsters and wanting to know more about them. Overall this movie was bad, but it wasn't the worst thing on Netflix and certainly not the worst horror movie out there."
The Silence,29,25,audience,"It's a shame everyone thinks they ""copied"" A Quiet Place. I thought it was an interesting plot, had memorable characters, I enjoyed the acting, and I give it 4/5 stars. Likely didn't have the largest budget ever approved, but I think they did well enough and it's entertaining. I was engaged the entire time. The ending is actually one of my favorite parts. The last 20 minutes is really great! Really sad to see others comparing it side by side to A Quiet Place. That's really not fair. Judge them separately."
The Silence,29,25,audience,Nothing original... Clearly a copy of A Quiet Place.
The Silence,29,25,audience,A decent thriller that can't be helped being quite similar to A Quiet Place but still good on it's own merits
The Silence,29,25,audience,"I felt like this movie was way too similar to a quiet place. But The movie was pretty good for the most part, but it didn't really have an objective or a satisfying ending. It had cool ideas."
The Silence,29,25,audience,"First of all, this movie is not a rip-off of A Quiet Place. This movie is based off of a book that came out in 2015. Second of all, it is not a mix between Bird Box and A Quiet Place. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and everyone who says the acting was terrible is blind. Kiernan Shipka and Stanley Tucci are fantastic in this movie and for once the family is not composed of stupid people that make the worst possible decisions. The movie also wraps up nicely in the end without any irritating cliff hangers that leave you without resolution."
The Silence,29,25,audience,"A group of explorers uncover a previously unexplored network of tunnels in a cave system that unleashes some very nasty bat like creatures that soon begin to invade all of the towns and cities throughout the US.
I'm always surprised each year by the number of films that are released that are so very similar with their themes.  This is the poor man's version of A Quiet Place.  There is no possible way this film was ever going to live up to one of the best and most tense horrors I have ever seen but even so, it was still mildly entertaining.   It's not a direct copy as a family leave the city to try and find sanctuary only to become prey to a very sinister cult living out in the wilds.  Sound was used well, the creatures looked good and there were moments of tension but I can't imagine anyone would choose this over A Quiet Place."

The Silence,29,25,critic,"
The Silence is a painful attempt to remake A Quiet Place, which came out the year before. Though this is based on a 2015 novel of the same name, the story has already been done perfectly, leaving little to be desired in this straight-to-streaming flick.

Somewhere deep beneath an underground cavern, something shockingly dreadful is accidentally unleashed upon the world: It's a near-unwatchable disaster of a Netflix horror movie called The Silence.
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
The Silence is a dull affair that reads aloud from many pages in the Big Book of Horror Tropes...
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
Rather than settling for following a successful formula, The Silence pushes the tried-and-true premise from its upsetting origins to its unthinkable limits.

The Silence,29,25,critic,"
Filmmaker John R. Leonetti delivers a blisteringly-paced opening stretch that effectively establishes the cataclysmic scenario...
 "

The Silence feels like a cheap rip-off of better products.
 "

The Silence makes very little sense. But it's very entertaining, so you might as well just watch it so you can tweet about it.
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
This ""stay silent or die"" end-of-the-world jam is less pretentious than John Krasinski's debut, which is good. It also trades Emily Blunt for Kiernan Shipka, which is not an even trade, even with rabid bat-dinosaurs thrown in to sweeten the deal.
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
What should be the emotional core falls flat, with her story only vaguely alluded to and a lack of any meaningful progression in their relationship.

Whether you're a horror fan who enjoys jump scares, gore, monsters, or a sharp social commentary, Netflix movie The Silence will satisfy none.
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
The Silence doesn't manage to captivate its audience like it should, and it certainly doesn't bring anything new to its genre. Ultimately, the greatest thing it achieves is that it makes the viewer appreciate A Quiet Place even more.
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
The estimable trio at the heart of the cast goes close to carrying the whole thing over the line, but it never feels as taut or kinetic as it needs to be.
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
The Silence throws the taut brilliance of A Quiet Place into sharp relief, simply by doing everything wrong that the latter feature does right.
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
Suspenseful dystopian horror movie has violence, cursing.
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
Not a knockoff of that other quiet horror flick, though this familiar monster movie works hard to convince otherwise. But the terrific cast makes it worth a look, at least for Netflix subscribers.
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
The Silence is worth a watch because of Tucci and Tucci alone, but if you crave a good film, just pick up a copy of A Quiet Place instead.
 "
The Silence,29,25,critic,"
The Silence is a thoroughly bad movie that will make you wish you were watching something else.

Though it all, The Silence never loses its tension and the plot unfolds in a natural progression leading to an ending that feels perfectly deserved and fulfilling.

The Highwaymen,58,73,audience,This is a very good film on many levels. The cinematography is impressive and really captures the feel of the 1930s Depression Era. It's an atmospheric slow burn with great acting performances and natural chemistry between the two leads Costner and Harrelson. It's not a big budget epic or crammed with CGI but it tells and interesting story well and really keeps you watching until the end.
The Highwaymen,58,73,audience,The Highwaymen is a sometimes slow but superbly acted movie from Netflix starring Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson telling the story of how Bonnie and Clyde were finally taken down. Worth your time if you're into movies about American history.
The Highwaymen,58,73,audience,Great movie reflecting on a part of history we have all heard about but don't know many details.  It feels like the first bonnie and clyde story told that doesn't idolize the criminals
The Highwaymen,58,73,audience,"Do not listen to the critics, this movie is AMAZING. Costner and Woody are so damn good. There is a reason they are movie stars. This is the type of movie hollywood used to make so well. Great cops and robbers flick with just the right amount of backstory. Easily a top ten film of the year."
The Highwaymen,58,73,audience,This is an awesome movie!  Great cast and really well put together.  The 58% rating is totally unfair!
The Highwaymen,58,73,audience,...instead of a shootout every 2 minutes this is an engaging character study of two lawmen and how they go about getting their prey.Critics are wrong as usual.Excellent film.
The Highwaymen,58,73,audience,"Enjoyed the movie despite the slow pace. It was interesting to bonnie & clyde depicted as villains. However, it would have been even better to show their perspective cause like they only look like stone cold villains."
The Highwaymen,58,73,audience,"This is the result of film directors believing that two big name actors paired up with two infamous characters would be enough to carry the film. Although, the Costner and Harrelson duo is enough to keep the audience entertained throughout the film, it's void of commitment to the theme led to a blank understanding of whos focus was this film centered upon. With two overwhelming ingredients in a capped cauldron, it is no wonder why this filmed failed to deliver it's potential intentions."
The Highwaymen,58,73,audience,Exceeded expectations.  Surprised by the low eating on 🍅 meter. Worth every moment
The Highwaymen,58,73,audience,"An Intelligent, suspenseful, refreshing and often funny movie! This film is extremely suspenseful without needing to spurt blood everywhere. The history is good and allows the viewer insight into how life must have been during the great depression: the camps of displaced people, the public's dislike of big business and banks, the public awe of the new film industry. I enjoyed the intelligent screen play, with smart dialogue (gotta pay attention viewer or you'll miss the running gags) a clear portrayal of how killing other humans is not something without consequences to one's soul and seeing that the line between bad and good isn't always that clear. Kevin Costner, Woody Harrelson and Kathy Bates are great! Looking forward to watching it again for details I missed!"

It's unfair to hold such a modest effort to the high standard of the 1967 masterpiece. ... Still, it's a fine companion piece that's the type of old-fashioned, midrange, character-driven story that we don't get often enough these days.

The Highwaymen is a well-done period piece and stands out as an original Bonnie and Clyde themed tale.

Triple Frontier,71,55,audience,"buncha bros on a south american vacation, just havin the best time"
Triple Frontier,71,55,audience,"This movie has got an all-star cast, which is why I started watching it in the first place. I mean, who wouldn't want to watch a movie with Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund, and Pedro Pascal in action roles! And although I may not like the movie, I am by no means faulting the actors. They performances are all outstanding.
   The first forty five minutes are great. We see the characters get together and form their plan, and then execute it with brutal precision in a cinematically entertaining way. If that's all there was to this movie, I would have loved it. But from here on, it all goes wrong. 
   Without spoiling too much, a series of events causes them to lose most of the money, and what they decide to do with it at the end made the entire movie seem pointless. The last hour and fifteen minutes of the movie was pretty boring, the most exciting thing that happened being a mountain shootout and a generic car chase scene. 
   Triple Frontier has an amazing cast, great acting, and a riveting first hour, but the rest of the movie really disappoints. I'd still recommend it to big action fans, but it won't be the best thing you've seen."
Triple Frontier,71,55,audience,I completed it and I was disappointed in myself for not switching off at the end.

Triple Frontier,71,55,audience,"One Trip to the Theater without Snacks

Five guys, buddies from old war days, get together for one last hurrah, also out of necessity, attempting to take down a drug lord and snag the millions he has available. They run into challenges and issues along the way and ultimately face the question of whether money is worth their lives. 

With such a great ensemble of actors I would have expected much more out of this movie, but was sorely disappointed. I just felt as though they didn't have enough relatability for me to connect with. It was a decent movie, with a great soundtrack, but I would have loved to see if they could go a step beyond the traditional ""ex-military take down a drug lord for money"" movie, but it fell short. Would have watched it once in the theater, but wouldn't have gotten the snacks."
Triple Frontier,71,55,audience,"So, for date night, I let her pick a movie, and she chose Triple Frontier, thinking it would please me. Stand by for RANT:

I was so fucking pissed, after being conned into watching this tragic piece of shite, I went outside and popped off a few rounds just to calm down.

I had HIGH HOPES for this flick. I am a fan of all the actors in it, but the ensemble made NO SENSE. But, in real life, you get a mix bag of best friends. Not everyone looks like Chris Fucking Hemsworth, so I let it slide.

The plot was fucking ridiculous. All of a sudden you grow a conscience? I am not gonna go through the hypothetical on what my team would have done, but I will say this: IF YOU CRASH LAND WITH $250 MILLION IN CASH WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU CRASH IN A POPULATED VILLAGE AROUND PEOPLE (Which he did on purpose to follow the stupid plot of carrying the cash through the ANDES FUCKING MOUNTAINS with DONKEYS) INSTEAD OF CUTTING LOAD IN A REMOTE AREA, AND COMING BACK WITH GPS COORDINATES AND A BETTER AIRCRAFT? 

HOW THE FUCK WERE YOU GONNA LOAD 6000 lbs of cash onto that small ass fishing boat? Cutting 6 TONS of cash over it would have sunk the fucking thing. THEN THERE WAS A DINGY, they had to board from the beach. HOW THE FUCK DID YOU PLAN ON GETTING THE CASH ON THE BOAT? THE WRITER NEVER DID.

 WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU CROSSING THE ANDES IN THE FIRST FUCKING PLACE? FUCK! IF YOU CAN'T FLY OVER THE ANDES WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN CROSS WITH FUCKING DONKEYS CARRYING 6000lbs of CASH? FUCK! I hate this writer so fucking bad.

Mark Boal, the writer, is a COMPLETE SHITBAG. He wrote Military Flops Like Zero Dark Thirty, for the Obama Whitehouse, and The Hurt Locker, Two TOTALLY shit movies, that you can tell were written by a fucking NYC Jew, who NEVER served anything in his LIFE other than himself. Nothing against NYC Jews but you get the picture. Not many of them are hard charging soldiers like the characters he was writing for."

Cold Pursuit,69,49,audience,"Liam Neeson is back at it again. Glad to see him still kicking ass at 66. Seriously, can everyone stop messing with this mans family because for those that do, they get dealt with. A humorous and at times bloody tale about a father who tracks down the people responsible for his sons death. I honestly enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would; however, the whole subplot in regards to White Bull and the Native Americans could have been scrapped and the film would have been tighter by about 20+ minutes."

Won't say I didnt get a little bored at one point. Had to wonder if Mr Paunovic had the lead instead of Mr Neeson, would it have been a different or better film. Neeson usually plays an in control character with an inner calm but when required to play it in this it (sorry) did not quite stand against Mr Skarsdard's performance. At his son's funeral, was he supposed to have red knuckles then?! Because he didn't later on.
I think the original's subtitles do pull you in to the atmosphere cause I didnt feel the majesty of the scenery as much in this.
Understand Mr Neeson said some things, including that it's his last action movie - I understand he is in his 60's. D.B."

The Mule,70,66,audience,"Well-made rendition of a true crime story has its suspenseful moments, but is mainly told in an easy-going manner, suitable to the protagonist's and Eastwood's age."
The Mule,70,66,audience,"The Mule is directed by Clint Eastwood, but is a collaborative production.  Eastwood is one of twelve people given 'producer' credit.  Clint is an old guy who needs money and decides to make a drug run for the local cartel.  He keeps doing it because he likes the job.  Good enough story line, but there are some flaws.  Most noticeable is the screen writer's poor character development of the supporting roles; too broad and too thin.  The movie comes off a little flat.  I looked carefully, but couldn't find a reason to give this film any more than 2 stars.  In making The Mule, an excellent  opportunity provided by an interesting premise was missed."
The Mule,70,66,audience,Eastwood still going at 90!! You still have it.  What a sad movie.  Sad what he did to his life and sad how he tried to repair it.   Taisa F. I am sorry you're only there on your older sister.  Alison why didn't you ever do more and Dianne W. you still have it.
The Mule,70,66,audience,"Eastood has directed a number of excellent movies but this is a rare misfire. There are some interesting moments but as a whole it's honestly rather boring. The plot and narrative are flawed as the movie tries to pass off a story involving cartels, drug running and prostitution as playful and nice when in reality this would be a far more violent, dark and sinister world."
The Mule,70,66,audience,"Phenomenal, captivating, and one of his absolute best"
The Mule,70,66,audience,Definitely not up to the quality of the actors. Could be so much better but just wasn't...

The Mule,70,66,audience,"Pretty good movie.  Similar to Breaking Bad.  Eastwood and several of the cartel characters roles were well acted.  Only Eastwood's character was well developed, the others weren't.  The ending lacked much excitement and was predictable."

The film is actually highly watchable, emotionally satisfying and quite funny at times, which is a welcome shift from a lot of what Eastwood has been dishing out lately.
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
With this film, Eastwood proves, at almost 90 years old, that he can still direct and star in a light criminal drama, without exaggerated gadgets, concise in his approach. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
Return to form for Eastwood as director with this moving, eloquent, richly expressive drama.
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
Not unwatchable by any stretch, but could have been so much better in the hands of another filmmaker.
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
I think that there's a sweetness to some of the film... There is a certain self-criticism built into the role as it goes along.
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
Despite a few hiccups in the pacing, The Mule gallops quite gracefully.
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
In this incredible-but-true tale, Clint Eastwood stars as a 90-year-old horticulturalist and deadbeat dad unwittingly recruited as a drug mule for a Mexican cartel.
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
While it does fall into stereotype and is self-indulgent at times (there are two threesome scenes), it's agreeable and earnest throughout, as well as compelling in key moments.
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
[Eastwood has] made a career out of deconstructing American myth-making, and here he's not only subverting very idea of the American dream itself, but his own cinematic style.

The Mule,70,66,critic,"
A terrible portrait of redemption by a director that seems to have lost everything that made him a golden choice decades ago. [Full review in Spanish].
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
So little ultimate freshness presented here that it's difficult to muster much enthusiasm, especially for a film from someone as prolific as [Clint] Eastwood.
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
Eastwood, who began 2018 by directing the worst film of the year (The 15:17 to Paris), ended it with this solid effort that better represents his talents and his strengths.
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
While it might not be his deepest or most substantive work, the film is nevertheless very entertaining, and it offers Eastwood one of his most captivating roles as an actor in a long time.
 "
The Mule,70,66,critic,"
Dianne Wiest's performance as Earl's ex-wife is repetitive and ""acted,"" in the typical male-female dichotomy of Eastwood movies.

Eastwood in a farewell that is, at the same time, a beautiful and cruel reunion. [Full Review in Spanish]

Asher,46,36,audience,B- movie acting. Nonsensical casting. The bad guy gangsters dressed like they worked at trader joes. Below average storyline but my biggest beef is with whoever scored this thing. Seinfeld meets the good the bad and the ugly. This flick was pretty rough
Asher,46,36,audience,Who the hell is voting? This is suspense at its fright. The acting is perfect. The lead guy is perfect.
Asher,46,36,audience,Watchable fare if only for Perlman but slow  methodical march to the end.
Asher,46,36,audience,"Nothing really too wrong with this movie.  Some good action and suspense.  I never believed the Asher love story; he's too old.  Never quite understood why the bad guys went after Asher (Perlman) in the first place.  I also found it weird that bad guys kept finding Perlman so easily, but if you just enjoy the action and ignore the holes it is enjoyable."
Asher,46,36,audience,"""Hitman: Redemption"" is a B movie that fails to be something more. Great wasted cast.
(Mauro Lanari)"
Asher,46,36,audience,"It's an average Hitman movie with a decent story.  Ron Perlman is ok as Asher.  His accent is not the greatest and kind of comes and goes during the movie.  Famke Janssen does a good job with her role.  I did like this movie, but it doesn't break any new ground with it's story."
Asher,46,36,audience,Excellent film. These critics have bad taste in films.
Asher,46,36,audience,"Other than Hellboy, this is Mr. Perlman's strongest performance, a tour-de-force, as a can-do, workman-like aged assassin, who just gets the job done."
Asher,46,36,audience,Couldn't make myself pay attention to it. It was too boring.
Asher,46,36,audience,Ron Perlman should stick to racially abusing innocent school kids than churning out rubbish like this. His best is a long way behind him. 
Asher,46,36,critic,"
What ends up blurring the final feeling that leaves Asher is its outcome: equivocally open and without the courage necessary to leave grounds. [Full Review in Spanish]

Asher,46,36,critic,"
The film, after a promising start, ends up losing stamina. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
The familiarity of its over-the-hill hit-man plot leaves 'Asher' of cable or streaming-service quality, but Perlman's formidable presence makes it watchable on those secondary venues.
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
You can appreciate the character-driven approach of this crime drama while also wishing the titular protagonist had a more compelling movie in which to inhabit.
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
Asher tries to get by on the talent of its leads, but it's a dull thriller hamstrung by sloppy pacing and a poorly-constructed screenplay.
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
The simplicity in director Michael Caton-Jones' tale about a man looking to redefine his concept of right and wrong is powerful enough to carry the movie.
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
Dreyfuss sinks his teeth into his handful of scenes, while Bisset hits different but equally effective tones in her moments. The underrated Janssen, striking as ever, does her usual stellar work.
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
Nothing in the proceedings rings remotely true unless you've been weaned on a steady diet of soulful hit men movies.
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
Unfortunately the pace is so relaxed as to be meandering; and Jay Zaretsky's screenplay is cliché-packed...
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
Even when revenge doesn't connect, the softer areas of the writing do, delivering a picture that takes some dramatic risks while still delivering moments of blunt trauma.
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
""Asher"" can move slowly at times, kind of like its main character, but you find yourself rooting for the old guy.
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
[director Michael] Caton-Jones's ASHER is as much a contemplative look at being aged out of life as it is recognizing that sometimes we must break out of our ruts to get more.
 "
Asher,46,36,critic,"
As obvious and rudimentary as Asher is, it's kind of forgivable when you consider that this movie is really Perlman finally getting his chance to be the sympathetic, charismatic leading man.
 "
Prodigy,,42,audience,"Absolutely awful dialogue and performances, truly horrific. the lead the father can't deliver a line to save his life. AWFUL."
Prodigy,,42,audience,It as okay. I felt a bit sorry for the kid because he spoke as if someone nasty had kneed him very hard in his testicles.
Prodigy,,42,audience,Was a well written movie executed perfectly by the cast especially Cory Kays.  His grasp of the character was absolutely awesome.  I'm about as non religious as they come but I loved this movie even with its religious overtones.  I've told everyone I know to watch this movie.
Prodigy,,42,audience,It wasn’t terrible. Liked the dialogue and her powers. 
Prodigy,,42,audience,Cheap setting low budget. Plot and script not too bad.
Prodigy,,42,critic,"
Overall I can't say that PRODIGY  was for me, but there is an audience out there that will find some appreciation for it.
 "
Prodigy,,42,critic,"
Prodigy has a subplot that stops the main action for a few unneeded diversions, but writer-director Nathan Leon's heart is in the right place.
 "
Prodigy,,42,critic,"
Prodigy plays with some big ideas and heady themes, but doesn't fully develop all of them as it struggles to truly connect with audiences.
 "
El Verano Que Vivimos,,,audience,"the big picture of the plot is a good idea but not too much. Based on Spain's fifties with amazing Andalus south region and sunny landscapes, we enjoy a love triangle story with famous actors: Blanca Suarez and Javier Rey. The flamenco dance performance of Blanca is poor attractive. I don't know why the camera catches too small and poor views of the dance. The dialogs of Javier are fooling without any deep content, also the way they fall in love. Finally, a less know actor Pablo Molinero is the best of all, his characterization of a typical family boss is excellent, his exacerbation of emotions, and his perfect south accent."

Weathering With You,91,96,audience,"Fantastic animation and dubbing make this modern fable shine brightly. Some themes just don't click with me, but they're inoffensive. The take on blowing up an urban legend into an actual one, and the consequences on both sides, is intriguing and original. Cool moments and good characters help stick the landing with this anime. The filmmakers continuing theme of nature reclaiming the world is a peaceful and welcome one. Good anime."
Weathering With You,91,96,audience,"É um filme excelente, divertido, engraçado e tão emocionante, que o filme me fez chorar com um menino correndo. E muitas vezes o filme parece que está acontecendo nada demais, mas o filme meio que está carregando uma bateria, e na metade do filme pra frente, a bateria é totalmente descarregada em você e você não consegue segurar o choro, o riso, o nervosismo, o tudo. É um filme incomum, que eu aconselho pra qualquer um."
Weathering With You,91,96,audience,"This is awesome! I can't remember anything bad about this movie. The visuals are as expected - TOP NOTCH! The script is also well-written. The OSTs are also good and overall, A GREAT FILM!

Btw, there are some easter eggs too like Taki, Mitsuha, Yotsuha, Tessie, Sayaka etc. so keep that in mind :D"
Weathering With You,91,96,audience,"A very creative and interesting story that keeps you engaged in the characters and what will happen next. Didn't like the abrupt ending, but, hopefully more to come."
Weathering With You,91,96,audience,The story is so emotionally inspiring with the amazingly detailed visuals. The pacing and storytelling are awesome. Definitely worth watching!
Weathering With You,91,96,audience,lovely animation and intriguing story
Weathering With You,91,96,audience,"A perfectly fine, well animated film worth a watch."
Weathering With You,91,96,audience,Weathering With You wisps away any possible flaws with an awe-inspiring message that makes the film completely live up to its name.
Weathering With You,91,96,audience,Weathering with You is a beautiful and emotional film. The characters are relatable and likeable and the story is great. The films message will make you wonder/question if the choices that were made by some of the characters were the right one. Overall this is a movie was great and would definitely watch it again.
Weathering With You,91,96,audience,I did compare this to Your Name and unfortunately it was not as interesting. The animation was amazing. The characters related to each other very well. As others have mentioned the supporting characters where all strong I their own right. The movie is similar in the fact that you have another romance going on between the boy trying to figure out the mysterious female protagonist. I would have liked a different dynamic. I hope this director will try a totally different storyline. I have a feeling it would be amazing.
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
Weathering With You may have too many elements in common with Your Name, but it's a gorgeous movie with magnificent visuals and music. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
Thematically, as much as it all may seem relatively light-hearted on the surface, Weathering With You delves into some darker and more mature themes. It's a difficult balance to maintain but for the most part, it succeeds.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
Just as mystical as Your Name. but not as affecting.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
While Weathering With You may suffer from a bit of tonal whiplash across the runtime, it's an engrossing modern fable, thanks to the vibrant life that is given to this stormy, rainy, Tokyo.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
""Weathering With You"" is another great anime by the latest master of the category, and a film that everyone will enjoy watching.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
...the need to belong and be loved are universal themes that Shinkai, an expert crafter of young, teenage love stories, explores very well in 'Weathering With You.'
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
Although Weathering With You includes serious social issues about homelessness and the hazards of messing with the environment, ultimately this is a sweetly sentimental film where the biggest messages are about taking life-changing risks for true love.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
A film with a huge heart and a vivid imagination.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
[The] plotlines ... seem to be on different planes altogether ... the characterizations are lazy archetypes and many points of tension are artificial. I still enjoyed it[.]
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
Viewing this as a standalone film without all the comparisons, it's hard to deny the wonderfully charming chemistry between Hina and Hodaka.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
I love this movie.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
It is hard for anyone in the Japanese animation industry to escape the legend of Miyazaki. But Shinkai is paving his own path and he expands on the success of Your Name with Weathering with You.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
Weathering With You also explores the myriad effects of climate change on our industrialized society, but I think its message is one of simultaneous resignedness and hope.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
Another essential slice of thumping, bittersweet genius from one of Japan's great modern anime auteurs.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
This is anime remixed with romance and rock opera ballads - much more of a confection than a social critique. Weathering With You is a typhoon-infused fantasy grounded in a tangible reality.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
This film's simply too soggy to live up to Shinkai's other films, box-office success be damned.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
Weathering With You does a poor job of balancing its supernatural weather story with its central romance.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
Makoto Shinkai's sixth feature-length cartoon, Weathering with You, oozes visual lyricism and primal yearning.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
In WEATHERING WITH YOU, despite falling back on familiar Shinkai tropes, it's still a unique enough tale of the magic that inhabits our beautiful world that we can easily fail to notice.
 "
Weathering With You,91,96,critic,"
Weathering With You is a worthy follow-up to the phenomenon of Your Name., with a much more vital message.

Extraction,67,69,audience,good action movie it could use a bit more of drama scenaBut if you're looking for a movie action packed this is the movie for you.
Extraction,67,69,audience,"As an action movie it excels with truly excellent choreography and cinematography.

Seems to be targeting the feel of ""John Wick"" and will fall short in most ways, but no reason to avoid this if you want to mostly turn off your brain and enjoy the ride."
Extraction,67,69,audience,"At first, a couple of the Indian actors' interactions and Chris Hemsworth's sullen cliff-diving, underwater meditation, made me think this film was going to be akin to a 90's action flick: high on action, low on acting. But I am glad to say I misread it.

There were no true heroes but redemption came for some hardened family men who knew the world was a dark place. Love and empathy prevailed. Not all of the bad guys were inherently evil, though at least two were pure bastards. I look forward to a part 2 with more multiple bad-to-the-bone encounters between fighters and returning characters. Keep the talking to a minimal and focus on the action like this first film did."
Extraction,67,69,audience,"Being a big fan of Chris Hemsworth, I think he sold it in the film. The actions were straight to the point and carefully choreographed. Fight scenes and gunfire were epic, but plot and storyline is amature. Overall I give this film a 3 stars, and the ending is kinda interesting. I like'd to think Tyler did not die after all...."
Extraction,67,69,audience,"What started as a way to pass the time during the Early weeks of the pandemic turned out to be a nail biting, roller coaster ride with Chris Hemsworth.   A very enjoyable, action packed rescue film that will blow you away.   In addition to solid performances and great action, much of the movie is filmed on a single mobile camera which manages to really make the viewer a part of the adventure."
Extraction,67,69,audience,"This film is no good for the industry. It is some money thing for netflix. I am really unhappy after read the fact. Here
https://dubdubi.com/extraction-what-left-behind-the-film"
Extraction,67,69,audience,"Best film I've seen, all the action sequences tell you something about the character, and the story in general is great."
Extraction,67,69,audience,Extraction (2020) – The film has pretty good action and looks very nice for the genre. It also has quite appealing characters but lacks a true standout. The plot is quite generic for the most part but is well executed.
Extraction,67,69,audience,"As good as the running gun battles and car chases are filmed, with up close and follow along long shots of the action, is how bad the young actor who plays the kidnap victim is.  His facial expressions are completely incongruous with what is happening on screen, his movements clearly show that he was just trying to hit his marks, even his wide-eyed rapid eye movement does not track the action.  Unfortunately, the movie tries to hard at tugging at the heart strings using this young actor, when fails miserably.  If it had just stuck to the action it would have been a far better movie."
Extraction,67,69,audience,"Was gripped from beginning to end. The choreography was brilliant, guns sound real, and the story was amazing. Highly recommend watching if you want a movie night, great from beginning to end. 👌🏻"
Extraction,67,69,critic,"
Extraction is one of those mostly brainless action movies that is best enjoyed for the intensity of its fight and chase scenes. If you can focus on those and not the story, you're in for a fun time.
 "
Extraction,67,69,critic,"
It's nothing we hadn't seen before, but when it comes to its action and its stunt work, it's something we haven't seen done this well for quite some time.

Hits like a ton of bricks...dumb as a sack of rocks.
 "
Extraction,67,69,critic,"
'Extraction' is indeed full of shootouts, fight sequences and chase scenes. The body count is relentless. But amid all of the action, the relationship between fathers and sons is at the heart of the film.
 "
Extraction,67,69,critic,"
""Extraction"" is a bone-rattling, epic fifteen rounds of urban warfare rescue mission with a soulful and redemptive career-best dramatic performance from Hemsworth.
 "

Despite Extraction's issues with a very minimal story, it's a lot of fun. The action is a non-stop, hyperventilating barrage of greatness.

Hemsworth's leading charisma is enough to keep you glued to this (occasionally magnetic) thrill ride.

Accidentally as close as anyone has come to capturing a ""Call of Duty"" game on film (right down to the agreeably over-the-top, very VERY R-rated body-count and blood-spilling.

Extraction,67,69,critic,"
It's a mediocre and humorless suspense film with suffocating dialog and ham-fisted metaphors, however it's immensely popular with viewers.
 "

Extraction's centerpiece is undoubtedly a prolonged, single-take shot that's nothing short of mind-blowing in terms of its audacity and effectiveness.
 "

This is for folks who like Rambo movies with a lot of carnage delivered by likable actors, which Hemsworth is.
 "
Extraction,67,69,critic,"
An incredibly fun, exciting and action-packed Blockbuster, which I really enjoyed! It's everything we were promised... and not much else. But for a film like this, not much else is really needed... switch your brain off and have some mindless fun.
 "
Extraction,67,69,critic,"
It all builds to a sacrificial finale that rips off ""Man on Fire"" with its bridge heroics and ""The Bourne Identity"" with an underwater plunge, only without the Moby soundtrack.
 "
Extraction,67,69,critic,"
Because almost all the main characters in the movie act like killing machines, there's almost a video-game quality to Extraction that's disappointing for a feature film that could have been better.
 "
SCOOB!,47,54,audience,"I didn't like it. It was a very meh film. It was kind of lazy and didn't feel like classic scooby doo to me. More like a useless film, i didn't feel any emotion or caring about the characters"
SCOOB!,47,54,audience,The funniest segment is the one where Scooby-Doo wins against the evil boss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SCOOB!,47,54,audience,"Although I am a big fan of Zac Efron and Mark Wahlberg. I cannot believe they didn't cast Matthew Lillard as Shaggy! MATTHEW LILLARD IS SHAGGY! He has been the best shaggy since the cartoon was made, perfect voice for the character. Bad move on that one. 
Matthew Lillard is the only shaggy."
SCOOB!,47,54,audience,"I had totally thought this movie was gonna be at least watchable as I have a real love for all the Hanna Barbera characters. Man was I wrong. This movie is AWFUL and I have no idea who it was supposed to appeal to. Do not be fooled like I was this movie is not worth your time. The voice acting is terrible. Shaggy and Scoob sound nothing like Shaggy and Scoob and it makes the movie completely unwatchable.
NOT WORTH THE WATCH AT ALL."
SCOOB!,47,54,audience,The best Scooby Doo iteration I've seen!
SCOOB!,47,54,audience,"It is not a good film. I feel like the team who made this were so gosh darn lazy! Why is this movie about superheroes?! Like why?! They even took the mask off twice because the villain is not in a costume! The villain is literally a supervillain and not a monster! They even went so stupidly far to when Scooby-Doo couldn't pronounce Dick Dastardly's name and ended up saying 'Rick?'. This just gave them an excuse for him to yell ""his first name"" on a children's movie! This movie is just so stupid and I could tell right from the beginning. Even though the beginning was cute, I could just tell. Maybe I am missing something about Dick Dastardly and maybe he is on something else but I still don't like this. The rest of the movie: Meh. I was hoping for an awesome, adventurous, action-packed, cute, mystery. Instead, I got a bad-paced, potty-talk, disappointing, bad, superhero movie."
SCOOB!,47,54,audience,I loved it! From Daphnie to Fred and the rest of the gang it was on point
SCOOB!,47,54,audience,"This is definitely a movie aimed for a really young audience, dialogue and characters tend to be silly and dumb. Nevertheless near to the of the movie, some heart is put into it avoiding becoming completely forgettable. One of the biggest problems for me is that main characters are not very well established, they are not fun or very relatable for most of the movie. I can't remember a joke that actually landed. Making the movie not very funny and in consequence not very fun. Overall the story is interesting, the problem is in the dialogue.

I just can't undertand how can a kids movie use Gerard Depardeu, and Simon Cowell jokes?  Kids don't know about them and the jokes are not that clever. Lazy writing!"
SCOOB!,47,54,audience,"Scooby-Doo! more like Scooby-Don't! ‘Scoob!', an animated film directed by Tony Cervone, is cute for the family but leaves little to be desired. Mystery has alway been at the heart of The Scooby franchise, and this new entry has none. None! Instead, we go on a ride with Mystery Inc.,  and cheap Hanna-Barbera cameos, to stop the already known villain rather than the classic whodunit that made Scooby so fun. Though Scooby is still adorable, his whole origin story was changed (which had little to do with advancing the plot) and the Mystery Gang spend little time together. If you are expecting a classic Scooby, this one wont suffice. Pass on this, because this Scooby Snacks are stale"
SCOOB!,47,54,audience,"Scoob! has great animation effects but that is probably the only thing that isn't wrong about this movie. The characters voices, as Velma's and Shaggy's ones, are disappointing and too uneven comparing to the cartoons. The plot is flat and fails in surprising, which is one of the best tricks of the original scooby doo movies. Also, the villains are not scary or worthy from a Scooby Doo movie. It lacks of supernatural elements and good characters."

Adam,90,,critic,"
Awfully low-key, to a degree that undercuts its final emotional impact. Still, the performances are solid, and the film conveys a strong sense of what it is like to be an independent woman ""without a man"" in the culture portrayed here...

Touzani has no time for throwing a pity party for these women, she shows instead that they deserve our admiration rather than our sympathy.

The Orphanage,93,90,audience,"The Orphanage is a stellar film conveying the need for true heartfelt cinematic experiences. Beautiful cinematography creates a transcendent movie experience, with a script based on the unpublished diaries of Anwar Hashim, who plays a supporting role in the film. Acclaimed director Shahrbanoo Sadat uses personal experiences to convey an uplifting message. 

Wolf and Sheep, the prequel to The Orphanage, premiered in 2016. Like its predecessor, The Orphanage is based on real life experiences in Afghanistan. The movie chronicles the main character, Qodrat (Qodratollah Qadiri), who spends his days trying to survive by illegally selling overpriced movie tickets and key rings. He is then brought to a Russian-operated orphanage along with other teenage boys, where he is given the opportunity to get an education alongside his peers. The Orphanage details his experiences in the orphanage and how the quarrels between roommates of the dorms are dealt with by the director Anwar (Anwar Hashimi). All throughout a war torn country in 1989, Qodrat remains hopeful, through fantasy sequences shared with the audience. 

The cinematography is what truly stands out in this film. Directory of photography, Virginie Surdej captures the beauty of the country while adding to the heartbreaking story. My favorite part of this movie is the performances by the young people, including Qodratollah Qadiri, who gives rare insight into real life in Afghanistan, as they are all natives of the country. 

The message of this film is about the importance of hope, despite all circumstances. The protagonist, Qodrat, remains hopeful and looks for positive routes of escapism throughout his struggles of growing up without a family, and his struggles at the orphanage. You should be aware that the film contains strong language and minor adult content. There are also two graphic descriptions of war and violence. There is also some references to sex and pornographic images (very far away from the screen, but still visible) that are unsuitable for younger kids.  

I give The Orphanage 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 15 to 18, plus adults.  Reviewed by Erin M., KIDS FIRST!"
The Orphanage,93,90,audience,"Based upon a set of unpublished diaries by Anwar Hashimi (who delivers a great supporting role in the film) split into a 'pentalogy' - revealed by Google to be ""compound literary or narrative work explicitly divided into five parts"". 'The Orphanage' is the second part of this planned five-part series. We are invited into the life journey of a a teenager living in Afghanistan named Qodrat, observing moments of their upbringing within a community orphanage. Qadrat is a fan of Bollywood cinema, brilliantly showcased through his moments of daydreaming framed within a musical lens. A prime example encountered early on is his attraction to a girl sitting nearby in the same class, which culminates in a romantic singalong piece featuring colourful attire where they both run into each others arms on a luxurious beach, interspersed with upbeat music and close-up shots of the sun. These sections of musical satire were thoroughly entertaining (a la 'Flight of the Concords') whilst providing added depth as a sincere love letter to Bollywood cinema, alongside the power that film and imagination can provide for nourishing the soul. Palpable tension comes from a set of characters ruling the internal hierarchy by bullying others in the orphanage, running in smart parallel to the backdrop of volatile international politics played out during the course of the film. Its portrayal of the Soviet Union providing Russian language education and childhood pioneer camps within Afghanistan were revealing nuggets of history. It manages to capture honest glimpses of youthful connection, uncertainty and amusement, reminiscent of 'Stand By Me' to a degree - yet manages to retain a unique sense of identity, feeling very much its own piece. Boasting an incredible ability to jump from social realism (akin to the work of Ken Loach) towards surrealist escapism at the drop of a (musical) hat, without feeling forced or trite. The engrossing story-line ratchets up the underlying tension and energy as it progresses onward, resulting in a gripping finale. Various emotions are explored throughout, where even the humorous musical segments are laced with a bittersweet concoction of paradise and pathos. An all-encompassing film from director Sharhbanoo Sadat, which left such a strong impression that I am seeking Sadat's 2016 prequel (and first part of the planned five-series) 'Wolf and Sheep' as a matter of urgency."
The Orphanage,93,90,audience,"Written and directed by black British director Shahrbanoo Sadat, with mostly Danish finance, and showing on MUBI now, this is the second time she has based her film on the unpublished diaries of Anwar Hashimi who grew up in Afghanistan back in the 80s and acts as a sequel/continuation, to her previous Wolf and Sheep in 2016, which centred on a young boy named Qodrat played by Quodratollah Qadiri. He returns here as Qodrat again, now a Bollywood obsessed teenager who's sent to an orphanage after he was caught scalping cinema tickets. There he meets other kids, some he befriends, some were bullies, and these interactions contribute to make up the bulk of the film's somewhat episodic but interwoven narrative that's part historical document and part personal memoir. Neorealistic in style, using amateur actors in the main roles (even Hashimi joins in as the kind-hearted supervisor, called Anwar naturally) and shot on location, the film uses the intimate and sweet stories based on their experiences at the orphanage to reflect and explore their native Afghan culture and the precarious nature of living in a country torn between extreme religious fanatics and Soviet indoctrination. The acting and directing style are purely naturalistic, except for the three fantasy interludes which turn Quodrat's inner emotions into Bollywood musical numbers. While some might find this jarring, others might be more enchanted by this ode to Bollywood cinema – which will in turn determine how one feels about the enigmatic, bittersweet note on which the film ends on. At least, you have to admire its consistency and passion and the film has an irresistible artistic sheen and charm to it. The result is gently illuminating and thoughtful and could conceivably see Sadat and Qadiri be the Truffaut and Doniel of Afghan cinema."

Amid the missteps, the care the filmmaker has for this story prevails.

My Darling Supermarket,88,,audience,"This quirky documentary about the lives and outlooks of employees at a Brazilian supermarket examines their unexpectedly profound insights about life and existence, views that they freely share with co-workers, customers and the film crew during their daily work routines. As intriguing as those ideas are, though, they run their course rather quickly and begin to stretch the credibility of the narrative somewhat, especially given the number of employees holding such perspectives and their eagerness to share them. And, considering that much of the remainder of this release consists of lengthy depictions of routine tasks, like stocking shelves and baking bread, the content becomes rather mundane and redundant after a while, no matter how artfully these activities are filmed. Director Tali Yankelevich's off-beat documentary demonstrates that even ordinary subjects can generate some unexpected interest, but it also shows that it only goes so far before the juice runs out (and I'm not talking the kind found in Aisle 6)."

Test Pattern,95,60,audience,Oh look. I just wasted 90 minutes of my life for nothing. Awful with no conclusion.
Test Pattern,95,60,audience,"All they had to do was call Benson at SVU.

This is amateur filmmaker Shatara Michelle Ford's first full-length feature film as writer, producer and director, with only one prior short film on her resume.

As a new filmmaker, she certainly shows promise. And I'm (surprisingly) happy for her that the critics all raved about this film, however, I don't know why. Some comments from them on Rotten Tomatoes bring in gender, race, health system, etc. into discussion. I didn't see any of that here. All I saw was a flawed story with an obvious and much simpler alternate solution to the problem.

For starters, the plot has ridiculous holes in it. This entire film is based on a ""question mark"", of why wouldn't they just contact the police from the start, and have SVU do everything they for some reason decided to do on their own. There was zero purpose in getting that test done unless the authorities got involved, and they should have right from the start. The fact she didn't want them involved, only suggests consent, and her simp boyfriend maybe even did pick up on that, when he finally showed he had his own voice. Now if there were racial issues when the police showed up and procedure wasn't followed, then we have a realistic movie. But to make one with illogical scenarios and implausible reasoning, doesn't make a good story.

Even the dynamics between the two were ridiculous. Again, let's assume the guy is a total simp after he finds out what happens (no spoilers), what was the reasoning behind her being such an ungrateful b!tch and treating him like crap, as if he was to blame for all of this, especially when the guy was ridiculously and unrealistically that supportive and understanding? And why weren't either of them mad at her friend for allowing any of this to get that out of hand. I get that such freinds do exist, but how you treat them after was once again, unrealistic.

Then to drag this unrealistic story out for a normally-comfortable 82 minutes, with it's snail's pacing and long dragged out and unnecessary scenes - that made it feel 2+ hours, I question if the critics saw the same film I did. The constant pointless long freeze-frame and zero-dialogue scenes became annoying and boring very quick. Then there was the zero to loud obnoxious random score - even getting some circus music in there, made me shake my head many times. Even the performances were flat, boring, and unconvincing. I'm sure part blame is Ford's inexperience to direct her cast effectively.

I really can't suggest any reason to watch this one, except to support an upcoming new filmmaker - without any expectations of seeing anything substantial. It's a generous 5/10 from me, most if it going towards a ""great first effort"" ribbon, instead towards the filmmaking quality of the production."

The Pink Cloud, a movie written some 1,100 days before the pandemic, ironically became a way for me to process so much of what happened in 2020.
 "
The Pink Cloud,100,,critic,"
Under unexpected scrutiny from an audience with a newfound connection to the problems presented, Gerbase's narrative holds up quite well.
 "
The Pink Cloud,100,,critic,"
Yet the film captures more than the oppressive boredom and listlessness that an extended quarantine entails, as the cloud itself makes a striking allegory for the imposition of traditional tenets of femininity in conventional heterosexual relationships.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
One for the Road tells a romantic and dreamlike story seeped in personal nostalgia that seems to exist in its own rose-colored world.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
There is no easy way to say goodbye. Herein lies the film's greatest strength: the yearning it creates, finds, or resurrects in you for connection and reconciliation.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
Mr. Poonpiriya probably fancies the film as some breezy road movie, but what transpires is theater of cruelty on par with Neil LaBute's ""In the Company of Men.""
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
On this travelogue, the trip to Chiang Mai alone is worth the gas money.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
Director Poonpiriya and [the film's] co-writers have created one of the most beautiful and heartfelt road movies. One for the Road is a celebration of life that's also incredibly emotional.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
A compelling road trip movie [centered around] love and regret, friendship and forgiveness.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
[A] broad and mostly formulaic buddy dramedy.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
The resulting film is a convoluted mess. A soap opera that deteriorates with every ensuing sequence.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
One for the Road, though it has some narrative shortcomings, especially in the second half of the movie, proves further that Baz Poonpiriya is one the most exciting Asian filmmakers working today.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
One for the Road takes the audience on a satisfying journey, with a few too many bumps and detours along the way.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
If you were in a bar with Baz Poonpiriya, his idea of just one more for the road would probably take you through until the milkman did his rounds in the morning - he just can't resist adding shot after shot to this shaggy dog road trip about two friends.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
Beyond its excessive length (136 minutes), my main gripe is how on-the-nose the film is.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
Poonpiriya's third feature undoubtedly feels like a filmmaker at a crossroads.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
One for the Road reminds us that there's a difference between surviving and living, and is easy to look at while it does so.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
One for the Road is a terrific film that reminds us that life is coloured by death, which can make everything seem urgent, but leaves you comforted by its lesson that while there's a time to mourn, there must also be celebration.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
Although One for the Road is a long movie with many storylines, it culminates in a discovery at the end of the road that makes it all worth it.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
While Poonpiriya's film seems to hit the nail on the head a little too often, he builds a strong case as a director to watch in the future.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
Drags out the conflict between two generally unlikable, thinly sketched bar bros to an unconscionable 136 minutes.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
This is very ardently a young man's picture, full of unreflective nostalgia and self-mythologizing grandeur. As an old fart, my heart went out to it.
 "
One for the Road,65,,critic,"
Unfortunately the last hour really pulls it down with a story change that drags.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
Camilleri has found a real discovery in his lead actor.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
""Luzzu"" is the kind of film Roberto Rossellini would have made if he were still alive today
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
An authentic and affecting depiction of an ordinary man struggling to exist in a modern and corrupt world.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
Many films aspire to be 'slice-of-life,' but Alex Camilleri's Luzzu truly is the real deal, aided by a brilliantly internalised performance from non-professional actor Jesmark Scicluna.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
A ravishing portrait of tradition in transition, Luzzu brings Malta to the forefront.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
A brilliant exercise on verité that perfectly balances the calmness of summer waves and the brutality of life.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
Luzzu has been distinctively gripping throughout, then the climax arrives and it grows into something impactful and lingering.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
It all culminates in a moving, gripping and often-heartbreakingly real tale.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
[An] immersive plunge into the crushing reality of being a fisherman in Malta.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
Director Alex Camilleri paints a somber tale of tradition being slowly snuffed out by the unstoppable march of progress. Its languid pace and may not work for all viewers, but there's a mournful sort of beauty here, if you're willing to look for it.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
An honest, affecting slab of working-class portraiture, altogether bracing with its thorny labor politics and salty sea air.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
It's a heartbreaking, but clear-eyed look at the last gasp of a dying industry, and a man whose whole identity, whole livelihood gets shattered by a force beyond his comprehension.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
A poignant and stirring look at a way of life that is slowly and inevitably being eclipsed by the passage of time and those who end up getting caught in the middle of those changes.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
The film is scripted dramatic fiction, but no less true for that.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
Luzzu is a slender, rather bleak but tough, rough-cut little jewel that deserves your time and attention.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
The conclusion of LUZZU is profoundly sad but caps off a story told with skill, beauty, and resonance far beyond the shores of Malta.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
It's thoughtfully directed without being showy, the matter-of-fact presentation hammering home how such sad stories are everyday occurrences.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
The impressive feature debut from Maltese-American writer and director Alex Camilleri manages to be both self-contained, in its depiction of an embattled community, but also unexpectedly far-reaching in its themes.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
This is a clear-eyed view of the choices Jesmark and those like him are facing, showing just how complex the situation is, cutting beyond work to community and culture.
 "
Luzzu,100,,critic,"
The dramatic arc of ""Luzzu"" is slight, with Camilleri more interested in people and place than telling a captivating story. But Jesmark Scicluna makes the film compelling nonetheless...
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
A fantastic cinematic expression of issues facing many women today, and it feels so good to see a film about a strong female challenging the status quo by pushing back on her society's traditional gender roles.
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
Based on true events, this film is a character-driven story with a raw look of being a woman in a patriarchal society.
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
The antithesis to the other big winner at this year's [Sundance Film] festival, the tear-jerking and crowd-pleasing CODA, for its subtle and quieter tone.
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
Very simple grassroots-looking filmmaking makes what's on view all the more realistic. A fact-based allegory guaranteed to inspire.
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
The film is stirring, infuriating, and ultimately hopeful.
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
Hive builds a strong storyline around the self-reliance and determination of an uneducated country woman, played with glammed-down but riveting cool by a granite-faced Yllka Gashi.
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
Its specific cultural backdrop keeps it mostly enthralling. You've seen this, but surely not from the Kosovan lens.
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
If a little light on dramatic punch and arguably straight-forward to a fault, Hive sustains interest thanks largely to Yllka Gashi's transfixing performance.
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
First-time writer-director Blerta Basholli's feature is an expertly crafted, compassionate testament to the perseverance and defiance of its courageous female collective.
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
""Hive"" is about the hard-won rewards of resilience, but there's a sting...
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
Although, like its main character, Hive is more on the low-key and pensive side, it is nonetheless a gut-punching and measured film.
 "
Hive,100,,critic,"
Blerta Basholli's calmly composed handling of an emotionally-charged true story makes for an outstanding debut feature in Hive.
 "
Fire in the Mountains,100,,critic,"
Fire in the Mountains is a strangely compelling tale that thrives in its interpretive nature.
 "
Fire in the Mountains,100,,critic,"
A mix of heavenly landscapes and desperate lives, Ajitpal Singh's debut feature is like if Apu in Pather Panchali had TikTok...
 "
Fire in the Mountains,100,,critic,"
As a result, this story is of a reactive India rather than an original one - a recognition of the fated, not the isolated. After all, a fire in the mountains is often defined by how fast it spreads...
 "
Fire in the Mountains,100,,critic,"
Through the snapshot of one family, struggling to stay afloat, director Ajitpal Singh constructs a strident critique of globalized India...
 "
Fire in the Mountains,100,,critic,"
[Singh] abstains from making any conclusions, but what he does present is a strong indictment.
 "
Fire in the Mountains,100,,critic,"
Singh drives home his point that the conundrum of cultural and ideological clashes is itself is the plight of India's rural classes.
 "
Fire in the Mountains,100,,critic,"
Fire in the Mountains is a heartfelt endeavor to connect moviegoers with the grander scope of the world.
 "
Fire in the Mountains,100,,critic,"
""Fire in the Mountains"" is a conventional tale that pits progressive ideals against tradition. But what makes it work is Singh's resolve to avoid miserablism and remain nonjudgmental throughout...
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Clint Bentley's minor-key melodrama about an aging horseman that's as quietly earthy as it is emotionally shattering.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
This is a passionate understated performance, sharp and focused, with eyes on the prize.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
This revealing look at an enigmatic sports profession gives Collins a chance to shine -- and he is brilliant.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
An evocative study of American life on the fringes that unfolds alongside the grand mysticism of stallions. Clifton Collins Jr. delivers a haunting, profoundly poignant performance.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
There is a wonderful celebratory sequence between Collins and Parker that shows what the film could have and should have been, had they been the sole focus.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
'Jockey' proves Clifton Collins Jr. is so much more than a supporting player specialist, as the successes of Clint Bentley's moving drama can largely be attributed to Collins Jr.'s award-worthy performance.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Unapologetically straight-forward but agreeably understated, this rewarding drama affords a long-deserving lead role to veteran character actor Clifton Collins Jr., who unequivocally rises to the occasion.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
The trouble is that this film from debuting director Clint Bentley proves to be little more than a rehash of The Wrestler with horses instead of body slams. The end result is competent, but forgettable.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Bentley's effort offers an authentic and vulnerable exploration of the athletes at the bottom of the horse racing ecosystem.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Clifton Collins Jr. truly shines.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Collins embodies the bone-weary struggles of an aging athlete, when there's more track behind him than in front, in a performance that is spare and graceful.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Clifton Collins, Jr. embodies this defiant, determined, sorrowful man with such grace that the picture draws you in.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
You've certainly seen [actor Clifton Collins Jr.] before, but never quite like this.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Movies don't need to telly wholly original stories every time. Jockey certainly doesn't, however it presents two wonderful actors - Collins and Parker - with a showcase for their talent. And for that it's worth watching.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Bentley's intimate character study shows a man coming to terms with his vulnerability, resting on a career-best performance from Clifton Collins Jr, who navigates the role of athlete and father with subtle but striking conviction.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Jockey has a great performance from Clifton Collins Jr. at its core. He gives the film its heart and its soul.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Jockey is a modest, intimate film, to be sure, but an impressively assured one. It finds a lovely, low-key groove early on and maintains it, and draws performances from its key players that are terrific and true.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Filmed at an actual Arizona racetrack with real jockeys filling in the details, Jockey takes the winner's purse in authenticity.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Very understated and simple... random but beautiful.
 "
Jockey,96,,critic,"
Bentley's film wins by virtue of Collins Jr.'s soulful performance, exploring a man coming to terms with his own expiration clock and trying to come to peace with his legacy.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
Wang's film sheds light on the culture of disinformation, the pursuit of power, and injury of trauma left in the wake of this international tragedy.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
Outstanding director Nanfu Wang was prescient enough to send a covert team of cameras into hospitals, homes, and morgues to capture the truth and anguish, then follow the virus-and the bungling cover-up-across the sea to America.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
Like in Wang's first film, Hooligan Sparrow, In the Same Breath relies on exciting cloak-and-dagger reporting as she goes undercover, away from government watchdogs.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
""In the Same Breath"" succeeds only as a bracing critique of Chinese censorship, because it spectacularly fails as a documentary on its purported subject, Covid-19.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
Wang's portrait is a clarion call for transparency in the face of an international crisis.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
The result is a chilling, truly absorbing film with big implications for the future.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
As infuriating as it is important. Nobody is doing it like Nanfu Wang.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
A brave and important movie for the world to see
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
Nanfu Wang lets the men and women of Wuhan regain some narrative control, allowing them to relay their experiences before, during and after the 76-day lockdown to uncover the truth beyond the propaganda.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
The film comes from a place of authenticity and candor, and like any good cross-examination of the truth, will make you want to ask even more questions. In the Same Breath certainly feels like the COVID-19 documentary that the world needs to see.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
This is essential viewing, most particularly for those who have doubted, questioned or downplayed Covid-19.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
Wang blows the whistle once more with a typically probing examination of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
A scathing indictment of both the U.S. and China in relation to their official responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
Moving between the public and the classified, [director Nanfu Wang] elevates the piece with heartbreaking testimony from American nurses on the front line.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
""In the Same Breath"" is a fervent work of reporting, filled with shocking revelations on both a close-up, experiential level and on the level of overarching statistics and trends.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
A film that presents frontline journalism through an intensely personal perspective and, along with the recent 76 Days, will almost certainly go down as a key cinematic record of the early days of Covid-19 and how it all went so terribly wrong.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
In the Same Breath starts the conversation with sweeping scope, exceptional perspective and an inescapable reckoning with the truth.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
It's when we are in the heart of the tragedy that the movie works best, the pain of interview after interview accumulating in intensity
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
Through her careful direction, [Nanfu] Wang brings a first-hand perspective in her brutally honest documentary. Daring to defy the sceptics, In the Same Breath is unrestrained, powerful and essential viewing.
 "
In the Same Breath,97,,critic,"
This work will stand as one of the greater documents of these life-altering times.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
While its atmospheric direction and finely tuned craftsmanship impress, Human Factors is far too passive in its storytelling approach to deliver an engaging experience.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
Under overcast skies and rainy weather, the noirish family drama plays out like a thriller, where each family member has a secret.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
Keeps things interesting with a simple gimmick, but ultimately too full of red herrings.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
Keeps you guessing until the final shot
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
Instead of a ""Rashomon"" effect meant to muddy a single truth, ""Human Factor"" illustrates four co-equal truths too afraid of each other to compare notes.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
Part mystery, part drama, it's both engaging and sobering.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
An utterly intelligent thriller.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
While Human Factors is a fascinating experiment in non-linear storytelling, it's a routine portrait of a fragmenting family.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
Human Factors does a remarkable job illustrating how fragile the familial ecosystem can be, even in seemingly the strongest families.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
Human Factors keeps threatening to tilt in a genuinely provocative direction-is it really about anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe? Is it an Östlund-style probing of male cowardice?-only to drop the thread.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
A challenging and very well considered inspection of familial disintegration, featuring strong performances, Human Factors is a solid entry in the Sundance World Cinema Dramatic Competition.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
As Human Factors progresses, what starts as an originally interesting study of how kaleidoscopic are human perceptions, ends up as a lukewarm portrait of crumbling relationships.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
Slight to a fault, Human Factors never reconciles its duelling aspirations into a gratifying whole, despite solid performances from its leads.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
Its early set-up might hobble it in the beginning, but those who know what they're getting into will likely have an alright time with the story.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
A tense mix of family dynamics story, psychological thriller and whodunit Human Factors succeeds at all the genres it tackles. This is engrossing and tension filled storytelling. You won't be able to look away.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
Human Factors gets a lot of things right.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
At first nothing adds up until we realize Human Factors is perhaps crystal clear, the obvious answers to all our questions and theirs lurking in the unhappy sentiments of people who prefer to brush everything under the rug for all the wrong reasons.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
A brutally tense yet restrained look at the unspoken ruptures within idealised upper-middle-class life, and how the littlest details give way to breaches that don't need to be reached through an all-consuming calamity.
 "
Human Factors,63,,critic,"
This deviously constructed puzzle film plays cat and mouse (or to be exact, pet rat) with the viewer, yields subtly disconcerting insights into the fault lines of bourgeois life, and features terrific lead performances...
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
The sincere and angry film marks the inspired directorial debut of Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
A strong debut with a remarkable performance by Michael Greyeyes that delves on complex themes that are rarely explored on screen. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
WILD INDIAN is a Native film that refuses to bow to Colonial power and rips that power from the Colonizers fear paralyzed hands and says, ""No more.""
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
Wild Indian pulsates with well-calibrated tension and a rare kind of vitality in its shrewd examination of today through the eyes of history.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
A shockingly intense, disturbing character study from a promising and talented filmmaker.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
Brilliant, emotional, dark, brutal, Wild Indian absolutely blew my mind and is a film that will stick with you long after watching it. The parallels between our two main characters are utterly haunting and fascinating.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
Here we have a protagonist who viciously murders a schoolmate, feels nothing about his crime, and then grows into an even more loathsome adult who never really gets his due.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
Corbine Jr.'s debut is a lean, disconcerting and impressively shot character study. Hovering on a glimmering knife edge, there are flashes of brilliance here.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
Wild Indian is a compelling thriller about a Native American who has essentially rebuilt his life in order to move beyond his past.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
A lean script alert to character and nuance, and Corbine's taut direction, showcase the range and talent of Greyeyes, whose star rises.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
[Corbine's] vision is bold, confidently going to places that are dark and unconventional, with a masterful cinematic language often only found in the works of a seasoned filmmaker.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
No one involved comes through unscathed, including the viewer, but it opens a window to understand the pain that's been inflicted on indigenous peoples. It's a positive step for anyone willing to take it.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
Corbine gets caught up trying to cover the narrative ground, to set up both characters in twin time periods and explore their motivations and relationship.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
Director-writer Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr. creates a spare storyline that serves as a clothesline onto which he hangs his observations about modern Native Americans, those who stay on the reservation and those who flee from it.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
Like the Cain and Abel story a priest shares early in the film, Wild Indian weaves a narrative around resentment of twinned and intertwined destinies.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
'Wild Indian' is a dark cinematic dance that explores the harsh effects of colonization that are still evident in modern Native communities.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
What keeps such pro forma plotting interesting - insofar as it can be considered interesting - is the film's refusal to moralize.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
A story with ideas as big as these on its mind sometimes requires metaphors to make sense of them.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
A fractured character study of a man who, despite years of trying, cannot escape his past.
 "
Wild Indian,82,,critic,"
Raises interesting ideas about grief, guilt, and responsibility, all while shedding light on the ongoing struggles of Indigenous people in America.
 "
Rocks,97,83,audience,"Gavron’s direction just envelops you into Rocks’ world, you feel like you’re right there with her. It felt real, authentic and true without veering into stereotypical ‘British film’ grimness. Brilliant. Give it many awards."
Rocks,97,83,audience,"As tender, gentle yet still powerful a film as you're likely to come across. A cast of mostly first time actors tell the story of a girl and her young brother trying to make it work after their mother walks out, leaving them alone. The film is perfectly cast, each performer giving portrayals of such subtle truth that it's hard to look away from. The film is never worthy or sentimental, and it's also often as funny as it is moving. It reminds me in places of Girlhood, which is high praise for me; though stylistically it's somewhat different and doesn't deal with gangs at all. It's refreshing and significant that this film portrays young black women as rounded people; never sexualised, not having violence committed against by men; struggling but also forging their own paths and doing all that lies within their power to do. We need many more films like this."
Rocks,97,83,audience,"Brilliant, original and important"
Rocks,97,83,audience,beautiful coming of age story from a traditionally untold perspective 
Rocks,97,83,audience,"Director Sarah Gavron (2015's 'Sufragette') intended to craft 'Rocks' as a truly realistic slice of life depicting the experience of living in the black communities of suburban London, in the most authentic way possible, and the result is impeccable. We take in every little aspect of the excruciating, beautiful and unpredictable rhythm of life through the eyes of a teenage girl whose mother leaves her to take care of her younger brother by herself.
Gavron's teenage cast is composed almost only of non-actors, she films exclusively on location with a handheld camera, so the influence of Italian neo-realism is there, in all the best ways possible, especially because the film is also directed to be funny and accessible, albeit sometimes intentionally hard to watch and always emotionally resonant."
Rocks,97,83,audience,"Maybe it's because watching a bunch of teenager girls talk over each other isn't normally my idea of entertainment, I've steered clear of this critically well-received film that has landed in many's Top 10 list last year. However, I'm glad to have caught up on it now on Netflix, and the girls' overlapping dialogue turns out not as disagreeable as I had initially anticipated. Story-wise, this reminds me of (the better) Capernaum; though Hackney can't compare with Beirut in terms of exoticness, Helene Louvart's cinematography makes a good stab in capturing the Council-chic side of London. Shola/""Rocks"" is a Nigerian-Jamaican schoolgirl whose single mother has decided to take an indefinite break leaving behind a note, a few quid and a younger brother for her to take care of; but this is less about how she copes and dodges Social Services as it's about the bond within the sisterhood of her close school-mates, a melting pot of different cultural backgrounds and shades of skin colours. Directed by Sarah Gavron, whose last film, the star-studded Suffragette, is the complete opposite of this, her indie-spirited collaboration with writers Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson and a cast of young and fresh-faced first-timers benefits from their naturalism and the cliche-free Loachian approach they've adapted which never panders or patronises. Performances from Bukky Bakray and D'angelou Osei Kissiedu, as the abandoned siblings, are cheeky, heartbreaking and entirely convincing without being over-saccahrine or irksome, even when they are making mistakes that you're desperately willing them not to. Admittedly, the film took a while for me to get into but it ends up being surprisingly engaging and even though I still don't consider a bunch of teenage girls giggling and gabbing my idea of cinematic fun, next time I'll try to be more open-minded about it."
Rocks,97,83,audience,"A very real, fresh account of hardship being overcome by a teenage girl, with the support of her tightknit friendship group. Bakray's and Ali's characters' relationship is strong, and the actresses performances really make that an effortless display. The whole thing feels very real, and raw. The emotions are inline with the age group and the situations, as well as some of the carnage that ensues. Whilst a serious and sometimes harrowing account of what life can be like for some of our youth, it also provides some comedy and moments to make you smile. Really well done by the powerhouse of young ladies who deliver this so brilliantly"
Rocks,97,83,audience,"Dysfunctional family, no father, mother leaves, cute boy looked after by sister. Feral schoolchildren, hard-pressed teachers, no future, no prospects. It's been done so many, many times and done so much better."
Rocks,97,83,audience,Words cannot convey the raw emotion and absolute realism of this film.  The teenage lead and her brother perform with acting masterclass that belies their age and experience.  Nothing about this feels forced or contrived as we see the joyful lives of teenage girls and the issues many in the social care system suffer through daily.  Despite its subject matter the film manages to inspire hope for the future if we can just hold on.   A MUST WATCH.
Rocks,97,83,audience,"This is the first phenomenal British film I've seen in a while, the child actors are brilliant in this. it made me cry, smile and laugh . I recommend everyone of all ages to watch this."
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
Authentic, small, and deeply humane
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
If you've lived in a city, you've seen these girls; you've been these girls. You can't help but feel the warmth of nostalgia as you watch Rocks and her friends trying to find the joy in a world that is so often against them.
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
The hope that remains at the end of the film may be tinged with melancholy and a need for acceptance, but it remains, like Rocks, steadfast and believable.
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
A compassionate, finely observed portrait of a young woman's gradual breaking down, as the usual buffers, including brotherly love and friendships, strain under her crushing responsibility.
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
There are some moments where the group of working-class girls seem genuine and honest. At other times, the film is a bit dull and takes on the character of a middle-class morality tale, almost a cinematic finger-wagging.
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
Raw, heartbreaking and fresh.
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
Teeming with an infectious effervescence, the adolescent coming-of-age drama ""Rocks"" differentiates itself from other recent explorations of modern girlhood set amid immigrant communities.
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
It's not always a smooth ride, but it's richly humane.
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
The cast led by Bukky Bakray and Kosar Ali are unbelievably charming and infectious. In a just world, these rockstars would become household names.
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
There isn't a false note.
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"
Rocks is an exceptional film that is equally beautiful and heart-wrenching without ever feeling manipulative.
 "
Rocks,97,83,critic,"

Ailey,86,,critic,"
As a result, it feels immediately hollow. Who is this nebulous voice, more seen than heard, that bears the film's name?
 "
Ailey,86,,critic,"
Director Jamilla Wignot's film gives voice to the silent protest in Ailey's heart that did not have an audience...

Ailey,86,,critic,"
Wignot masterfully weaves the present with the past in a way that causes her movie to surge with urgency.
 "
Ailey,86,,critic,"
This intriguing if incomplete biographical documentary only scratches the surface of its subject's clear genius.
 "
Ailey,86,,critic,"
The attention paid to the individual dances is thoughtful and close.
 "
Ailey,86,,critic,"
Often, Wignot's portrait privileges Ailey the icon at the expense of Alvin the man, leaving me to wonder: What insights about such a singular figure might the film have been able to reveal were it less invested in careful editing?
 "
Ailey,86,,critic,"
'Ailey' works to chronicle the rise off a legend while also documenting the hardships of performing in the US from the 1950s onward.
 "
Ailey,86,,critic,"
Ailey has a clear love for dance and the American master it focuses on, but it has a hard time passing along a vocabulary for that passion.

A reverent and galvanizing film celebrating dance that's a reflection of black life created by a pioneer.

Ailey is an 'important' documentary as it serves as an essential chapter in understanding black history and how dance played such a big hand in visioning the present scenarios with the transformative power that the art represents.
 "
Ailey,86,,critic,"
Not only did Wignot get access to the company's archives, she also brings her camera into its rehearsal space, following the troupe in the act of creation.
 "
Ailey,86,,critic,"
No matter though since by the time we get there we have seen so much of Ailey's choreography in archival footage. We've been lifted by it and understood the enormity of his talent and legacy.

""Ailey"" creates a feeling about Alvin Ailey: how grace and eloquence, fire and obsession merged within him.
 "
Ailey,86,,critic,"
Alvin Ailey sacrificed the pain, joy, and memorable moments of his life as a tapestry for his dance genius that lives with us always captured in a layered, emotional doc by Jamila Wignot
 "
Ailey,86,,critic,"
Jamila Wignot's extraordinarily moving documentary on Black dance pioneer Alvin Ailey devotes as much screen time to the choreographer's breathtaking stage works as to the reflections from friends, collaborators, dancers and artistic directors.

Softie is a compelling act of defiance, made more alarming by the violent events documented throughout the film, including the torture and murder of an official charged with keeping the elections fair and safe.

With the compelling performance of Natasa Stork as Márta who is in every scene until very late in the film and with Róbert Maly's superb cinematography relying heavily on close-ups, it's challenging and tantalizing to decide how much really occurs.

The dramatic layers of what we know is coming color every action with as much danger as melancholy since Mouaness [shows us a] Lebanon [about to be] irrevocably changed.
 "
1982,92,,critic,"
In 1982 Mouaness is thoughtfully considering the ways that, even in times of macro-sized conflicts and crisis, life goes on, unbent and broken, and petty and silly.
 "
1982,92,,critic,"
Mouaness sustains this momentum for much of the second half, riding along the crest of a high-tension early-release day with a logjam of buses and parents outside, unreliable attendance sheets, and the school secretary working the phones like a champ.

Blizzard of Souls,73,,audience,"A cinematic masterpiece and the Oscar submission from the Baltic nation of Latvia, Blizzard of Souls will take you through a rollercoaster of emotions while providing you with a thorough history lesson! With echoes of 1917, Blizzard of Souls has masterful editing and cinematography, incredible sets and locations, and a talented cast, but falls a bit short on explaining major events in the First World War. 

KULTFILMA took inspiration from true events and the novel by Grins to create Blizzard of Souls, which follows a teenage boy named Arturs Vanags in Russian-controlled Latvia (around the 1910s). Arturs' father was a highly decorated commander of a regiment of the Latvian army, and his brother Edgars is focused on carrying on that legacy. He's not exactly a fighter, but when his mother is killed by the Germans, Arturs, his brother, and his father conscript in the national Latvian Riflemen battalions of the Imperial Russian army in hopes of getting revenge and finding glory. He experiences many loves and losses in battle, after which he, among other soldiers, grows weary of the Tsarist cause and feels forgotten. Arturs must decide whether to stay with his regiment or defect and join his comrades in fighting the Latvian War of Independence and start his life all over again. As you can see, there's a lot happening in the film, and it's an intriguing plotline. Though I am a history buff, I'm not at the top of my game when it comes to Latvian war history, so I was really hoping for some time or battle markers; all of the battles seemed to blend together, save for the final conflict Arturs is involved in - the Battle of Cesis. 

The cast and crew shine in this Baltic beauty. Oto Brantevics and Raimonds Celms play the brothers Vanags, with Oto as Arturs and Raimonds as Edgars. Raimond is a more experienced actor, but Oto really shines in his performance, with perfectly toned emotions and dialogue. Their on-screen father is played by Martins Vilsons, whose cerebral, tough personality gives way (at the perfect time) to paternal love. And the Vanags' friends in the film, Mikelsons and Konrads, are played by Jēkabs Reinis and Gatis Gaga, who excel in their supporting roles with pointed humor and emulating the characters' focused, yet free personalities. Behind the scenes, Dzintars Dreibergs directed the film meticulously, with a keen eye on historical accuracy and believability. The music in the film, which majestically introduces and drives the action in each scene, was composed by Lolita Ritmanis. The soundtrack is definitely one of my favorite parts of the film. Another beautiful element of Blizzard of Souls is the cinematography by Valdis Celmiņš; viewers can tell that each shot was thoughtfully planned out. There is a large part of one battle sequence that was shot and edited in one take, which really helps the speed of the film. 

The message of Blizzard of Souls is one of growth; Arturs grows from a young boy to a mature hero throughout this film and has to make many tough decisions along the way. It's a positive and relatable message, as we all grow as people throughout our lives. There are some scenes for parents to watch out for though; there's a lot of blood and gore, some nudity and profanity (given the culture of trench warfare). 

I give Blizzard of Souls 5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 14 to 18. Adults will enjoy this film as well."
Blizzard of Souls,73,,audience,Amazing! So personal and respectful war story. Just must see! If this is not getting Oscars then I dont know movies.
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
Strip away the national trappings and this is an old, old story, but director Dzintars Dreibergs, despite working with a tiny budget, tells it well.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
It's a cliché in the truest sense, taking the façade of a rousing Spielbergian drama with none of its spirit, and the ethereal visual design of a Malick film with none of its ardor.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
An aggressively stirring account of a nation painfully enduring catastrophic conflict as prelude to independence.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
Despite minor hang-ups, Blizzard of Souls is a great war movie with a story that needs to be shared.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
A very powerful film made on a particularly small budget.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
A first narrative feature by documentarian Dzintars Dreibergs, Blizzard is handsome, well-acted, and expansively produced.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
A movie with plenty of small portions that communicate thought-provoking ideas and gripping melees but without a substantial human anchor.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
It's a grim, mostly unheroic story about the Great War, told from a perspective that is mostly ignored by history.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
Its good-taste approach to warfare, along with its treacly music score by Lolita Ritmanis, underscores what seems its main reason for being: a relentless ""Go, Latvia!"" agenda...
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
A naïve teenager comes of age amid the carnage of World War I's Eastern Front in this propulsive adaptation of Aleksandrs Grins' 1934 patriotic classic ""Blizzard of Souls.""
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
The filmmakers are unafraid of the picturesque, lighting scenes so they resemble old-master canvases.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
A wartime drama told at a distance, lacking the personality and human stakes that give the best conflict films their extraordinary power, even amid its impressive battlefield set pieces.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
One of the best war films of the last few years.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
Blizzard of Souls, the 1934 novel from which this is drawn, is based on author Aleksandrs Grīns' own frontline experiences, and The Rifleman successfully captures the hazy, gauzy quality of memory.
 "
Blizzard of Souls,73,,critic,"
Dreibergs, known up to now for his sports documentaries, directs with a great deal of male force and gusto.

Sylvie's Love,93,79,audience,Lovely movie! Modern love story but set in the 50s
Sylvie's Love,93,79,audience,it is so refreshing seeing black love without all the toxicity that the media loves to portray!
Sylvie's Love,93,79,audience,"The mood, the atmosphere. The wardrobe, the look. Sylvie's Love has all the visual pleasures one could want in a sixties-set romance, but it's entangled narrative goes through its motions without sparking near as much pleasure or joy as these other aspects. Tessa Thompson and Nnamdi Asomugha are cute enough, but never develop a relationship worth standing up for whereas Eugene Ashe's shot of jazz-fueled direction is unable to save a movie whose destination was always known and whose journey doesn't compel us to believe in it anyway."
Sylvie's Love,93,79,audience,"The most BEAUTIFUL movie of the year! Absolutely gorgeous. Truly a feast for the eyes, ears, and soul. Breathtaking performances from the cast. The color palette is stunning, and the musical score is a dream. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!"
Sylvie's Love,93,79,audience,"Sylvie's Love is an overly old-fashioned romance for better and for worse. The music subplot took way too much screen time and the movie is definitely favoring style over substance, but the two main actors are both charming, the tone is pleasantly lightweight and the romance is great. It's Douglas Sirk meets La La Land basically."
Sylvie's Love,93,79,audience,"This movie is a breath of fresh air .The portrayal of 50s America is captivating the styles are magnetic and the acting riveting with a hit  soundtrack .
Plenty to come from these actors and Director ,I will keep an eye out for there future work .Really does make you want to fall in love again"
Sylvie's Love,93,79,audience,"This movie takes place in some sort of fantasy version of mid-20th century America, one in which everyone is very well clothed and housed and everything is always clean and bright. Oh, yes, there is a little bigotry, to be sure, but in the end it actually benefits the protagonist. Despite that, it's well made, and, frankly, I could watch Tessa Thompson doing pretty much anything for two hours. If you're trapped on an airplane, you could do worse than to watch this movie. Otherwise, skip it."
Sylvie's Love,93,79,audience,"This is a perfectly nice film. Yeah, seen this story before, and before that, but the fundamentals are handled well enough. Seems director Ashe hasn't made many films, but has the basics of structure, how to move a story along with proper pacing, and to get beautiful as well as skilled performers. 
Thompson is great, and gorgeous, but she always is. Asomugha is impressive as well, maintaining his character convincingly throughout. Nice to see Jemima Kirke, who is also great in her role. 
3 stars"
Sylvie's Love,93,79,audience,"Loved this film! The story line, music, visual filter, wardrobe, acting... such a job well done. A bittersweet love story. Would love to see more like it"
Sylvie's Love,93,79,audience,"Set in the 60s and often filled with music and dance in lieu of dialogue, 'Sylvie's Love' is gimmicky, but still left an impact.  This is a throwback to the bygone films of the era.  Costumes are wonderful and period perfect.  If you have to do a montage at the end to bring the tears and to bring your film together, your love story doesn't stand alone.  Worth watching, but overall a major disappointment.  Final Score: 6.8/10"
Sylvie's Love,93,79,critic,"
An elegant, charming, mature love story anchored by two great lead performances.

I love Tessa Thompson and her portrayal of Sylvie.
 "
Sylvie's Love,93,79,critic,"
Like the great Douglas Sirk melodramas... ""Sylvie's Love"" is unabashedly sentimental and just gorgeous to behold - but the difference here is the terrific ensemble cast is primarily Black and Latinx.
 "
Sylvie's Love,93,79,critic,"
Sylvie's Love is a soaring, swooning, old-school throwback that's primarily concerned with wrapping the audience in a sumptuous cinematic blanket of jazz, ambition, and starry-eyed enchantment. And boy, does it ever.
 "
Sylvie's Love,93,79,critic,"
Despite Thompson's efforts, ""Sylvie's Love"" eventually collapses under too many plot mechanisms.
 "
Sylvie's Love,93,79,critic,"
Boy meets girl Girl and falls in love. If only it were this easy. While not so simple, Sylvie's Love is a love story taking place in turbulent times but not draped in trauma.
 "
Sylvie's Love,93,79,critic,"
It's resplendent & swoon-worthy, but there's something wanting. Somehow it lacks the depth I was expecting, but the two leads have a dazzling chemistry + there are enough here to keep you engaged in their romantic journey.
 "
Sylvie's Love,93,79,critic,"
During an age where Black love stories weren't told in this matter, it's great that we've arrived at a place where it can be done.

Sylvie's Love is a beautiful showcase for Thompson and a love letter to a vanished New York.

It slowly builds its captivating and tense atmosphere, surprising us at every single turn and involving us in its complex moral dilemma. [Full Review in Spanish]

"Yalda, a Night for Forgiveness",94,,critic,"
The riveting and superbly acted Iranian drama, based on a real variety show, poses a moral crucible born out of a theocratic system that disfavors women amid the heightened tension of the on-camera spectacle.

A gripping Iranian drama.... Writer/director Massoud Bakhshi keeps the action nimble as drama unfolds on screen and off.
 "
"Yalda, a Night for Forgiveness",94,,critic,"
It's a tricky balancing act that requires increasingly high stakes, and in its quieter moments Yalda sometimes loses momentum. But the scenes during which everything clicks together are so uncomfortable and so tense that you won't soon forget them.

Timely, terrifying, and simultaneously overstrung, Yalda, a Night of Forgiveness is an excellent showcase for the limited instances of potential female agency.
 "
"Yalda, a Night for Forgiveness",94,,critic,"
As it is, Yalda, which overstays its welcome even at a brisk 80 minutes (the last five minutes feel like 80 by themselves), doesn't know what it wants to say, and so it says the worst possible thing it could say. What a shame.
 "
"Yalda, a Night for Forgiveness",94,,critic,"
A clever, suspenseful exposé of Sharia law.

A starkly shot, black and white drama that carries a ragged sincerity...
 "

La Leyenda Negra is a searing twist on the coming of age (and coming out) tale that feels like a new classic of U.S. Latino cinema.
 "
La leyenda negra,82,,critic,"
In ""La Leyenda Negra,"" a Latino-centric project with queer notes and major topical value, her fight (and that of those she represents) is communicated thunderously.
 "
La leyenda negra,82,,critic,"
An important film that tries to tackle too many subjects. Definitely not a case of style over substance as the strong narrative is sometimes drowned out by technical issues.

There's a shaggy energy throughout that gives the movie a sense of urgency.

La Leyenda Negra is the black-and-white narrative feature selected for Sundance that the current presidential administration doesn't want you to see.

An erratic yet necessary endeavor that couldn't possibly be more timely.
 "
40 Years a Prisoner,93,77,critic,"
Through his charisma, and the vigilance of he and the MOVE legal team, the film earns a satisfyingly simple dramatic climax, but it feels as if it leaves far too much of the story on the table.
 "
40 Years a Prisoner,93,77,critic,"
So many of our problems remain, but ""40 Years a Prisoner"" presents a valuable primer on what mistakes not to repeat.
 "
40 Years a Prisoner,93,77,critic,"

Compellingly and empathetically speaks out against a criminal justice system that protects an overwhelmingly white establishment through cruel and unusual sentencing.
 "
40 Years a Prisoner,93,77,critic,"
The gaps give Oliver's film a sense of incompleteness. But the story he does construct makes 40 Years A Prisoner another reminder of the repetitious history of American racism, and the prisoner and police reform still required to avoid the same mistakes.
 "
40 Years a Prisoner,93,77,critic,"
Ordinary but sufficiently effective in its execution, the film's most resonant segments are those where the upstanding son reflects on his torn family and a rotten system...

Mayor,100,92,audience,"If you are thinking of buying or renting this movie, do it, it is worth the price. David Osit does a fantastic job balencing tension with black comedy. It shows how the Palestinians are suffering under Israeli occupation with no bias towards the Israelis."
Mayor,100,92,audience,This film staggered me. The ending made me feel things I couldn't put into emotions and I just stared at my screen for 20 minutes. Loved this film and will never stop thinking about it.
Mayor,100,92,audience,"One of the most powerful documentaries I've ever seen. Osit does an exceptional job of capturing Ramallah through the daily life of the titular character, Mayor Musa Hadid, while at the same time creating an ambitious, often funny, and aesthetically pleasing film."
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
A riveting and human portrait of the very likable Musa Hadid... Briskly paced and expertly edited, Mayor is a humbling reminder that not all politicians are cynical opportunists.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
The film is filled with a surprising amount of good humor.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
Far from a message movie, David Osit's sensitive documentary is a captivating, enlightening, and ultimately terrifying look at how to survive day by day when the fight for liberation can seem everlasting.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
As he's the sort of personable, passionate politician a lot of people can identity with, ""Mayor"" leaves us with the hope that his plans don't come to nothing, and that with ""that clown"" out of Washington, maybe he'll find a more sympathetic ear here.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
A thought-provoking, considered and respectfully made film.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
Deft editing and unexpectedly affecting music choices make for an engaging portrait of the kind of impassioned and dedicated politician who seems in short supply right now.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
Smart, yet somewhat one-sided and process-orientated portrait of a man and his municipality.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
In its gently ironic way, the film depicts an urban centre keen to be treated, and run, as a genuine place to live, a town like any other.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
[An adjective] that describes [the protagonist] is steady, and the point director David Osit makes is that consistent, reliable leadership is underrated.

An illuminating alternative view into a divided political hot zone where most people seek a foothold of normalcy - and an intriguing juxtaposition and follow-on view to Frederick Wiseman's City Hall...
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
While understated and deeply personal, Mayor cannot avoid the current conflagration in the region.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
As Osit shows Hadid working to make Ramallah a place its people can take pride in, the mayor becomes an extraordinary documentary subject and we want to thank Osit for introducing us to Hadid and taking us inside his city.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
Essential viewing about the lines between small and grand acts of resistance.
 "
Mayor,100,92,critic,"
Osit doesn't push his subject, instead the director contrasts sometimes dryly funny day-to-day bureaucratic machinations with extraordinary events to give viewers a weighty sense of the existential.

Mayor,100,92,critic,"
A nice little microcosmic example of something that is happening in a larger conflict, but it does not necessarily contribute toward our understanding of the broader conflict.

No.7 Cherry Lane,86,,critic,"
Intellectually intoxicating and stylistically sumptuous, this romantic oddity about the passage of time evokes the grand elegance of a Wong Kar-wai epic infused with mature droplets akin to anime like ""Belladonna of Sadness"" or ""Millennium Actress.""

No.7 Cherry Lane,86,,critic,"
A sensual portrait of longing which frequently loses its narrative momentum to a litany of cinematic and literary references.

Divine Love,88,,audience,"In a Brazil of the near future in which fundamentalist Christianity has insidiously ingratiated itself into what is still a supposedly secular state, elements of the church and its ideology have intrusively invaded virtually every aspect of everyday life, affecting the rights of everyone, including non-believing ""infidels."" A society that has welcomed ecclesiastical discos and drive-through pastoral advice centers into its midst has also become one tinged with the faith's contemporary bureaucracy and beliefs about blasphemy. It's also one in which unbridled sexuality has been hypocritically rationalized into existence as part of its alleged sacred doctrines. But what happens when those ""values"" become toppled by unexpected and seemingly miraculous events that don't jibe with its dogma? That's what director Gabriel Mascaro's wickedly biting satire exposes, a humorous but stern cautionary tale of what can happen when religious conformity threatens to become so pervasive that it presents a clear and present danger to a nation's citizenry. As is the case with many of Mascaro's films, this offering includes a number of protracted and explicit sex sequences, so sensitive viewers be warned, but their inclusion is all part of the phony piety that goes into the rituals, practices and beliefs of a faith-based movement that essentially rings hollow and deserves to be exposed as such."
Divine Love,88,,critic,"
Divine Love is a quietly biting satire, brilliantly realized by Mascaro, a director who is operating on the highest level of artistry in every aspect.
 "
Divine Love,88,,critic,"
While the more shocking elements will bring attention to the film, it's the darker dramatic scenes that grab hold, recounting an involving, emotional journey that never overstates its staggering implications.
 "
Divine Love,88,,critic,"
Not entirely satisfying, but intriguing and original nonetheless, this is a speculative portrait of society at a constant low-level fever of religious hysteria that duly opiates the masses-but has no place for the nonconforming individual.
 "
Divine Love,88,,critic,"
I feel like this movie had less of the stuff I wanted and was made up more of boring and redundant scenes.
 "
Divine Love,88,,critic,"
With sci-fi touches and sanctimonious eroticism, the incisive satire intently takes on the influence of evangelical Christianity on the state - namely the far-right movement that elected populist Jair Bolsonaro.
 "
Divine Love,88,,critic,"
The material is timeless, but it thinks it's a timely, sociopolitical warning. As weird as the script thinks it is, it's never really that weird.

Whether you read it as satire, science fiction or admonitions about our increasingly totalitarian times, the film's concluding monologue is one of mystical profundity. Very provocative.

For all its tangible glimpses into a near future dictated by the religious right, the dystopian world building can't make up for an unfocused character study at the centre.

This is a shocking, wonderfully acted and surprisingly erotic film that leaves one with more questions than answers, like any good film that dares to tackle the vastness of faith should.

Through his exquisite vision, Mascaro tells a curious tale of spiritual commitment, marital strife, and the blurred separation of church and state, leading to an ultimately surprising, powerful conclusion.

A profound cinematic question about the nature of the country's conflicted soul.

Charlie's Angels,52,78,audience,Cringy. The storyline was lacking and took itself way too seriously.
Charlie's Angels,52,78,audience,This was surprisingly really enjoyable.
Charlie's Angels,52,78,audience,Hollow and not even entertaining.
Charlie's Angels,52,78,audience,"Uneven story, some of the action and the plot was good and interesting. I found myself about 2/3 of the way through not caring if I finished watching or not..."
Charlie's Angels,52,78,audience,"A very good movie, much better than the previous reboot movies. The actors were really in the zone and brought out their best in all of the scenes.  Action was great, storyline just a tad predictable but very acceptable."
Charlie's Angels,52,78,audience,"I'll start by saying, you can tell Kristen Stewart is having a lot of fun in this movie and in turn this is the most enjoyment I have gotten from any of her previous outings. Ella Balinska & Naomi Scott complete the new trio of Angels nicely. 
The standout for me was Luis Gerardo Mendez as Saint, the Townsend Agency weapons and tech guru. Some fun back & forth with the Angels.

The action was fun but I have found it to be ultimately forgettable and has unfortunately not left me clambering for the franchise to continue on."
Charlie's Angels,52,78,audience,Didn't take itself to seriously. Everything I was expecting.
Charlie's Angels,52,78,audience,"Me gustó la trama de la película, no me despegue de la pantalla, aunque faltó más ver justas a las nuevas ángeles, luchar juntas con sus habilidades y conocimientos que cada una tenía, pero podría aparecer en una siguiente película."
Charlie's Angels,52,78,audience,"Refreshing! Strong female leads. No exploitation of women. Highly entertaining, Over the top slapstick action, with some serious subtext. It is a good film for women and girls. Well acted, well directed, well produced. Good solid entertainment with a positive message."
Charlie's Angels,52,78,audience,"this wasn't the worst movie I've seen.

Acting was good mostly, but everyone but stewart, I just never felt like she had the chops to be a great actor.  Story should have been mostly fine, I just found this movie boring really.  I did like that they took a more serious aspect of the franchise, but maybe that's what made the previous 3 better, they just seemed like they had more fun in those 3 first ones."
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
Starring the most diverse, female-empowered cast ever, Charlie's Angels has still never felt more vanilla.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
Though Stewart isn't positioned as the team leader, she feels like one in spirit, reminding everyone around her to loosen up - and that is reason alone to see the movie.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
Terrible action choreography and what appears to be a total lack of sensible stunts.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
Charlie's Angels is a worthy continuation of a franchise with plenty of creative juice remaining; delivers due to wonderful camaraderie, Banks' passionate direction and an overall sense of fun that leaves you wanting more from the series.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
Mostly keeps its foot so firmly on the gas pedal that it gets away with an uninspiring and not entirely convincing conspiracy plot.

If you want escapist fun, have at it, but if you want something original, sorry Charlie.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
In 2019, Charlie's Angels is less about impossibly perfect women saving the world and more about women joining forces to save the world. It's the direct opposite of the lens used by the men of the film...

Despite having a pedigree ... this movie stands on its own, creating a new vision for the franchise. Does this new vision work? Yes and no.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
It's a fun film, packed with glitter and guts, that feels refreshingly modern without taking on too much pomp and prestige.

Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
The story limps from one scene to another, with only a few sporadically entertaining moments.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"

 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
Nothing in it really pops... It's like watching people pretending to have fun, instead of actually having fun and sharing it with us.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
The movie is at its best whenever Kristen Stewart is on screen, clearly relishing the chance to show off her comedic chops, and thankfully she's rarely not on it.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
While the 2000s-era films were far from cinematic greats, their physics-defying stunts and action set pieces made them something that audiences flocked to. And therein lies the problem with the latest iteration: It's not any fun.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
There is no room for complexity, ambiguity, or thought: no space, in effect, for any interpretation that has not already been carefully spoon-fed to its audience.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
[It's] rarely subversive, but is sincere and thoughtful even in its most pandering, commodified moments.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
An underlying 'mean girls' streak contradicts the feminist ideals that Charlie's Angels tries to convey.
 "

But this is a rare multiplex movie that rewards patience, with the action and the goofiness ramping up in the second hour.
 "
Charlie's Angels,52,78,critic,"
Charlie's Angels is a total blast to watch, like the breeziest film possible from the Mission: Impossible mold with a great blend of comedy and action.

Fighting With My Family,93,86,audience,"I should probably begin this with a disclosure that I am a WWE fan and I was very glad to see this project get a serious and proper theatrical release with some name actors, specifically Nick Frost and Lena Headey. In saying that, this is your typical, feel good sports movie with nothing much really added to it and at times felt it was just another platform for WWE to market themselves to fans/potential new fans. The film follows a young woman Paige (real name Saraya Knight) and her brother Zak who grew up in a wrestling family. While WWE is briefly in England they both are invited to tryout. Paige is selected while her older brother is not. Paige has to move away from her family to train in the States and in striving to become a WWE Superstar, finds her true self in the process. Florence Pugh who plays Saraya/Paige does a great job displaying Paige's vulnerability and lack of self-confidence. Typically, I like Vince Vaughn's work but felt he was a little out of place with this role as the WWE trainer. Overall, I did enjoy this film and I would like to see more of these made as others have equally inspiring stories to tell."
Fighting With My Family,93,86,audience,Very entertaining especially if you have any sort of interest in wrestling. Would have been interested to see it with more of a drama vibe but it plays well as a family movie. 
Fighting With My Family,93,86,audience,"RATING: A-  Director: Stephen Merchant 
Fighting With My Family is hilarious at points and full of heart too. Florence Pugh ( one of the best newcomers of recent years, in my eyes ) is brilliant as always,  as is the rest of the Cast. Before watching the film I actually didn't knew,  that it was the Biopic about the wrestler Paige. Stephen Merchant directs great and I didn't expect the cameo he actually had. Yes at points it's the classical sports underdog Story but it's just so much more than that."
Fighting With My Family,93,86,audience,I find this a very bizarre film in a good way and tells a pretty good wrestling story. I also love that the Rock is playing himself and is defiantly the best part.
Fighting With My Family,93,86,audience,"This movie was INCREDIBLY GOOD.  I say incredibly, because I didn't think I would enjoy it!  Going into Fighting With My Family, I didn't know anything outside of previously being bombarded with ads for it on a XFinity (I think?) streaming channel in-between shows.  I knew it was about wrestling, contained family bonding elements, and it all seemed so cliché that I wasn't very interested.  My intuition failed me, because this movie actually blew me away.
     Fighting With My Family is a feel-good movie about a woman who rises above the odds to achieve her dream.  Simply put, it is about family, perseverance, dedication, and kindness, but it somehow delivers these in a POWERFUL, emotionally-gripping way.  If you told me that I was going to give a shit about Page (we dropped the ""i"" hahahahaha, see the movie) by the end of this movie, I would not have believed you.  You should see this movie.

     SPOILERS (DON'T KEEP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A LITTLE SPOILED):::
     Then the movie ends and I start to leave, only for a montage to show up starring a real woman named Page who truly wrestles in the WWE.  This was her story.  That's about the moment I lost it and started saying out loud, ""HOW HAVE I NOT HEARD ABOUT THIS MOVIE!?!?!!?!?""  Holy shit, it's a true story!  Her parents really are like that, her brother, her friends, wow this feels like it all really happened!  To watch so many movies and see so many cliché happy moments that have induced eye-rolling in me lately, finding out that this story was real just made me feel incredible good.  There are parents who give a shit about their kids and who won't give up on them, despite being sleezy themselves.  There are managers who appear prickly cold, who in reality know the business so well they've begun to protect others from the suffering they've experienced.  There are cheerleaders and dancers who get shit on for being who they are, who are simultaneously incredible athletes that must train and work hard like everyone does.  I know this should be some common sense stuff, but this movie pieces it all together in an emotionally resonant way that left me feeling.... pretty damn good!  Go see it and you will leave feeling better than you did when you went in!"
Fighting With My Family,93,86,audience,It's a competent enough movie to sit down and watch spontaneously but it's still a modern female wrestling version of 1976's 'Rocky' combined with family comedy tropes and some inexplicable errors in the script.
Fighting With My Family,93,86,audience,"Love this film. If you were sleeping on Florence Pugh, time to wake up. Authentic locations and strong supporting cast, Fighting With My Family provides viewers with a look into the life of a young woman pursuing her dreams, even if such viewers don't give a toss about pro-wrestling. One of 2019's best films."
Fighting With My Family,93,86,audience,"I typically hate biopics, but I'd be more inclined towards them if more of them looked like this film."
Fighting With My Family,93,86,audience,Absolutely loved it! Definitely a movie to watch if you want to lift your spirits.
Fighting With My Family,93,86,audience,"I'm not really a wrestling fan, but I do like Stephen Merchant and this was an entertaining if somewhat predictable movie."
Fighting With My Family,93,86,critic,"
Fighting with My Family is a fun and surprising emotional story about a quirky, ambitious clan. Wrestling fans may be most drawn to it, but it still has a lot to offer even if you've never watched a match in your life.
 "
Fighting With My Family,93,86,critic,"
This movie is definitely funny, but it also has an emotional heft I didn't expect.
 "
Fighting With My Family,93,86,critic,"
It is a universal story about outcasts who create community through sport and heart combined with the kind of ""soap opera in spandex"" storytelling that has made wrestling so popular.
 "
Fighting With My Family,93,86,critic,"
It is thanks to Merchant that the film achieves what it sets out to do ... His characters, though based on real people, pop off the screen and take on a life of their own. They may just make a wrestling fan out of you by the end of it.

It never quite settles into a real comedic stride, but there are enough touching themes about the impact of thwarted dreams, having conviction in your own sense of self, and sparks of Stephen Merchant's wit to endear the audience to the story.

Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,audience,"I would've loved to say ""nice try"", but it wasn't nice at all.

How come is 2020 and we still get movies with such a messy CGI? If you have a good eye you can even detect what's a green screen and what's not. Unfortunately, the CGI isn't the only problem, everything is.

A story that used to terrorize children with its creepy imagery and scary witches is gone, getting extremely childish and boring. Everything is so crumbled and explained since the very beginning, leaving no room for further surprises.

The talent (including writers and director), well, wasted at all costs. Both Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer have a special place in my heart, but not even their talent was enough to save this weak and failed effort to revive the 1990 classic. Anjelica Huston cannot be dethroned that easily, sorry."
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,audience,"Obviously, the makeup, set, and costume teams deserve praise, but I expected better CGI from a movie made in 2020. I thought it was odd that Kristen Chenoweth played the voice of a child, especially given that her voice is so recognizable. Why couldn't the childhood friend who was turned into a chicken talk, while the children who were turned into mice could? Anjelica Huston's Grand High Witch was scarier, although Anne Hathaway's mouth was pretty freaky and reminded me of the Joker. All in all, an appropriate new movie to watch in the days leading to Halloween!"
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,audience,"The original 1990 movie was better , don't bother with this"
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,audience,"For me, this movie was even better than  Roeg's 1990 ‘Witches' film, as we have a genuinely brilliant version of the book.   I think we have a future star in Jahzir Kadeem Bruno as the young Hero Boy who is turned into a mouse by the Grand High Witch.  He captures the sorrow of a child who has lost his parents at the start of the movie  perfectly, with a touching performance  .  Octavia Spencer is so brilliant as The Grandmother that you never doubt that she is really talking to a mouse. Anne Hathaway is so convincing as the Grand High Witch chief that you need to be prepared to be scared by her !   I would definitely recommend this movie to any family."
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,audience,"It kind of works for kids who haven't seen the original. They went heavy on CGI which kills the whole magic for me. Ann Hathaway wasn't a good choice for the GHW either, obviously . Octavia Spencer was the only redeeming character. She's a more charismatic grandma than the original, and the chemistry with the kid actor is better."
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,audience,"Having no affinity for the 1990 adaptation of the 1983 Roald Dahl novel the hope in knowing Oscar-winner Robert Zemeckis was going to direct and produce an updated and more faithful-to-the-source material version of the story alongside fellow Best Director winners Alfonso Cuarón and Guillermo del Toro was that it would prove to be the project that gave Zemeckis his mojo back. Unfortunately, Zemeckis continues to taint his pre-2000 career with this re-imagining rather than restoring any faith that the same man who made Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Death Becomes Her is still alive. 

2020's The Witches isn't terrible, this should be noted. If this were made by a less prominent filmmaker and didn't have the precedent of Nicolas Roeg's original adaptation on which to base expectation this would maybe have more a sense of novelty to it, but given the context this largely feels like another excuse for Zemeckis to experiment with his interests in advancing the technical aspects of movie-making rather than tell a fun, entrancing story. Like all Dahl stories, The Witches makes no qualms about not softening the blow of life's truths to its young protagonists; forcing them to deal with the challenges hurled in their direction as there is no way of escaping them, but only dealing with them. While this trademark is evident throughout Zemeckis' film the frightening in pursuit of enlightening never feels as fundamental to the DNA of the proceedings as the order in which these events are doled out does. It's as if Zemeckis has replaced the intrinsic DNA of Dahl's characters, world, and circumstances with calculations rather than constructing them in a live-action fashion to better understand what the author was trying to relay...and while I've only seen the 1990 film once and as an adult, I can say with absolute certainty that film captured the darkly comic shades of Dahl's work far better than this new one. I don't even know if I chuckled at anything here other than Octavia Spencer's sassy Southern grandma.

Speaking of Spencer, if Zemeckis had simply made a film about the relationship between a grandmother and her grandson and how that bond grew and evolved after the death of her daughter and his mother I think we and the director may have all been better off as the first half hour or so prior to any titular characters showing up is wholly charming and natural in a way that makes what follows feel all the more contrived. Spencer is fantastic as always, Anne Hathaway is having a blast, and Stanley Tucci doesn't deserve the GIF that will become of him from his mess of a part. The Witches isn't bad enough to cuss out, but it doesn't utilize all its potential to create something as wondrously weird as each individual aspect would suggest it could be. It's dust in the wind, but then again that's what critics said about Hocus Pocus in 1993 and we see the juggernaut that has become. So, don't ask me what the destiny of 2020's The Witches is, the kids know better."
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,audience,"Ann Hathaway is over the top, screams from beginning to end with an accent that simply is Indescribable?
The trailer gives the impression that this will be a glamorous re-make for the very famous and much loved classic. But, unfortunately, it ends up lacking. 
The film feels rushed, with no build ups or suspense and leaves you feeling that the producers have left out many of the many memorable moments from the original film. 
The cast and trailer had me excited before I pressed play, but after watching, I feel the I've wasted an hour and a half of my life. The old staying, if it's not broke, don't fix it!"
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,audience,"I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed this adaptation, it's fresh and true to the story. Also some fantastic performances."
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,audience,"The performances were good but the cgi is horrendous, totally killed the movie for me. 2020 yet the cgi looks like it's from 2000"
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,audience,I am embaressed for all the talent that went into this. Overacted and just dumb.
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,critic,"
There's a lack of overall magic, either of the twisted or charming type - unless sending viewers clamouring to find wherever the original is currently streaming counts.
 "
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,critic,"
Robert Zemeckis never tries to make the slight story anything more than what it is, hitting the high points from the book with the gusto they deserve.
 "
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,critic,"
Those who were terrified by the 1990 version may be put off by a lack of practical effects and Hathaway's absolutely over-the-top performance in the 2020 film. But the new version ought to inspire and truly terrify a new generation of budding horror fans.
 "
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,critic,"
This new adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic is yet another example of how a film can end up being so much less than the sum of its parts.

Hathaway gets off the easiest, vamping it up with an accent best described as ""Norwegian Dracula,"" while Spencer is reduced to playing straight woman to a bunch of mice.

Dahl demands some darkness and edge, but instead there's a bright Hollywood-y antic sense, and the overused and unconvincing FX only serves to further trivialize what we're seeing.

With Stanley Tucci very amusing as the hotel manager and Spencer giving a wonderfully warm performance, the film is never less than engaging. The visual effects, some of them created in Melbourne, are excellent...
 "
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,critic,"
A passable, if unremarkable remake of Roald Dahl's dark tale about a coven of holidaying witches plotting to turn the world's children into mice. Anne Hathaway can't top Anjelica Huston's performance as head witch, but shows the requisite relish.
 "
Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,critic,"
This Witches tinkers with the mythology of the book to little effect.

Roald Dahl's The Witches,48,34,critic,"
Despite the storytelling royalty, it's rather vanilla and pedestrian in the telling and doesn't rise above mostly mediocre.

Who could improve on the regal fury of Anjelica Huston?... Certainly not Anne Hathaway, whose performance in this remake, by comparison, has more than a tinge of the high school drama club.

Bad Education,94,84,audience,"Bad Education is an engrossing comedy drama, with Jackman at his best. It is a subdued telling from Finley, who lets the performers keep you gripped. This film is a good education in itself."
Bad Education,94,84,audience,"Despite a slow opening, this fact-based tale about the largest school funding embezzlement case in US history manages to get on track about 30 minutes in and runs with it from there to its gripping conclusion. Director Cory Finley's second outing, a made-for-cable offering nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for best screenplay, features strong performances by Allison Janney, Ray Romano and Hugh Jackman (easily a career best) in bringing the material to life with snappy wit, unbridled guile, and the well-honed, carefully camouflaged skills of slick sociopaths. While the picture's overall tone could use a better balance in its mix of comedy and drama, more back story, and improved handling of some of its ancillary story threads, this production nevertheless delivers the goods, providing viewers with a solidly entertaining package."
Bad Education,94,84,audience,"Not what I expected, but totally enthralling and a class A performance from Mr Jackman. Well worth a watch."
Bad Education,94,84,audience,"So I thought this was going to be a dark comedy, but it turned out to be a based on a true story movie that was uneven in tone. I don't know it it was the acting, the make-up, and the music but it was just off. The story was okay, but I couldn't decide who I was supposed to like or who the real hero was in the story. Overall it just isn't a great movie and not really worth the time. I did like the fact that it showed there can be corruption in all government work including public education. "
Bad Education,94,84,audience,"""Bad Education"" presents an effective true story with an exceptional performance from Hugh Jackman. He is one of my favorite actors, and this movie shines primarily because of his work. The movie unfolds in genuinely surprising ways and I found myself fascinated to see how it would play out. It is one of those movies that made me look up the real events afterward, which I think always is a compliment to the storytelling of a biopic. Overall, it is an interesting film that shouldn't be overlooked as just a TV movie, because the quality of how it is made and the performances make it just as impressive as something I would see in the theater."
Bad Education,94,84,audience,"Absolutely loved it. Laughed out loud throughout. Incredible performances and perfectly directed dark humor. The ""accelerate"" scene had me in stitches."

Cory Finley goes two-for-two with this gripping embezzlement drama that's based on a jaw-dropping true story and features a career-best performance from Hugh Jackman.
 "

Finley employs a similar sense of verve and style seen in his debut, keeping a tight rein on camera movement and embellishing the visuals with small flourishes that ingratiate us into the increasingly icky interior of these people's lives.

Bad Boys for Life,77,96,audience,"Directors Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi try to be Michael Bay and fail. 
I was looking forward to the third movie of this amazing Franchise, then once I found out Bay would not be returning to Direct I was worried.... It's alright for what it is but it's No Bad Boys or Bad Boys 2."
Bad Boys for Life,77,96,audience,Good fun! Wishing there were fun movies like this one nowadays.
Bad Boys for Life,77,96,audience,"A very entertaining and satisfying conclusion to this trilogy spanning the last 25 years. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are back to their old tricks again as Detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey (respectively). The story follows the 2 aging detectives: Lawrence who's ready to hang it up and retire, while Lowrey still has the need for speeds, action, and women. While enjoying a night on the town, Lowrey is shot and left clinging for his life. Luckily it's not his time yet as he seeks revenge. But he has to go it alone with a new team titled AMMO, as Lawrence makes good on his desire to retire. I'm glad they were able to recast some old faces from previous BAD BOYS films, and while this was an enjoyable and fun ride, it beats out the sequel BAD BOYS II, but can't faze the original. I'm sure this is the end of the road for both characters and it was a nice send off."

Bad Boys for Life,77,96,audience,"It was horrible. Movies back in the days where so much better. The spirit is gone and so is the moral. Every movie nowadays seems so dark.What happened to the film industry? 90's and 80's movies, even early 00's is better than this crap."
Bad Boys for Life,77,96,audience,"It's obvious that they put a lot of effort into action, cinematics, and martial arts. However, details in the scenery don't add up. There are too many plot holes. Nobody seemed to bother making this production authentic. Of course, it's primarily supposed to be a comedy. But that doesn't mean that storywriting doesn't matter anymore. The most ludicrous idea of this is the ""witch"" attribution and theme. Looks like the typical streamlined stuff you get nowadays. Throw some ideas and themes together, put it in a mixer, and you can make some money. Because it's Will Smith. Don't look at the details. Look at Will Smith."
Bad Boys for Life,77,96,audience,Corrupted immoral police officers dishonor the uniform they wear. And the movie is silent about that (by thus taking their side). I would remove my name from the credits by all means if it was there.

Black Christmas,38,31,audience,"Really average film with extremely annoying female characters who constantly bitch about men. The kill scenes and jump scares were weak, I think the target audience was aimed at 12 year old girls."
Black Christmas,38,31,audience,"The second remake of the 1974 classic and this was by far the worst. If you're a fan of horror and can look past the excessive amount of misandry throughout the film, then you may enjoy it. However, it's so obvious and heavy handed that as a male, yeah, I had a problem with it. Not to mention the entire third act which was an absolute trainwreck and story wise, too ludicrous. Women will whine and complain about not getting enough representation to make movies, however, when they make garbage such as this or CHARLIE'S ANGELS, and they segregate half of the population, don't be surprised when it bombs at the box office!"
Black Christmas,38,31,audience,"Did they really try to sell this as a remake of the original? That's an insult. It's nothing like it and the synopsis is misleading. A mysterious cloaked murderer? Just one? 

Other than that it was cheesy with political bs. This was a waste of budget."
Black Christmas,38,31,audience,"Thoroughly hated this movie. Terrible storyline, too many jump cuts and the film seemed to push away from the horror genre and move to a political agenda. This does not deserve the title of Black Christmas. Plus the commercial tells everything about the movie and gives away all information. Don’t waste your time. "
Black Christmas,38,31,audience,Social justice warrior movie all the way not really funny not really scary wouldn't watch it again ways to improve would be to not shove your social justice bs down our throats for an hour of the hour and 30 minute movie
Black Christmas,38,31,audience,"Extremely stupid movie. Badly acted and terribly written script. It is a horror, but only if you decide to waste your time for it."
Black Christmas,38,31,audience,"I try not to be a negative person, but what was that?!? It fails as a remake of Black Christmas, but fails as a horror movie too. Cannot recommend."
Black Christmas,38,31,audience,Black Christmas is a disappointing film. It is about a group of female students who is stalked by a stranger during their Christmas break. Imogen Poots and Aleyse Shannon give terrible performances. The script is badly written. Sophia Takal did a horrible job directing this movie. I was not impressed with this motion picture.
Black Christmas,38,31,audience,"Have any arrests been made for this? Because this is a crime against movie making. I've seen bad movies that were bad for many reasons. Bad plot, but good acting. Good plot, but bad acting. Good plot and acting, but terrible effects and makeup. This one has it all. Bad plot, bad acting, bad effects. The worst ""horror"" movie I've ever seen."
Black Christmas,38,31,audience,It's shit. Do not watch it and let burn in fire
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
While I didn't cheer at every moment, or buy into every pandering feminist anthem slapped into each scene, I had a great time, and I sense the divide to be suggestive of pending cult status.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
A failed remake, where the feminist plot prevents the one related to the slasher from flowing. Too many pretensions that end up leaving the fun of this genre on the way.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
You can see the effects of the rushed production unfolding on screen one scene at a time.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
Could be scarier, it could be funnier, and it really shoots itself in the foot with that cornball finale.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
I know how hard people work on films... [but] Lord it went downhill real fast.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
Blumhouse has finally realised that female filmmakers exist, and that's a good thing for everyone.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
For me, Black Christmas worked a treat. It was a joy to watch, even with its flaws (the poor sound design and lack of an impactful score in particular).
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
The film is an exquisite feast for the mind, it's not so much for the action or jump scares. Whatever you think about Black Christmas, you cannot deny its importance.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
It means it ends up feeling like Sucker Punch without the dodgy visuals, or Cry Wolf sans the preppy uniforms and charismatic cast.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
The entire finished product feels like it was just rushed out into theaters as quick as possible.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
There's nothing clever about Black Christmas, and with an anemic PG-13 rating, even the horror parts do nothing to make anyone's dreams of a black Christmas come true.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
The choice to go PG-13 on the gore and thrill level for this reboot makes it feel more like a TV movie than a feature film. Still, it was probably the right choice for the intended audience.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
Black Christmas ends up being a lump of coal with its poor screenplay and weak character development, even if it has some fun moments.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
Wrong-headed is an understatement in this new approach to the material and we are taken for a third act ride that is equal parts baffling and preposterous.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
We need more feminist genre cinema, but that doesn't mean we have to accept half-baked films like this.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
I love the mass murder of a bunch of rapist Kavanaughs as much as anyone, believe me, though I'm not sure the catharsis it proffers is anything but temporary--or, worse, merely palliative.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
A darkly satisfying festive surprise. ...A rallying cry for all of us to be fighters, to stop just accepting that this is how things are, and to take control of our destiny.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
The #MeToo movement was a primal scream that rose up from the throats of women. Black Christmas is an echo of that initial feeling.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
Into the last act, we're hit with some whopper twists in a final sequence that proves completely unexpected, moderately intriguing and unbelievably ridiculous, all at once.
 "
Black Christmas,38,31,critic,"
Watching it, I went from bored to confused to occasionally intrigued, but never entertained or scared.

Crawl,84,75,audience,It was a lovely creature feature with a twist of natural disaster in it. I was ready for a lame movie but it was pretty cool and the song in the end.. loved it. Acting was also on point.
Crawl,84,75,audience,Esta película vale la pena sufrirla con tal de escuchar la rolita del final. Buen tema el de los créditos.
Crawl,84,75,audience,"So boring. I can hear the pitch meeting-- ""Hey, I have an idea for a movie. Big storm, girl gets stuck inside with alligators."" ""Then what?"" ""No, that's the entire plot."""
Crawl,84,75,audience,"The intelligence of these characters are infuriating. The Dad's backstory is completely impossible. Who goes to fix a sink during a category 5 hurricane in a house no one lives in? Also the movies treat these gators as these unstoppable cunning killing machines one moment, and dumb animals in the next breath. Make up your mind movie! At the end I was rooting for the main characters to die. These characters deserve a Darwin Award."
Crawl,84,75,audience,"Things that I liked: 
+ the acting 
+ the actors who played Haley and the dad. 
+ the dog 
+ the big house 
+ Morfydd Clark (who is so good in Saint Maud)
+ the alligators
+ the CGI 
+ the simple story 

Things that could have been better: 
- the gore/kills (when I watched The Hill have Eyes I thought that Crawl was another gore fest, but I wasn't. The gore felt like a huge letdown after Alexandre directed THVE)
- The reason why the dad was in the house (was so unnecessary)
- the runtime (why 87 minutes? It could have been at least 95 minutes. That is the perfect runtime for a short movie, although I like movies above 120 minutes)"
Crawl,84,75,audience,"Terrible - and I love terrible movies.  Idiotic.  Debasing of alligators/ crocodiles (in Florida we have both!  but those were alligators, and acted like neither).  Rain was nice, though."
Crawl,84,75,audience,"Crawl is an interesting take of two people struggling to survive against a group of alligators. I love the performances of Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper, the visual effects, direction and story. Overall, Crawl is Jaws of the 21st century."
Crawl,84,75,audience,"Dang, how disappointing. Crawl doesn’t even manage to pull the best features out of a B movie, but instead showcases a worthless, poor decision making dad and a daughter who is less interesting than the dog (who is adorable by the way). So many ridiculous situations from this Jaws wannabe. Even on a rainy day, skip this one"
Crawl,84,75,audience,"A really good fun film. Nothing to serious, but it does exactly what it says on the tin."
Crawl,84,75,audience,"Crawl, yes! This movie was epic! The dog was credited and that made me love the movie even more"
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
In Crawl, the threats, tension and WTF moments came equally from storm and sharp, pointy teeth alike.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
A lean, mean, biting machine delivered by the more than capable hands of Alexandre Aja, who is no stranger to the aquatic horror sub-genre.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
The computer-animated alligators are mostly convincing, and the graphic attacks are thoroughly engaging.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
It's just tension the whole time and... there's a lot going on in this film which I love.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
It's a raucous onslaught of gator-based chaos that, much like its central predator, sinks its teeth into everything that moves.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
Alexandre Aja builds ferocious tension, and everything looks very dirty and visceral. But the relationship between dad and daughter really sells the film.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
A hopelessly conventional horror B-movie built on hurricanes, cardboard characters, and computer-generated alligators. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
It never adds up to a great movie or even a movie that's as nutty as it could have been, but at no time did I doubt the modesty on display here. Crawl wants people to have fun.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
Add in those gator growls, and it's about scary as hell. I will say no more about the film. Avoid the trailer. Go in blind. And enjoy.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
""A bit over the top with it's 'go get 'em champ' mentality, but the alligators scared the bejeezus out of me ... So admittedly a fun and anxious ride.""
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
Crawl is a B-movie made by A-level talent ... an all-out, full tilt boogie creature feature.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
Finally - and, for creature feature fans, most importantly - the alligators themselves are suitably believable and menacing.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
Ridiculous but effective, and just tense and plausible enough to invoke the demon of claustrophobia and our primordial fear of being munched and digested to death.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
Crawl is a nearly perfect horror film. It runs 87 minutes; there isn't a single wasted frame of film in the entire runtime, and every setup gets the payoff you'd expect.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
It did what it wanted to do successfully.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
I, for the most part, unironically enjoyed this film.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
Kudos also go to Aja for staging some of the effective yet well-timed suspenseful moments, particularly the way he executes close calls and near-death experiences during the few encounters with one or sometimes more alligators.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
In short, CRAWL has bite. For the most part, everyone involved makes creative decisions that work, creating a white-knuckle thrill ride of a creature feature.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
...The imagination of the film's set pieces are more than enough to make this a worthy piece of Friday night entertainment.
 "
Crawl,84,75,critic,"
In an hour and a half we get to enjoy people being chased by despicable creatures. [Full Review in Spanish]

Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,audience,"Probably the best of the trilogy but that's not saying much. A few misdirection's to keep the audience guessing on the jump scares. Like any movie within this series there is a few but felt the pace was slower than it maybe should have been. It's always great to see Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga sink back into their roles as the Warrens. Even young Mckenna Grace as their daughter Judy Warren showed some range for such a young actress. Other than that, just as with every spin-off within the Conjuring Universe, it didn't do it for me."
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,audience,this is one of my least fav conjuring films because it's just pretty boring.
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,audience,Why was i in the second one
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,audience,"Boring, predictable and forgettable."
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,audience,I enjoyed this. The setting just like the previous films was done very well and this time explored more the warrens locked room. If you spooky stuff and jump scares id recommend this film. It also ends on a very light hearted note for a horror film. A very enjoyable experience.
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,audience,I almost fell asleep in the. Whole movie
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,audience,"Annabelle Comes Home builds the Conjuring series timeline with good scares, a great  cast, and some wicked special effects."
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,audience,"Very trite and boring horror movie. Everyone walks very slowly, opens doors very slowly, walks towards scary things, characters with typical horror movie idiot syndrome. I got bored while watching them walk like a snail so I decided to type this review. It has some suspenseful moments but it’s so predictable."
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,audience,"La película fue muy buena, sin embargo no logro asustarme."
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,audience,"Annabelle Comes Home is brilliant. This is the best ""cursed objects"" story ever told by Hollywood. The Warrens (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are like the wife/husband version of the Winchester brothers from tv's Suprernatural. And the haunted events that take place around thier lives are fascinating (and lots of fun to watch). This is a movie franchise worth the fandom and the investment. To the makers of the Warren's cinematic story: Please keep 'em coming."
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
Beautifully made, creepy and entertaining, Annabelle Comes Home provides the continuity with the other stories we've missed without being part of an overall arc. Good show.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
An old-fashioned film that doesn't rely on gore to sell the thrills. Instead there's lots of laboured breathing, wide eyed disbelief, low-fi drive-in thrills and characters you want to survive.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
A worthy addition to the ""Conjuring"" universe, this is the best of the three ""Annabelle"" movies because it's an old school horror film modest in scope, yet high on scares and fun.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
It has no tension.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
Annabelle Comes Home contains a lot of things that go bump in the night but, if you listen carefully, you can hear the cash registers pinging too.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
Annabelle may be the most evil doll in horror right now, but so far anyways she still plays and slays old school style, and for this homecoming it works.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
A frivolous, but fun bundle of frights, helped along no end by a funky 70s production design and soundtrack.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
It's certainly a clever idea, but it's done in the exact same style as all previous entries, with exactly the same level of filmmaking panache. Basically, this is more of the same.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
Annabelle Comes Home isn't much more than spooky funhouse nonsense, but that's all it needs to be - and for the third film in a spinoff franchise, that's pretty darn good.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
Annabelle needs to go home and retire forever.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
Thiis is an uncommonly handsome scary movie, one that respects the audience's intelligence while delivering all the requisite chills and just the right amount of gore.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
Super scary, in a truly fun way, even if a bit over the top. I love diving into the world of the Warren families' 'room of evil things.' This made me want to see a movie about their daughter Judy, who already sees ghosts.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
While the filmmaking displayed on a technical level allows the film to achieve heightened production values, this one can't help but play exclusively in the realm of cheap thrills.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
The best of the Annabelle films...
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
The picture just rehashes the same stuff this series has already done multiple times before.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
It's a razor sharp, tension-filled psychological thriller whose best weapon is the way it teases its audience with scares and violence, even if any rarely comes. ... That's what makes it fun. That's what makes audiences want to come back for more.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
It felt like like a made-for-TV, disposable [film]... It's not anything special.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
Annabelle Comes Home is the Captain America: Civil War of The Conjuring Universe - the stakeless if very fun roller-coaster ride of a movie given extra heft by taking the main characters of the franchise over to its spin-off.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
Beyond a delight in mood, there's no attempt to do anything with Annabelle that hasn't been done in the earlier films, and frequently quite a bit less.
 "
Annabelle Comes Home,65,70,critic,"
This feels more like the launch of a horror collection than a third and valid entry for a franchise that has suffered enough. [Full review in Spanish].

Men in Black: International,23,66,audience,This movie is far from bad or trash in fact it's a pretty good movie. While I hate the fact that J and K weren't in it we did at least see nice nods to them showing respect to the OG films. We should be thankful that they weren't killed off so that they could be replaced like a lot of other films down. I agree not all the jokes land but the characters are very charming and the villains are pretty cool. What I hope happens from here in a Men in Black Cinematic universe and maybe even a film where the two film mains meet one another.
Men in Black: International,23,66,audience,I onnicially liked this but as time passed I realised that Hemsworth and Thompson don't work as well as Jones and Smith. Hemsworth isn't as funny as Smith and the Comedy falls flat.
Men in Black: International,23,66,audience,"This is Up to MIB Standards and I thought it would not be good because there was no J, and K. but it is Awesome"
Men in Black: International,23,66,audience,"Okay so as the common man might think I am being too harsh on my personal rating, the true fan will understand. And what really made up my mind about it is...well...because I watched MIB 3 right before International. Aside from the soundtrack and the suit...it carries nothing from the previous movies. The third was a perfect blend of what made people like the first, with better special effects, clockwork humor and storytelling, and a real tour de force with the addition of Josh Brolin as young agent K. The end twist wraps up the trilogy wonderfully. You see the heart and soul of Men in Black is the chemistry between two agents fighting the absurd. I too was shocked to see a woman in black in the third, but it didn't shadowed the entire movie. I don't know why they tried to put a feminin touch to the franchise root, as I'll never understand why they did the same with Ghostbusters, but the issue here is not what they've tried, as bold as it may looks at first sight, but rather what they've accomplished : matching a Hollywood star with a rising one...and failed to make them enjoy the ride. The story is never gripping, the action is non inspiring, the drama is inexistant, and the stars were aligned for a bad omen in a science-fiction that doesn't know how to reinvent itself. Perhaps they should've made a MIB 4...because it doesn't feel international...it feels irrational."
Men in Black: International,23,66,audience,There is nothing good to say about this movie. Even too terrible to fall asleep to.
Men in Black: International,23,66,audience,Only good thing about this was my girl Tessa and Chris Hemsworth's looks.
Men in Black: International,23,66,audience,Well for one the Pug wasn't in this movie!! How is there going to be a MIB without the pug oh so disappointed. Second we're the he'll is will Smith at  SMH.
Men in Black: International,23,66,audience,"This movie was really fun! It had great action, and a cool script! I really liked Chris Hemsworth in this film as well! I am a big fan of the Men in Black films, so this was a really good pick! The creatures were all fun and cool, and the movie had great effects! Some creatures were a little more creepy than others, but I wouldn't say there's anything here that could disturb young children! It does feel different without Will Smith, and Tommy Lee Jones! However, overall a fun film!"
Men in Black: International,23,66,audience,both actors have good comedic timing but it's unoriginal 
Men in Black: International,23,66,audience,That had to be the laziest reboot I’ve ever seen.
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
Unless there is a mass neuralization of audiences Men in Black: International will not make us forget the charms of the first MIB film.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
Practically all of the laughs are little ones.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
The magic, humor, and chemistry is missing between Hemsworth and Thompson confirming that three sequels are too many.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
To quote Emma Thompson's character, Men in Black: International feels like a case of deja vu dismissed just as quickly.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
It's a decent film that never rises up to its potential.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
Thompson gets the best line in the film. The problem is, the British dame is in it for less than five minutes, bookending with brilliance a sluggish two-hour slog that sinks into stupidity without her.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
A fourth installment that is mindless enough to pass the time but has no real reason for existing. Why on Earth did this franchise need to continue?
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
It's the definition of 'nothingness.'
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
The easy friendship between Hemsworth and Thompson is what keeps the audience going to the end.

Hemsworth's character is irritating and impossible to empathize with. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
The whole thing runs like clockwork, with nothing unexpected, nothing to provoke strong emotion ... Nothing sticks in the mind, because nothing sticks out at all.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
But it takes more than two charming leads to make a great film-you actually need a strong script.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
MIB: I is an OK summer science fiction adventure movie. Trouble is, it's not a good Men in Black movie.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
A Men in Black movie without Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones is like cereal without the milk.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
There are some jokes that don't land, and the tone can be unbalanced, but overall, this is an enjoyable buddy cop film that takes its characters around the world.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
A failure on almost every creative level and utterly dead on arrival. And outside of Nanjiani's character, it isn't all that funny either.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
Men In Black: International is forced to juggle both story arcs, and in a not-so-compelling fashion.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
But once you've defined what a ""Men In Black alien"" looks like, you've lost that oddball little spark that made it great to begin with.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
[T]his new adventure misses the chance to be edgier and stand out from the pack.
 "
Men in Black: International,23,66,critic,"
It's not a great film, and it's not even what I would consider to be a 'good' one. But, it's not meant to be. It's a fun romp through the galaxy, and Hemsworth and Thompson play off of each other beautifully.

Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,audience,Great movie made by fans for fan absolutely a fun monster film a shame that there was no wide shot fights Scene or really good scene of monsters causing city destructions but this is by far one of my favorite movies in the Godzilla Franchise!
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,audience,buena accion buenos efectos especiales pero falla en mostrar a los monstruos de la pelicula osea se llama Godzilla el rey de los monstruos  deve de estar mas enfocado en el y en las ecenas de  los humanos sino mas en el combate que las personas espero que en la siguiente pelicula  Kong vs Godzilla .
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,audience,"I wasn't a huge fan of 2014's GODZILLA, but the trailer and special effects for the sequel had my interest. Overall, I felt about the sequel much the same I felt about the first one: the storyline was meh but the effects were good. So depending on how you enjoyed the 2014 installment, will determine how you enjoy this year's release."
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,audience,"I hate humans in this kind of movies, and that teen girl is the worst thing about this movie"

Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,audience,"After Godzilla (2014), Godzilla: King of the Monsters' answer to the audience's demand to see more monster and less human drama is bloated, overlong and noisy. The CGI and photography are also a noticeable step down from its predecessor."
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,audience,"That movie is ugly, i don't see any monster fight, the cam is shake all time, the characters don't have personality. 
A low drama, the characters don't work, they are flat without emotions, the script have not sense, very hard to see a decent monsters fight. horrible camera zoom to Godzilla, that zoom of camera remember me an antique 70s movie Kung Fu. Godzilla King of monster or maybe King of nothing."
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,audience,"This film makes 2014's Godzilla look minimalist in comparison. There is just so much going on in this movie, and some of the ideas are pretty interesting, but others feel rushed and out of place (Atlantis? Really?). The CGI in this movie has also taken a drastic downturn from its predecessor - most of the monsters look like they were drawn by an edgy 14-year-old and it makes it really hard to take any of it seriously. The humor is all pretty forced and the movie flips arbitrarily between being aware of how goofy it is and taking itself far too seriously. There were a few decent scenes, and some of the monster fights are pretty engaging, but this whole film feels like a lazy action rip-off with no soul."
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
...exceedingly, distractingly slick...
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
It's difficult to know what could make Godzilla: King of the Monsters a truly enjoyable film, but a start would be to focus on what everyone wants to see - the monsters - and leave the tricky plot mechanics for pretty much any other movie.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
Godzilla: King of the Monsters is in 3D - Death, Destruction and Decibels - but has a certain kind of cheesy appeal.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
And listen, it's ridiculous. Godzilla: King of Monsters attempts to pack in so much bang, you forget why the fighting started in the first place. It's an action film on steroids.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
If you're happy to sit through scene after scene of utter nonsense to get to the next sequence with giant CGI creatures biting each other, then Godzilla: King of the Monsters may be for you ...
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
The story is a little bit of hollow it's a little bit orced... but - big but!- Godzilla makes up for it. The return of Godzilla and all of these friends is pretty amazing and pretty epic.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
An epitomic example of bombastic spectacle unable to overtake terrible storytelling.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
A surprisingly dull affair as far too much time is spent on a truly ridiculous plot involving the freeing of Godzilla's rivals and far too little on epic monster throw downs.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
After a subpar 2014 effort, Mike Dougherty keeps the focus on the monsters during this sequel, which makes for a lot of fun and a breezy pace.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
Doesn't make a lick of sense, but it has a lot of fun along the way.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
It is full of hollow characters that escape without scratching from any explosion, foreseeable situations that cause me to yawn and sequences of mass destruction that never leave redundancy. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
King of the Monsters is a solid, powerhouse kaiju story that even manages to find the time to make us like a couple of the human characters as well. That's a win in my monster book.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
Don't let naysayers put you off - Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a lot of fun and a bombastic salute to the franchise's history.

It's a never-ending assault on our visual, auditory, and common senses.

Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
Everything my soul needed: kaijus mercilessly destroying each other, destruction, an epic music score, cheesy lines, and beautiful cinematography. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
Godzilla: King of the Monsters ... [amps] up the monster action and even [gives] us a framing plot that's just as good as Kong and better than the one in Godzilla.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
Each monster, each crash, and each blow are so isolated that the film doesn't feel light on its feet but void of weight instead.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
I'll say this is probably going to be one of the best event movies of the year. It succeeds in the scale of what this movie should be and what fans hoped it would be.
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
Legendary Pictures seems to have heard the outcry of audiences everywhere and have seen fit to produce Godzilla: King of the Monsters, a film that knows no sense of the word 'restraint.'
 "
Godzilla: King of the Monsters,42,83,critic,"
Sure it's campy and a bit goofy but it's the right direction for these films and the right audience to target since Godzilla belongs to the monster kids, both young and old.
 "
Resident Evil,35,67,audience,"Exactly the right movie at exactly the right time. The music and atmosphere, the sets and costume design, the special effects, the cast. Everything lined up perfectly for a young shaggy. That kid was a gothy nerd with love for video-games, horror, industrial music and Mila Jovovich. This movie managed to check all the boxes. Watching it now, it still pretty much holds up. Maybe a little cheesy but stylish and entertaining. Three stars for watchability, one for nostalgia."
Resident Evil,35,67,audience,A bit weird but it ends up being fun and with that slight touch of terror
Resident Evil,35,67,audience,The first of the 5 or 6 movies in this franchise.  If you're up to not to much intellectual thought and wanna see the start of the zombie apocalypse then these flicks are up you alley.  Alice is a little to thin in my book but Mila is an attractive women and I guess with her and Alice with Jill Valentine in the oOther movies you can call them female bad ass movies.  I usually watch these with nights of insomnia.
Resident Evil,35,67,audience,What a snooze fest. Bad acting. Bad plot. Horrible movie.
Resident Evil,35,67,audience,Another video game adaption I enjoy. Its a good but cheesy movie.
Resident Evil,35,67,audience,Movie was alright. Has the Resident Evil feel to it.
Resident Evil,35,67,audience,B-Movie from the 2000's era that is of course chock-full of the string of problems that come with low-budget sci-fi action flicks. Jovovich is a stunning actress that can barely carry this kick-off to a billion dollar franchise.
Resident Evil,35,67,audience,"I originally watched ""Resident Evil"" at a movie theater when it was first released in 2002. I hadn't played the games. There was no Rotten Tomatoes and I didn't read reviews back then so I went in blind. And I utterly enjoyed the movie: the story, the action sequences, the underground ""Hive,"" Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kicking serious ass, and more. 

Panned by critics (36% RT) but liked by users (67% RT), Resident Evil was one of the first examples of how mainstream critics just don't ""get"" horror. Movies that try to be artsy get great reviews even as key elements fall flat for the rest of us. The recent ""Beach House"" is a perfect example of this -- it was loved by critics (81% RT) and panned by users (28%). 

Unfortunately, the rest of the ""Resident Evil"" sequels except for a few moments, rarely captured that first movie's originality and allure.  Instead, check out the writer/director's excellent previous outing ""Event Horizon."""
Resident Evil,35,67,audience,"I enjoyed this movie. I don't know about the sequels yet but this one was fun to watch. Casting and acting was okay except the main leading actress. Plot was simple but shown in effective way.  Horror element was also good, there are some jump elements also. What I liked about the movie was that it didn't show everything straight, it tried to create suspense.

Overall, would recommend this to anyone who loves zombie movies."
Resident Evil,35,67,audience,"The first resident evil movie is okay, it's a good movie on it's own but when you think of it as resident evil its disappointing. This movie has a okay plot and story, the cast is alright. The character of allice is fine in this movie. She isn't an over powerful over the top killing machine (which is something I hate about the character). The effects are dated, but the licker and the zombie dogs were pretty cool.

This movie did things that I didn't realize it did, made tons of references and had many Easter eggs related to the four major resident evil games at the time (the first 3 games and code veronica x). Now this movie could've been a thousand times better if they made it way more like the games. Hopefully the reboot tv show and possible movie can do the franchise the justice it deserves."

This routine video-game spinoff borrows heavily from James Cameron action flicks and George Romero zombie epics but doesn't do much else.

Despite a promising setup, pic never really goes anywhere, instead immersing viewers in a kinetic onslaught of flesh (namely, that of Milla Jovovich) and flesh-eaters (most of the rest of the cast).

Captive State,44,37,audience,Sequel bait bullsh*t. You’ve seen this type of thing before. Whole film could have been the first act.
Captive State,44,37,audience,I don’t understand all the hate this was a solid alien/sci fi movie . Coulda been better yea but to justify these bad ratings I don’t understand 3.4
Captive State,44,37,audience,A lot people say it bit confusing and they don't really know what they just saw .....I had to watch it twice to understand it; all I will say is pay attention William Mulligan's (John Goodman's) shirt as he descends and read text in the credits! I didn't the first time those final 10 seconds change the movie from 2 to 4 stars! John Goodman is Number 1 in this film; Well worth a watch; A Solid Sci-Fi Thriller!
Captive State,44,37,audience,How could anyone rate anything below 5 stars after hearing Stardust in the movie?
Captive State,44,37,audience,"This is a very cerebral movie. It's a movie for smart people, and that's probably why I thoroughly enjoyed it yet so many others did not. If you're in the mood for Christopher Nolan movie, but have watched them all, then watch Captive State. It's like a gritty Christopher Nolan movie with better sound mixing, and less special effects. It's a ghetto focused spy film with a Nazi extraterrestrial government that imposes martial law on the poor. If you hate the poor, hate movies with complex plots made for smart people, hate John Goodman and only like movies where something blows up every five seconds after a car chase then you will dislike this film."
Captive State,44,37,audience,Painful to sit through and terribly forgetful.

Captive State offers some unique and thoughtful concepts but lacks any sense of character or story to back it all up.
 "

I did not enjoy the process of watching this film.
 "
Captive State,44,37,critic,"
Featuring a truly great alien character design and at least 45 truly quality minutes, Captive State is a modestly entertaining affair with an aftertaste so delicious, you'll be frustrated the meal you ate didn't taste as good as your belch afterwards.
 "
Captive State,44,37,critic,"
There are some good ideas at the heart of Captive State and sometimes they work well. But too often, the good gets tangled and twisted up in unnecessary B-story and plotting that ruminates when it should be on the move.

Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,audience,I thought it was a cool take on a thriller. The beginning was kind of quirky and Jake gyllenthal's character was unique and interesting but the middle was boring with a lot of talking by rich pretentious assholes. The ending is when most of the cool stuff happens. And it definitely should have had a different title.
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,audience,"The Final Destination set in the art world no one was asking for. This could've actually gone pretty well based upon that premise, but its commentary is obvious and heavy handed, its plot is too meandering and uninteresting, and its purpose is uncertain. Jake Gyllenhaal saves his scenes for the most part with his typical charm, but in the end I found it hard pressed to not ask ""why did I watch this?"""
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,audience,Gylenhaal saves this movie from obscurity with memorable acting but the weak story and unsatisfying conclusion makes it better left unwatched.
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,audience,"I will rate this as one of the better Final Destination movies. Death is now Art, and the rules are: experience it and live, exploit it and die. With a game cast, this is pretty fun. In this scheming lot, John Malkovich is almost a good guy! If Toni Collette hadn`t been available, they would surely have gifted her part to either Patricia Clarkson or Tilda Swinton. It is that kind of movie.
""Real"" horror often comes apart near the end, but in this case tension increase and the set-pieces get better. That sphere! Someone must have seen Flash Gordon (1980) at a tender age. You sense Dan ""Nightcrawler"" Gilroy is but one step. should heart and head align, from making a really great movie."
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,audience,Wanna be high art movie but turned out kinda lame
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,audience,"An unique interesting premise, that's keeps you wanting to know more. Then you realize there is no more to know. Starts good falls flat"
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,audience,Bunch of horrible character from the art world stumble across a dead guy's works that somehow end up getting them all killed.
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,audience,Such a waste of time... Where does the curse art came from? That old guy make a deal with demon?? How doesn't it effect that robot and rene ruso screw tattoo on the neck since that is not curse art... Totally waste of time
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,audience,Terrible horrible cringe fest of a movie.
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,audience,"Well, it was really really promising, but, it ended up being a total disappointment. Yeah, it had potential, but it won't cause anyone nightmares, the film itself is a nightmare. I say this because it didn't work at mixing drama and horror, it had too much mistakes, illogical, and it became confusing (not in an interesting way) and boring."
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
While the pulpy, by-the-numbers horror of the film's second half has the potential to be something awfully fun, Velvet Buzzsaw's overwritten and unfocused script sucks the joy out of even the most ridiculous of deaths.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
Gilroy fictionally savages the corruption, careerism and vacuousness that pervades this field, including its most prestigious exhibitions, galleries, museums and journals and the thoughts and opinions of its leading figures.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
It's funny in fits and starts, but all feels pretty pointless in the end.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
The film leaps over important parts that build the tension or the audience and instead explains characters that don't make any sense to us and really in the end don't matter.

Once the heart of the story is exposed, the pace picks up and it becomes a ""Twilight Zone"" style of story.

[Velvet Buzzsaw] metamorphoses into one of those horror farces... the film is most effective the less it tries to sell itself as a luxury item. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
Grotesque, darkly funny, and immersive all at once, Velvet Buzzsaw is completely chaotic in the best possible ways.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
Any satire that may or may not be present is very quickly undermined by its performances, which push way too far in their attempts to critique flamboyant excess.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
Gilroy's attempt to show the horrors of the art world falls flat, and certainly doesn't live up to the expectations based on the success of Nightcrawler.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
While its inherent silliness offers plenty of moments of levity, it also risks trivialising its social commentary.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
The film is exhilarating when it frames its critique of art snobs who are at the mercy of thaumaturgical retaliation, in a puzzle that wields the mechanisms of supernatural horror and the most hidden slasher. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
[I]t's hard no to be enamored with the gonzo insanity on display.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
That writer and director Dan Gilroy tackles a subject so incredibly ripe for mockery but goes for the easiest, most tired clichés is quite disappointing.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
When the film morphs into a horror film it has a false ring.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
Riotously funny, fiendishly clever, and crackling with a creepy story of obsession.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
It's difficult to know exactly what Gilroy is going for amidst these hodge-podge of ideas.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
Because [Dan] Gilroy's satire is so harsh, and so arch, the movie lacks emotional impact. Not one of the characters feels remotely sympathetic.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
Instead of focusing on the horror of the moment, you have to spend a couple of minutes wondering if you completely missed a scene or if this is just a movie of very shoddy editing.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
Beyond a few good jokes and the reliability of its cast, the picture lacks the self-reflexivity to plumb its art/commercialization commentary.
 "
Velvet Buzzsaw,61,35,critic,"
But Velvet Buzzsaw's fatal flaw may be that it quickly shifts from satire... into an R.L. Stine Goosebumps plot.

Overlord,81,66,audience,A over the top bloodbath terror This War is a fun watch
Overlord,81,66,audience,"A fine watch with blood, gore and war."
Overlord,81,66,audience,"I don't understand all the good reviews for this movie. I went to see it with my best friend in theater when it came out based on all the good reviews on the internet. I love horror/fantasy/thriller/gore etc movies, i almost exclusivly watch this type of movies for the past 30 years. Hell, I even like war movies most of the time (cause it's another type of horror you might say)! 
My friend also like horror etc to a lesser extent and action movies... And we were both deeply disapointed on all front!
It was boring, it was cliché beyond belief both on the war and horror sides, no interesting characters or dialogue, no epic moment (worst final fight ever if you can even call it a fight) and i could go on and on...
It was kinda pretty and it goes boom sometimes. Does that make a good movie nowadays?
If this bs was made 20 years ago or more it'd be okay at best (aside the special effects). 
Are reviewers too young or uncultured in this genre ? Am i too old or did i watched too much ? What the hell ?
Only good thing out of this is that now when i want to know about the credibility of a reviewer on the web i just have to see what are there opinion on Overlord...
Thank you for reading and sorry for the rant, the reviews for this movie still makes me  crazy angry... and i was a professional critic for magazines a few years back so it should not affect me this way."
Overlord,81,66,audience,"This movie is awesome! From start to end! Edge of your seat action, Gore, mystery, thrilling, & action!! 
Won't be disappointed!"
Overlord,81,66,audience,"This wasn't my favorite movie.. but I have to say, the acting was absolutely terrific. The characters really came to life to tell a very unique story. It's certainly a weird movie, but it was told in a way that was very entertaining to watch. If you have an open mind and aren't afraid to see some things that are really messed up, you'll enjoy the acting and thrill of this movie."
Overlord,81,66,audience,"La película me pareció entretenida no hay muchos Zombies y eso me gusta aquí no nos ponen la estampida como en guerra mundial z, aquí solo, nos muestran 3 si contamos con el soldado nazi, el que estaba encerrado y cheis, tengo entendido que esta película iba hacer parte del universo cloverfield, sin en bargo j.j Abras desmintio esta teoria. en resume entretenida,terrot y no forma parte de universo cloverfield."
Overlord,81,66,audience,An exciting movie start to finish.
Overlord,81,66,audience,"Literally speaking, a Frankenstein between WWII movies and Resident Evil. COuld be somehow entertaining, but not a fine piece of art."
Overlord,81,66,audience,"Overlord is an surprisingly pleasant action film for me. I would say if you are looking for horror and amazing new levels of gore, this is not the movie for you. While I feel that it delivers on great uses of CGI/practical, action, fun characters, and a decent story, it is easy to see peoples criticism on the lack of focus and horror elements. The zombies are cool, they aren't used very often and when they are they feel threatening. Honestly something you don't see that often in zombie movies today. The WWII vibe is good, but if you are a war or history film buff, maybe not good enough. For being a b-list movie with a c-list cast it is quite enjoyable, and I had a lot of fun. Not anything revolutionary but a good attempt at it."
Overlord,81,66,audience,"I think I pee'd a little. Watch it, s'il vous plaît."
Overlord,81,66,critic,"
Overlord is a serious, scary, fun and gory sci-fi horror adventure. Good job I don't like my war films too real!

There's plenty of entertainment to be found in the undead mayhem, even if it could have benefitted from slightly more comic relief.

Overlord,81,66,critic,"
It was a fun ride... I just don't think it's for me.
 "
Overlord,81,66,critic,"
An unexpected genre blend - serving as part war drama and part zombie thriller, which reinvents the idea of the ""living dead"" into something we haven't quite seen before.
 "
Overlord,81,66,critic,"
You'll laugh, you'll squirm and you will be thrilled!
 "
Overlord,81,66,critic,"
It mostly juggles its inspirations instead, and its central conceit . . . is a trashily fun if not completely original gimmick, but it takes too long to show up.

Overlord,81,66,critic,"
B-Movie quality it is, which undoubtedly suits its tone. But it does beg the question, is it truly time to bury the Zombie genre?

Overall, Overlord is a smart film that blends war and horror together effortlessly, resulting in a truly terrifying experience.

Overlord delivers exactly what you are expecting. Nothing more; nothing less. And that's quite alright if you're looking for a horror-flavored action adventure.

 "
Overlord,81,66,critic,"
A violent, rapid-fire, predictable-but-entertaining delve into one of my favorite sub-subgenres of horror, the Nazi zombie story.
 "
Overlord,81,66,critic,"
Overlord is not only a killer genre shift film, but also a fantastic grindhouse throwback. The first half plays out like most WWII movies ... Once [one soldier] finds the lab, the horror kicks in and goes pretty much full throttle until the credits roll.
 "
Overlord,81,66,critic,"
And while race isn't overtly mentioned in Overlord, it shouldn't be taken lightly that, in this era of heightened racist rhetoric, the hero in this battle against Nazi supremacy is a black man. He's Jesse Owens with a gun.
 "
Overlord,81,66,critic,"
While occasionally cheesy, Overlord is an extremely solid World War II drama with a terrifying and exciting zombie twist. It'll keep you gripping the edge of your seat in suspense, and it delivers thrills in fresh and fun ways.
 "
Overlord,81,66,critic,"
Overlord has everything that anyone could want from a zombie nazi film. An exhilarating yet traumatic experience that will excite your every emotion with fear, fury and fire.
 "
Overlord,81,66,critic,"
Overlord is a visual and audible ecstasy for horror fans. The intense action sequences are jaw dropping and Overlord will likely be viewed as an explosive crowd-pleaser. However, the paper thin characters and stale acting leave a lot to be desired.

Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,audience,Excellent Casting all around
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,audience,"If there is one thing Freddie Mercury was seriously great on, was his charisma.
Rami Malek has the same charisma of a pair of second hand shoes.
I find the movie quite insulting to the memory of Mercury...he was magnificent and stylish while this movie is mediocre and under tone.
And I bet Deacon disapproved it.
Rotten."
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,audience,"Who wants to watch over 2 hours of a guy wearing Halloween buckteeth Karaoke Queen for over 2 hours? Apparently, the Academy"
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,audience,"Entertaining enough but far too much time was spent covering Freddy Mercury's sexuality and party lifestyle. I wish the film showed more of the other band members and felt a little less dramatised in places. The writing and pacing did let the film down and most of the characters weren't particularly likeable. However, the cinematography was on point, the music was enjoyable, the choreography and outfits were well done, and the acting was reasonable but nobody's best performance."
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,audience,"Objectively, this film may not be the greatest. But the way the story, the acting and the music all come together and flow just invokes a sensory overload which is bittersweet in the end, as the reality hits."
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,audience,"An absolute masterpiece! It blew me away, and had me in tears... all the while captivated and enraptured. Phenomenal"
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,audience,"A strong but unoriginal biopic. Good performances, Rami Malek is good as Freddie, but he lacks a little charisma. The music is well incorporated. The end in particular is really good."
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,audience,"A fascinating, entertaining and enjoyable glance into the life of Freddie Mercury and Queen, which will find you singing along to its recognizable soundtrack. The biopic tries to stick to Queen's timeline leading up until 1985, changing it only partly for cinematic effect. Due to its PG13 rating, it tones down Mercury's true lifestyle."
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,audience,Really fabulous film capturing the success of Freddy Mercury & Queen! Here was a film my husband and I both enjoyed. RIP Freddie. Heaven's band is getting some wonderful talent.
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,audience,behind the glamor the story is surprisingly shallow but enjoyable 
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
Bohemian Rhapsody tells the dramatised history of the influential British rock band, Queen, with the limelight focused firmly on the late frontman, Freddie Mercury.
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
So forceful and enthusiastic that it's hard not to get caught up in the momentum and the impact of one of the most enduring groups in rock history.

The high wire work of Malek and the thrilling concerts sequences will make you fall in love with Queen all over again. While far from perfect, Bohemian Rhapsody was a blast.
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
Thanks to the film's aesthetically pleasing musical sequences and Rami Malek's commanding leading performance, it still serves as an adequate reminder of both the band's musical genius and Freddie's one of a kind stage presence.

The film never really strikes an original note, choosing instead to tap into all the biopic high notes.

Rami Malek is the movie and the only reason why it stands out, not much beyond his acting. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
The film clearly has its flaws, rolling out more like a ""Greatest Hits"" compilation than a creative concept album, but the experience is so nostalgically infectious as to be irresistible. Forget the mixed reviews; they're just radio gaga.
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
More bubblegum pop than gritty heartbreaking drama, Bohemian Rhapsody may have a few flaws but it is, without a doubt, made for its hardcore fan base. It's engaging, foot-tapping and one all-around rocking respectful party.
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
The film is either scared of alienating its audience or can't bring itself to paint Mercury in a light that isn't totally mainstream, but either way, it's shallow.
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
Mercury's deeply flawed personality is brilliantly brought out in all its contradictions by Malek.
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
Bohemian Rhapsody was made to pay tribute to Freddie, not to explore his personal life. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
There are a great number of problems with Bohemian Rhapsody, but the passion for and behind the band is front and center, and that occasionally makes it a great deal of fun.
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
It is brutally long, rushing to tell the hectic life of Freddie Mercury with very awkward creative decisions and conventional mechanics that make the journey hasty, pointless and with little time for cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
As a biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody falls short, failing to adequately examine Mercury's life and the people in it. Malek, who put so much effort into bringing Mercury to life, and who gives such a brilliant performance, deserves better, as does the audience.
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
Overall, this is nothing new. Neither good nor bad, but if you approach it from the right angle, it's a lot of fun.
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
The film ends on a musical high, accurately capturing the essence of the band's energy but, despite Malek's best efforts, fails to capture the elusiveness of Freddie Mercury.
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
Bohemian Rhapsody dives into the struggles that Freddie Mercury went through. Whether you are a Queen fan or not, it makes for a great drama (with awesome music!).
 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
This is record label-approved hagiography, and those doing the approving seem to see Mercury's sexual orientation as a character flaw he must overcome.

Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"

 "
Bohemian Rhapsody,61,85,critic,"
Though Rami Malek (Mr Robot) obviously poured his heart into the role, he could never have won, given the source material he had to work with.

Summer of 84,72,67,audience,"Made me a little sleepy! Movie is straight forward and there are no twists and turns! You know what is going to happen, really!"
Summer of 84,72,67,audience,A Stranger Things esque 80's genre piece with a serial killer cop instead of the upside down.
Summer of 84,72,67,audience,"Summer of 84 is an amazing movie, which has that 80s feel to it. The last 25 minutes are so messed up and arguably, disturbing."
Summer of 84,72,67,audience,"THE WORST ENDING!!! 
*Spoiler alert*
-no happy ending! 
-the killer gets away and is never caught.
-UNSATISFACTORY AF"
Summer of 84,72,67,audience,"Half feel-good 80s nostalgia trip (think Stranger things)half dark twisted thriller/horror. 

This Canadian movie (albeit set in Oregon) had us both actually shocked. It sucks you in, then BANG!!!!
Low budget, but very well made, and god knows how it slipped under my radar but it's on Netflix and worth a watch. 

Goonies this certainly ain't."
Summer of 84,72,67,audience,"Una película genérica donde se utiliza la nostalgia que está muy de moda para enganchar espectadores, desgraciadamente pocos saben hacer esto de manera efectiva, y cuando no se hace bien se nota ése chantaje barato y se vuelven obvias la poca creatividad, el guion hecho a la ligera donde no hay una conexión con los personajes ya que hemos visto ésta premisa tantas veces en los últimos 10 años que ya no sorprende a nadie.
Inmediatamente empezamos a comprar un personaje con otro de una serie o una película y lo mismo pasa con la historia, todo nos recuerda a algo desafortunadamente a algo hecho con más calidad, y ahí es donde la película pierde toda su posible fortaleza.
¿Para que perder el tiempo con imitaciones si pueden disfrutar de algo de mejor calidad? Esa es la realidad de éste filme."
Summer of 84,72,67,audience,"I really enjoyed Summer of 84! Even though the ending was a little off, but still good nostalgic fun. Good concept, good execution!"
Summer of 84,72,67,audience,"Although there weren't any real surprises here (we've seen this movie before), the characters were likeable enough to carry this film. There are a bunch of ""as if"" moments that take away from the film as a whole, but it was still a fun ride."
Summer of 84,72,67,audience,"Mix of stranger things, hardy boys and serial killer documentaries. Very fun and entertaining. Great sound and set design, but ending was a little dragged out."
Summer of 84,72,67,audience,"A quite powerful ending,"
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
Summer of '84 does many things well. The suspense set pieces are well-staged. The young cast gives convincing performances.
 "
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
It does many things wrong, but the twist is so good, it redeems a large part of the film. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
It's a unsatisfying, hollow, and frankly dull attempt at nostalgic throwback horror that lacks any authenticity, earnestness, or energy.

It's a good movie.
 "
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
I really think that the ending makes this movie great.
 "
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
Fun in the moment but all too ugly up close in memory. The 80s, am I right? It excelled at that.
 "
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
There were moments when I was roused by myriads of sly wit, suspicion and even shock, and others when I felt sad for kids who might have endured better by leaving the searches to others.
 "
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
Despite the film's character flaws, a twisted ending that viewers won't see coming helps elevate it.
 "
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
...meanders for most of its run time and by the time the film goes somewhere interesting, it's already too late
 "
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
Summer of '84 is an unexpected wonder. A nostalgic movie that, paradoxically, advocates with passion about the dangers of nostalgia. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
While the kids-on-bicycles story may be a bit tired, the night drive-inspired synth score, the summer-break friendship dynamic, and the central story all add up to an irresistible and highly entertaining movie.
 "
Summer of 84,72,67,critic,"
It definitely gets a little gory by the end but I thought it was a good little horror movie with some genuine scares.

Upgrade,88,87,audience,Great idea. great execution. Great writing. Great action. Violent af. Great acting. Great camera work. Amazing ending. If you're reading this just go watch it already.
Upgrade,88,87,audience,Choreography and cinematography was unique and purposefully had a robotic feel to it.
Upgrade,88,87,audience,"Great thriller with good acting and amazing visuals considering the budget. A must watch for anyone who enjoys the ""cyberpunk genre""."
Upgrade,88,87,audience,A bit boring at the beginning but it just keeps getting better until the end until it just couldn't get any better.
Upgrade,88,87,audience,Son yıllarda izlediğim (2018-2021) en başarılı filmlerden birisidir. Çekimleri ile aksiyonu doruklarına kadar hissedebiliyorsun. Hikayesi de muhteşem ilerliyor.
Upgrade,88,87,audience,"A violent, action-packed and fun-filled ride. By the end, you'll either be silently admiring this film or screaming in excitement."
Upgrade,88,87,audience,"For an indie film, this is a really great execution of a very well developed idea. The action is violent and morbidly funny, and done in a way that is also really dependent on how good Logan-Marshall Green's acting is, and he is fantastic. Extra points for not giving us a nice, mainstream ending and sticking to it's indie roots."
Upgrade,88,87,audience,"Entretenida de principio a fin, una interesante mirada a como puede ser el futuro."
Upgrade,88,87,audience,buena pelicula entretenida 7/10
Upgrade,88,87,audience,"This was a awesome movie, have watched multiple times."
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
The kind of pulpy, low-pretense, non-franchise thriller that bigger studios have done their best to usher toward extinction.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
With its emphasis on technology, slightly futuristic setting, and fondness for disturbing developments, Upgrade feels like an episode of Black Mirror that somehow managed to break free from its Netflix surroundings and emerge unscathed on the big screen.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
Upgrade is the best of revenge thrillers mixed with a masterfully creative futuristic world.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
Upgrade may not stick to your ribs like classic action movies but it's scarily effective in the moment.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
There's a remarkable amount of cleverness in this dark, chaotic vision of the future, blending believable technology with fantastical notions of science-fiction.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
Certain pieces of this old motor may have some screws loose, but there's mileage to be had, assuming the viewer can switch their brain between manual and automatic.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
It's unusual to find a movie this thrilling, up-to-date, and intellectually provocative in equal parts.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
The film's only true objective is to rev your engines, get your adrenaline pumping, and your heart racing. It's far from a perfect movie, but that didn't stop me from loving the experience I had watching it.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
pgrade never really takes hold of its audience as it fails to really engage on an emotional or visceral level, as it attempts to channel some of the best of 80s action cinema.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
There are a few rough edges to Upgrade - the editing could be more crisp, for example - but this is a story that ripples with adrenaline and clever plotting.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
Upgrade is a fun action-filled science-fiction film that may make some think about how much technology one really needs while entertaining them.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
Upgrade is much more than the sum of its parts, is as enjoyable as hell and taps into all of those innovative sci-fi movies that you already love without being a mere copycat.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
""Upgrade"" could have been just a B-picture, albeit an expensively-produced one, but [Leigh] Whannell is as serious about his social commentary as he is about entertaining us.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
Upgrade is some diverting if unexceptional entertainment. I mean, consider this alone: a 95-minute sci-fi action movie. Upgrade does indeed hail from a simpler time.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
With unbelievable action sequences, jaw-dropping bloodshed, and a surprisingly unique climax, Upgrade is sci-fi body horror at its most dynamic and raw. If John Wick was rewired to star in a superior version of Hardcore Henry, you'd get Upgrade.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
The risky, impressive and very effective plans and camera's work of the director join the performance of Logan Marshall-Green. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
...a wickedly funny, unassumingly smart, and ultra gory slice of cyberpunk.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
Wildly inventive, brutally violent and glossily designed
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
A brutal and brilliant film. Whannell has made an extraordinaryly compelling near future vision, with hilarious violence and fine performances. This is the film you'll be telling everyone to see this year.
 "
Upgrade,88,87,critic,"
Combining sci-fi smarts and grindhouse gore, this retro-futuristic thriller sees Australian writer-director Leigh Whannell deliver a heady dose of cyberpunk paranoia and some jolting shots of pulp-movie violence.

The Nun,24,35,audience,Meh kinda weird and awful
The Nun,24,35,audience,whoever made this film better hide their nan cos i'm on my way to kneecap her.
The Nun,24,35,audience,this is one of the weakest films in the conjuring universe. the scares don't work that well and I found it slightly boring.
The Nun,24,35,audience,Why im so done man uh
The Nun,24,35,audience,"This movie coulde have been more, but is not. It is not terrifying at all and the jump scares are predictable. Worst than the jump scares is what you learn by watching the movie: it doesn't tell you anything about the characters, nothig about Valak and almost nothing about the convent."
The Nun,24,35,audience,"La promocionaban como el capitulo mas oscuro del universo del conjuro, y si lo fue literalmente, porque en toda la película, no se podía ver casi nada, además si Irene los salvo a todos de Valak, para que introducían innecesariamente al personaje del padre Burke y de Franchie?"
The Nun,24,35,audience,An unneeded spin off once again but if we get a sequel (please no) hopefully its better like annabelle was.
The Nun,24,35,audience,It's not actually that bad. I found it entertaining to watch.
The Nun,24,35,audience,The Nun is so focused on scares that it ends up sinking in history.
The Nun,24,35,audience,"I don't know why this film's rating is so low.  I didn't think it was so bad.  Sure, there are plot holes aplenty, but the title character is genuinely creepy and there are some scary scenes."
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
Here's the thing. If there's a door in your abbey that reads 'God Ends Here' it's best to leave it closed. Burke and Co. could have done everyone, especially the audience, a favour by leaving well enough alone.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
The backstory to the creepy demon who bothered Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring 2, etc: in 1952, a priest and a novice nun are sent to Romania to investigate the apparent suicide of a young nun and the abbey in general. Disappointing.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
At its best, horror marks you. At its worst, it wastes your time and $12. The Nun, sure as all that is holy, does not leave a mark.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
While The Nun isn't good, it isn't quite as bad as its reputation.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
Don't look for salvation from The Nun...
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
This prequel's casting of Farmiga's sister is the only striking resemblance, as ""The Nun"" converts a once stellar franchise into a bad habit.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
For all its disappointment, it's unlikely The Nun will be the last we see of this bad habit as long as those staggering numbers remain undead.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
The Nun positions itself as slow-burning, self-aggrandizing horror, but it's too lifeless to engage. In fact, it's like looking through the windows of a pop-up Halloween store.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
The Nun runs into a lot of the same problems that 2014's Annabelle did. The build up to these characters seemed more terrifying than what they were given in their actual movies.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
The Nun wastes the efforts put into the set design and art direction with a lackluster story and substandard scare scenes.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
The Nun feels more like a missed opportunity than a complete disaster, but in the end, it's tough to tell the difference.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
The Nun nonetheless proves to be the weakest entry in the series so far, and next to Annabelle, that's saying something.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
If you're ready to kick off horror season a few weeks early, there are lots of opportunities to do better than this tedious nun-sense.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
The pleasant surprise about this very silly movie: how old-school hokey those chills are. The scare scenes and even the style of the acting wouldn't seem at all out of place in a Mario Bava Italian horror picture of the '60s.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
If you simply enjoy being scared for the sake of it and not worrying about much else, The Nun can still be a lot of fun.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
[T]his sequel/prequel doesn't have the seriousness of the previous four films. It also has issues with logic, consistency of tone, and character development.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
The Nun isn't exactly a missed opportunity, then, so much as it's a waste of an interesting filmmaker's talents.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
Towards the end, The Nun tries to beef up its plot and eventually connects it to the rest of the franchise, but its sins are too many to ever make it interesting.
 "
The Nun,24,35,critic,"
The nun is a very discreet horror film that quickly depletes its ideas and has a script full of weaknesses. [Full Review in Spanish]

The Nun,24,35,critic,"
Not being high gastronomy, the new spin off of the Warren universe fools with a moderately decent presentation. [Full Review in Spanish]

Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,audience,highly reccamend finnish film. and it's only first original anti-hero. well done on storytelling and i own this on bluray. can't wait for the sequal.
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,audience,"Complete and utter garbage, and how this crap is getting a sequel is beyond me. Apparently there are enough people with no judgment or taste in movies in the world."
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,audience,"Rendel could very well have been a revisionistic vigilante drama about corporate greed and urban crisis, yet its daffy script and bleakness mixed in with cheap genre tropes add up to a parody...not of the good variety though."
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,audience,145M Euro to make this thing? No special effets. The story is bad. Someone left with 130M in his car trunk during the making of this movie.
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,audience,"DOMMAGE QUE RENDEL SOIT UNE RATÉ AU NIVEAU SCÉNARISTIQUE CAR IL Y AVAIT UN TRÈS BON POTENTIEL MAIS QUI EST MALHEUREUSEMENT GÂCHÉ. LE FILM PROPOSANT UN CÔTÉ PLUS SOMBRE QUE SES HOMONYMES DE MARVEL, ON PEUT ESPÉRER QUE ÇA IRA EN S'AMÉLIORANT S'IL Y A D'AUTRES FILMS AVEC LE MÊME PERSONNAGE."
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,audience,"This is everything I've ever wanted in a superhero movie! As a huge superhero fan, I'd been hyped to see this since it was first announced. Most of the dialogue is Finnish, but subtitled in English. It's a simple revenge plotline, with simple characters and generic bad guys, but it's the ultra violent, dark, gritty superhero movie we've been waiting for!"
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,audience,"The film is visually stunning. While the script is slow and choppy at points, which I chalked up to the translation, but this is made up by the action. This film is brutal in spots, but that's what I liked about it. If you are looking for a great ride and like your movies violent, this is your movie."
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,audience,"Rottentomattoes don't have the infomation for this movie but if anyone wanted to watch this movie please don't the movie is uttery crap where they try to copy some superheroes but failed ,lowbudget movie =-= ."
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,audience,"""Rendel"" is visually stunning but its story, although grounded, doesn't present anything new to the superhero film genre. Rendel is badass, broody & violent & kicks ass from the beginning to the end of the film but nothing else really happens."
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,audience,"The most equally superhero film of all time is above all, a visual experience."
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,critic,"
A badly executed and crude cartoon of an idea, that falls way short of the mark.
 "
Rendel: Dark Vengeance,,27,critic,"
With Rendel, we have a much darker and violent superhero, oblivious to what we get used to from Hollywood, but with some details that hinder their first act. [Full Review in Spanish]

The Equalizer 2,51,61,audience,"god aweful. amazing 180 from GREAT first film, predictable, and final fight scene was just stupid."
The Equalizer 2,51,61,audience,Not as good as the original and the plot was lost towards the end without really giving the audience any insight on who the bad guys were working for! Maybe a 3rd installment? Anyway not a bad romp to pass the time but there definitely better films out there
The Equalizer 2,51,61,audience,"Supported by a wonderfully commanding performance by Denzel, this movie never fails to entertain. Well not quite as good as its predecessor the movie still delivers. An excellent supporting cast helps"
The Equalizer 2,51,61,audience,"Not terrible, not as good as the first. I really wanted this to be better. "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,audience,This was absolutely fantastic
The Equalizer 2,51,61,audience,"Better than the original, but still too long for what it is "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,audience,"Spoilers ahead. Up until the part where his former team becomes the enemy, the film was A+. The dark turn and unbelievable sequence of events turned this first-half A+ film into a B-rated at best. Completely forgettable. I'm not sure I've seen a film climb a high mountain and soar so high...only to have the movie lose its engines and wings at the same time. The result is a disaster second half and ending. A catastrophic plane wreck with no survivors."
The Equalizer 2,51,61,audience,"Slow, cumbersome, and not a patch on the original."
The Equalizer 2,51,61,audience,Despite mixed reviews it is quite entertaining with some good acting and interesting characters. A bit fantastical but hey so what.
The Equalizer 2,51,61,audience,"Quite predictable, but entertaining nonetheless. The acting was really good and the characters were well done too."
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
A solidly entertaining popcorn flick with pretensions of bringing Shakespearean level of pathos to the tale of vengeance.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
The Equalizer 2 is another blockbuster to join all the other summer sequels in box office heaven.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
The revelations are entirely predictable and the assemblage of villains serve only as fodder for ruthless slaughtering.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
I can't tell you to pay $12 dollars to see this movie, not with all the other goods currently in theaters.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
A better film because Denzel's in it.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
The Equalizer 2 lectures its audience about the importance of life itself -- and then pulls a gun on whatever importance might exist.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
Fuqua and company trade in the vicious streak that made the first film so gleefully mean for ho-hum tedium.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
There are probably one or two too many subplots that don't really amount to much, but any excuse to see this actor try on different hats as the same character is pretty exciting. This is a mild recommendation.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
Fuqua's direction is slick but generally uninspired.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
This might not be a great piece of awards-bait filmmaking but it is a rather enjoyable movie.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
While not reinventing the wheel of modern-day action thrillers, if viewers liked the first film, this new outing may provide similar feelings once the end credits roll.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
And through it all, the noise and the quiet, [Denzel] Washington dominates, even surrounded by a group of terrific supporting players.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
Not bad, but why does Denzel make a transition in the first movie to this one from a once hardened military soldier into a disheveled dopey guy that likely doesn't know how to comb his hair? It just started to go in a weird direction.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
The Equalizer was a satisfying action yarn, but this sequel offers few similar pleasures.

A film with characters that we care about, a spectacular, violent and intelligently action, and an impeccable Denzel Washington. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
Washington's first sequel is likely to be remembered for that trivia nugget and almost nothing else. It's the kind of movie so confused that Ta-Nehisi Coates' work is repeatedly name checked but the film also stops for a respectability politics lecture.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
One can't help but feel that The Equaliser 2 could have exploited the taxi driver set-up in a more intense manner akin to Collateral.
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
A sequel only in name and not by nature, The Equalizer 2 doesn't differentiate itself from any number of the countless male-driven action projects doing the rounds these days
 "
The Equalizer 2,51,61,critic,"
Yes, the plot is very much B-movie fare, but the star brings his A-game.

This isn't the feel-good movie of the year ... You may find yourself crying over imaginary dinosaurs. It's OK. It happens to the best of us.

This latest endeavor suggests that a never-ending series of monotonous, formulaic, CG-heavy blockbusters will be all that this property has in store for the future.
 "
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,47,48,critic,"
The script is downright terrible with horrible dialogue and unrealistic actions taken by the characters. Yes, it's about dinosaurs, but you still want some sense of plausibility.

The film disappointed me and my modest thumbs down comes with the acute awareness that I'm someone who sees far more films than the average human being.

There's no excuse for a movie with dinosaurs to be so painfully dull and dreary.

The chronicle of a hoax

Abstract

The Mole Agent (by Netflix)

This documentary follows in the footsteps of Sergio, an eighty-something man hired by a detective agency to infiltrate a nursing home as a resident and investigate how the mother of an agency client hospitalized there is treated.

What is real, fictional or metafictional in this documentary? How far are documentary makers willing to go to film that and those they investigate? What are the ethical limits?

Unfortunately, the entire agent mole is mounted on a hoax. More than an infiltrator from a detective agency, the ""agent"" Sergio is an infiltrator of the director, who changes the focus and begins to be interested in the dialogues and testimonies of the deceived elderly women of the nursing home.

   I finished watching this documentary with a feeling of discomfort close to indignation: that of having witnessed a disloyal invasion of the privacy of a group of elderly women to display their pain and serve as instruments of the director and her cinematographic device, of an experiment. And with the perplexity that hardly anyone has raised these ethical questions or downplayed them, especially the critics and festival juries.

Review

A lady (who does not appear on camera) hires the services of a detective agency to find out how they treat her mother, admitted to a nursing home. This documentary follows in the footsteps of Sergio, an eighty-something man hired by the agency to infiltrate the nursing home as a resident and carry out the investigation.

This documentary by the Chilean Maite Alberdi raises numerous elements for analysis and debate, some frankly uncomfortable.

What is real, fictional or metafictional in this documentary? How far are documentary makers willing to go to film that and those they investigate? What are the ethical limits?

I have read notes about how this documentary was filmed and a report to its director that were far from reassuring me.

The detective agency and its director are real, as well as the casting they carry out to choose Sergio as a mole. The ""mission"" entrusted to him is also real. The nursing home had previously accepted the presence of cameras for the filming of a documentary.

But unfortunately the entire Mole Agent is mounted on a hoax. More than an infiltrator of the detective agency, Sergio is an infiltrator of the director, who changes the focus and begins to be interested in the dialogues and testimonies that he generates with the elderly women in the nursing home. And like any mole, he deceives about his identity and his goals to all the companions who begin to bond with him, who by the way is a charming person.

To what extent do these women know that what they express (and to an impostor) is being filmed? Frail people, some of them already with signs of cognitive decline.

The detective moments are hilarious and the dialogues with the old ladies range from the picturesque to the moving.
But the purpose of this whole montage is not clear to me:
1) Reflect the daily life of a nursing home?
2) Give a voice to people who generally don't have it?
3) A testimony to sensitize the audience about how the elderly in general suffer in these institutions of loneliness, depression and abandonment by their families? Is this really a novelty?

    I finished watching this documentary with a feeling of discomfort close to indignation: that of having witnessed a disloyal invasion of the privacy of a group of elderly women to display their pain and serve, in short, as instruments for showing off the director and his cinematic device, from an experiment. And with the perplexity that almost no one has raised these ethical questions or minimizes them, starting with the critics and the festival juries.

And my feeling remains the same.

Reseña

Una señora (que no aparece en cámara) contrata los servicios de una agencia de detectives para averiguar cómo tratan a su madre, internada en un geriátrico. Este documental le sigue los pasos a Sergio, uno señor de ochenta y pico contratado por la agencia para infiltrarse en el geriátrico como residente y llevar adelante la investigación.

Este documental de la chilena Maite Alberdi plantea numerosos elementos para el análisis y el debate, algunos francamente incómodos.

¿Qué es real, ficcional o metaficcional en este documental? ¿Hasta dónde están dispuestos a llegar los documentalistas para filmar aquello y a aquéllos que investigan? ¿Cuáles son los límites éticos?

He leído notas acerca de cómo se filmó este documental y un reportaje a su realizadora que distaron de tranquilizarme.

La agencia de detectives y su director son reales, así como el casting que realizan para elegir a Sergio como topo. También es real la ""misión"" que le encomiendan. El geriátrico ya había aceptado previamente la presencia de cámaras para la filmación de un documental.

Pero lamentablemente todo El agente topo está montado sobe un engaño. Más que un infiltrado de la agencia de detectives, Sergio es un infiltrado de la directora, que cambia el foco y comienza a interesarse por los diálogos y testimonios que él va generando con las ancianas del geriátrico. Y como todo topo, engaña acerca de su identidad y sus objetivos a todas las compañeras que empiezan a vincularse con él, que por cierto es una persona encantadora.

¿En qué medida saben estas mujeres que lo que expresan (y a un impostor) está siendo filmado? Personas frágiles, algunas de ellas ya con signos de deterioro cognitivo.

Los momentos detectivescos son graciosos y los diálogos con las ancianas van de lo pintoresco a lo conmovedor.
Pero no me queda claro el objetivo de todo este montaje:
1)	¿Reflejar la cotidianeidad de un geriátrico?
2)	¿Darles voz a personas que en general no la tienen?
3)	¿Un testimonio para sensibilizar a la audiencia acerca de cómo los ancianos y ancianas en general sufren en estas instituciones de soledad, depresión y abandono por parte de sus familiares? ¿Es esto realmente una novedad?

    Terminé de ver este documental con una sensación de incomodidad cercana a la indignación: la de haber presenciado una desleal invasión a la privacidad de un grupo de ancianas para exhibir su dolor y servir, en definitiva, como instrumentos para el lucimiento de la directora y de su dispositivo cinematográfico, de un experimento. Y con la perplejidad de que casi nadie se haya planteado estas cuestiones éticas o las minimicen, empezando por los críticos y los jurados de los festivales.

Y mi sensación sigue siendo la misma.

The Mole Agent,94,89,audience,"Exijo el oscar para #agentetopo unhermoso pero desgarrador documental sobre el abandono a los ancianos una película que te pega y te pega durísimo en el corazón , don Sergio el personaje principal es un ser maravillo"
The Mole Agent,94,89,audience,"There is no doubt that there is tenderness, joy and fun moments in this movie. The big problem that I have is that I can't help but feel  that this isn't right. Making an overly complicated lie in order to show the lives of these people and make this ""story"" happen. At the elderly expense, without their permission. I really thing the line is closer to laughing at them than with them.

Probably the best example that proves my point is when the protagonist starts questioning why is he in here doing what he is doing. You can sense in his anger that he feels something isn't right."
The Mole Agent,94,89,audience,"At the rythm of old age it flows from some entertainig comedy and premise toward a more poetic, thinkful stance that allows to reflect and cathart on our very own reliotionships with our elderly."
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
This spy [is] more charming than Bond. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
A kind of senior citizen driven spy film combined with a documentary. Not kidding. And it is fun.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
In an era when the pandemic has shone a light onto the elderly and the care system, The Mole Agent is a particularly compelling piece of cinema.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
What a wonderfully moving film. Endearing and poignant in equal measure, Chilean director Maite Alberdi takes an outlandish premise and effortlessly extracts plenty of humour out of it, ultimately finding deep meanings when she least expects it.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
The early scenes suggest that some very iffy ethics are at play... Soon, however, The Mole Agent transforms into something else -- a far more contemplative and altogether humane account of life in a Chilean care home.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
There are no horror stories, just lots of poignancy.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
We didn't get a James Bond film in 2020, but who needs one when we have Maite Alberdi's charming hybrid drama-documentary.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
A fun little diversion, but nothing more.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
Sergio himself has real gentleness and is a lovely character, and there is some amiable comedy about how he is starting to enjoy himself in the home. But he is marooned in a tricksy, gimmicky film.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
A moving exploration of the realities of growing old, Maite Alberdi's documentary effectively blends documentary with dramatic elements to charming, if not always transparent, effect.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
A brilliantly conceived documentary which tackles issues around loneliness and how, as a society, we treat our elderly.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
Through a unique premise and an engrossing style, The Mole Agent shines a light on a part of our society that we don't talk or think about enough.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
It's so much more than a whodunnit, and all but the hardest hearts will fall in love with its spirited group of characters who have so much left to give.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
What starts as a charming espionage story, turns into an excellent reflection on the treatment that society gives to its elderly population. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
It's brilliantly executed and structured.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
Docu-drama about a kind man skilled in listening who goes undercover in a nursing home.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
One of the most important things art -- especially narrative art -- can do is inspire us to show empathy for others... Chilean filmmaker Maite Alberdi's documentary The Mole Agent is a heartwarming testament to this type of kindness.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
What I missed in the trailer-and, honestly, one could almost miss in the film itself-is the detail that elevates it to an entirely different level of fascination: The Mole Agent is a documentary.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
The Mole Agent is an incredibly endearing if not heartbreaking film.
 "
The Mole Agent,94,89,critic,"
The line between recreation and cinema vérité is deliberately unclear, and yet the message is unshakable-elderly people deserve more dignity than they get, and the loneliness they face is a tragedy.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
Jacinta is a powerful film about the seemingly unbreakable cycle of addiction and trauma across three generations.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
The film repeatedly cuts between old home movies and photographs of the younger Jacinta and Rosemary and present-day footage of Caylynn to highlight how they aren't all that different from each other-and how fragile innocence is.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
A new standard in documentary access shows a way out of cyclical intergenerational addiction but at a high cost.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
It's a devastating piece of supremely courageous filmmaking.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
If Jacinta is overtly about any one topic, in fact, that topic is family, not addiction.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
It's hard to watch, but also hard to look away.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
Earnshaw has made a deeply emotional and poignant film on the personal, familial horrors of addiction.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
A searingly honest portrait of kinship and addiction.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
""Jacinta"" is perceptive and persuasive. But it comes into its real, peculiar power as a portrait of a young woman trying to be a better mother than the mother she worships...
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
Earnshaw doesn't shy away from the fundamentals of Jacinta's situation and her relationship with addiction.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
Even if Earnshaw's cinematography wasn't often stunning, her ability to visualize how the harshest confinement doesn't require bars makes the film a must-see.
 "
Jacinta,100,,critic,"
[Earnshaw's] filmmaking is direct, honest, and compassionate, and her debut film portends more great things ahead for her.
 "
She Had a Dream,,,critic,"
Effortlessly balancing the personal and the political - and the invisible line between them - the filmmaker offers a glimpse into the future of a better Tunisia through Binous's unique odyssey.
 "
She Had a Dream,,,critic,"
Binous' determination to be an agent of change lends the film an engaging, upbeat energy that enhances its appeal...

[Ramona S.] Diaz's doc offers a sobering reminder that a free and independent press can never be taken for granted.
 "

A Thousand Cuts allows for people outside the intricacies of Filipino politics to be able to relate the nation's political climate to their own.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
Thought-provoking docu about freedom of the press.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
If you care about freedom of the press and democracy, it's a film you have to see.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
It's a fascinating movie on many, many levels.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
Although A Thousand Cuts focuses specifically on the Philippines, the documentary also serves as a dire warning that other democracies could face the same problems if they're not careful.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
Diaz stays out of the way of her own lens, instead giving a portrait in context of Ressa's valiant struggle for truth, and her determination to simply do the job even as she becomes part of the story.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
The film's broad scope also serves to further underline its title - the cuts it references aren't just being made in one place, but all over the body politic.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
Suspenseful and depressing...
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
Diaz has crafted a portrait of an insidious leader who believes in shutting down 'fake news', bullying detractors and happily putting others to death (by his own hands or by decree).
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
[I]]t brings attention to the civil rights abuses occurring now in the Philippines, smartly implying how this illiberalism could happen elsewhere.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
Exactly how many cuts are left?
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
As the film focuses more tightly on her, it becomes a more gripping document. And it certainly is gripping, as the cloud of menace threatening her becomes firmer.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
In doing so, ""A Thousand Cuts"" is a fascinating - and at times, horrifying - demonstration of the power of social media.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
Freedom of the press have never been more challenged than right now all across the globe. Thank Goodness for journalists like Maria Ressa who never let up and risk her own freedom by any means necessary. A Thousand Cuts Bleeds with the truth...period.
 "
A Thousand Cuts,100,83,critic,"
The information is bracing but often it is Maria Ressa herself who makes this documentary so electrifying to watch.

White Noise,87,72,audience,"The first feature-length documentary by The Atlantic shines as it exposes the darkness behind the alt-right movement. Through the focus on 3 of its prominent figures, Director Daniel Lombroso allows the viewer to consider its political influence, dissonance, and fear-driven hatred.

Never is there a dull moment as every dialogue, interview, and video graphic feels intentional. From beginning to end, the film is as harrowing as it is enthralling."
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
The film's subjects are humanised to a degree, which is a consequence of allowing them to hang themselves, but no-one can come out of this documentary thinking these people are justified in their spite.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
White Noise is unnerving viewing but surprisingly offers comfort by revealing the diminishing influence of some dangerous individuals.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
In the end it's clear that these figures are much more interested in their own popularity and wealth than any principles or personal beliefs,
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
It's not a pleasant watch - at times it feels as though Lombroso's fly on the wall approach is gradually peeling off the bandages on a gangrenous wound. But it's important and timely.

Docu highlights leaders of the alt-right movement; language.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
One of the best arguments against white supremacy is spending time with white supremacists.

It's courageous filmmaking when you produce something so timely and critical to the greater good and actually do it from the belly of the beast.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
White Noise is a great and illuminating film, far more engaging and smart than most journalistic profiles of each of these people.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
It's one of the most important - and scariest - documentaries of 2020.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
Unlike other documentaries that study the modern far-right in American life from a distance, Lombroso's film is the only one doing it from the inside looking out.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
I feel queasy about drawing attention to people whose views deserve to be marginalized, scorned, and generally ignored. On the other hand, there's some utility in looking at these folks and knowing what toxins course through their minds.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
The value of this documentary is in seeing these how these hate hucksters operate.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
These people are awful -- but they're also frequently ridiculous, with their childish behaviors and blatant fibs. Mostly they just seem desperate for a public spotlight.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
""White Noise"" culminates by letting its subjects share their delusions of grandeur, but can't sort out if they're pathetic or practical in these uncertain times.
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
It sticks close enough to inner circles that its message sometimes risks coming across as ""extremists are just like us.""
 "
White Noise,87,72,critic,"
There is always a danger when making a film ... about problematic individuals whose views one may not agree with ... that the showcasing of those views leads to their ... propagation.

[Filmmaker Daniel] Lombroso's easy-target subjects, gaudy as they are, make a nominally fascinating study.

It's imperative that, as ugly as it might be to look upon them, movies like White Noise due the duty of exposing the reality, and the genuine, hate-fueled influencers out there.

""Class of 83"" could have been a great crime film, since the story and the cast were there, but unfortunately, nothing else was.

Class of '83,17,44,critic,"
Class of '83 is an agonisingly generic dirty cop thriller that somehow confounded me every step of the way.
 "
Class of '83,17,44,critic,"
Too much of Class of 83 feels like a retread. The faces are new but the portrayal of the system, corruption, the utter lawlessness of both cops and criminals, is familiar.
 "

Bobby Deol is barely credible as an authority figure. Sabharwal stretches Deol to his limits, but they are not enough to make Vijay Singh into a mythical figure capable of restoring the order by breaking the law.

Despite Bobby Deol's unfussy impersonation of a stolid, righteous policeman, the film is more tattle than tension, more acrimony than action.
 "
Class of '83,17,44,critic,"
If there is something Bollywood loves more than living under a rock, it's regurgitating a dull, vapid narrative of honest cops who seek redemption from a corrupt bureaucracy by choosing to bypass the law...

Although Class of 83 had all the ingredients to make a gripping crime drama and recreates a realistic setting, it ends up dishing out a tedious watch...

Class of '83 works both as a well-realised if a trifle sketchy hark-back at an interesting epoch, as well as an entertainer.
 "

Class of '83 demands close attention and that's not hard to give because the director and editor keep it rivetting at all times.
 "

Its characters don't contemplate the morality of their actions; neither do they question the deeds that they have been ordered to carry out. Instead, they revel in the violence, they believe in it.

David Arquette says early in the doc that he been auditioning and being rejected for 10 years.  Check out his IMDB page.  He's actually quite busy.

He'a a very likable guy who is looking for redemption, but there's no way average Americans wouldn't want to talk to Arquette.  There's a scene that goes a little over trying to portray him as a complete loser.  It's overkill.  The second half of the film is heartwarming.   There are wrestling fans who won't watch this because the common theory is 'David Arquette killed the business' (of wrestling).  It's really uplifting even if it's filmed more like an action film.  Arquette served as an executive producer so understand going in this is a vehicle for the protagonist.  Stay through the credits, that's real!  Final Score: 7/10"
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,audience,"Like the Grizzly Man or the Tiger King, delivering next is.. the Magic Man."
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,audience,"You Cannot Kill David Arquette is one of the maddest documentaries I have ever seen.  I know his career from a few films but like most will probably remember him best as the goofy cop from the Scream franchise.  Now I was completely unaware of this but back in 2000 David Arquette was promoting a movie he made called Ready to Rumble.  Part of this promotional tour included a set up match at WCW Wrestling.  Due to the popularity of this appearance, the writers behind WCW wrote Arquette into their wrestling shows and even had him win the WCW Championship belt.  This resulted in two things, firstly Arquette was hated by WCW fans the world over for coming in and stealing this belt from world class athletes and secondly it stalled his acting career as Hollywood no longer saw him as a viable option for casting.  This film chronicles his return to wrestling all these years later, only this time he goes for the proper training to enter as a wrestler rather than an actor in the hope of gaining the respect of the fans.
I thought this was a brilliant documentary, it lifts the curtain behind the theatrics of the sport and also chronicles one man's quest to gain respect from a profession he has loved for so long and now feels he disrespected.  It's funny, it's absolutely brutal in places and surprisingly it is a truly heartfelt quest, you really do feel for the guy on his journey.  There maybe elements of this that were set up, it's difficult to know, whether they were or not, it is still one the most entertaining documentaries I have ever seen."
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,audience,"A riot of a film. Breakdown to redemption, so much humanity and hilarity in between. Wow"
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,audience,"My pro wrestling interest lasted only a few months of my early teens, but I do have a pretty big Arquette soft spot.  Mainly so for his work in some films I really love, like The Grey Zone (my alltime favorite) and Ravenous.  So take my rating here with a grain of salt, but I did find this an engrossing character study."
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,audience,"At first if I came to think why I'm watching this movie I think it was a bad choice, then halfway through the movie it was much more dangerous fun. DAVID ARQUETTE my respects, it was not necessary to go to the extreme."

You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
It's a story of personal redemption that never quite feels fulfilled, but Arquette's directness and eagerness to set things right, if only in his own mind, is compelling.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
Although the film shies away from delving too deeply into the star's physical and mental health issues, You Cannot Kill David Arquette delivers as dirty, feel-good fun; a fist-pumping anthem to the underdog.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
The film never really works as profile or provocation.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
Many of Arquette's difficulties seem manufactured resulting in a climax that's predictable and anti-climactic.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
All that's really needed to understand Arquette's motivations are the words of his brother, Richmond: ""David wants love""... For all its bravado and mystique, what's most striking about You Cannot Kill David Arquette are these simple truths.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
By the end of this documentary, you cannot dislike David Arquette.

Intimate, passionate, and unexpectedly harrowing, You Cannot Kill David Arquette offers a peek behind the curtain to both an enigmatic man and a misunderstood sport.

 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
Real, completely fiction, or some sort of elaborate half-breed hoax like Joaquin Phoenix in I'm Not There, the experience of watching You Cannot Kill David Arquette is an entirely perplexing one.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
If there is a main strength to this documentary, it's that it will appeal to wrestling fans and those seeking some sort of redemption in their lives alike.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
Even for those who haven't a clue why someone like Arquette would choose to get in the ring and put himself in unnecessary danger, this is an incredibly moving and life-affirming lesson in following your dreams at all costs.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
There is something in here for everyone and it's one of those rare documentaries that is not afraid to really show the bad sides of their subject, celebrity or not.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
The film deserves praise for its attachment and warmth to Arquette. As an executive producer of the doc, Arquette isn't afraid to show himself slipping up, falling into old, bad habits. And it lives up to the title. You almost see Arquette actually die.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
You Cannot Kill David Arquette, just like the actor who's the star of this documentary, doesn't take life too seriously and has an attitude that can be funny and pathetic but mostly entertaining to watch.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
I thought it was more bizarre than effective.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
It's an amazing, multilayered look at not just Arquette, but at the world of wrestling.
 "
You Cannot Kill David Arquette,83,91,critic,"
A powerful tale of redemption, self-acceptance, and the supportive people we all need to occasionally lift us up when we're too weak to carry ourselves. Beautiful and weird.

Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,audience,"Over-stretched, repetitive and a drag in parts with TVish feel.

And Vidya Balan should have understood that this is not a 'Dirty Picture' sequel.

It is biography of a mathematician and not of a hooker."
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,audience,audio editing is bad.
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,audience,Kind of a one-trick pony of a movie.  How many times are we supposed to be enthralled by scenes of Shakuntala correctly giving the cube root of very long numbers.   I bailed at the one hour mark.
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,audience,"Those people who are giving this movie low ratings because of 'bollywood masala' probably don't know what Shakuntala Devi was like in real life

The movie completely justified the quirky but genius women Shakuntala Devi was. The movie was about her life and her relationship with her daughter was a huge part of her life so it was important to show it. Many people thought that her relation with daughter was shown like this just to make drama movie but no, her relation with her daughter was not good. This film has every emotions. I would definitely recommend everyone to watch."
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,audience,The worse actor. Did no justice to the character. Don't waste your time on Bollywood.
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,audience,"Absolutely a must-watch. Amazing story. Decent screenplay.  Superb actors. Vidya Balan as usual rocks! But best of all, what an absolutely amazing woman---Shakuntala Devi. The movie beautifully brings out the complexity of this woman's character, her wants and desires, and her struggles."
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,audience,The movie was interesting from beginning to end. I loved the storyline.
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,audience,"This is a must watch movie. "" The world Famous Mathematician , the Human Computer , who plays with the numbers , for whom numbers are best friends , THE GENIUS !! "" ---this is what the world knows , she is also a MOTHER !! Her daughter was like a FUEL from whom the numbers get energy to play . This movie again proves that how precious mother-daughter relationship is !! Vidya Baalan just nailed it !!"
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,audience,‘Shakuntala Devi' is an adequately watchable biopic uplifted by Vidya Balan's electrifying performance.
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,critic,"
Shakuntala Devi's legend is immense.
 "
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,critic,"
Vidya Balan looks the part of Shakuntala Devi, but [the director and writer] come off as observers who never manage to enter her head.
 "
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,critic,"
This intriguing film, with its mix of the real and surreal, takes mothers beyond patriarchal frames of reference and gives them liberty to embrace their frailties and dark sides without a care or concern.
 "
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,critic,"
All-in-all, Shakuntala Devi is very much the epitome of a decent Bollywood biopic. Dramatic moments are inflated and comedic moments are designed to be commercially viable to the masses.
 "
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,critic,"
How long are Vidya Balan Movies going to just rely on being ""Vidya Balan Movies?""
 "
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,critic,"
A warm, whippy dramatization of the life of an extraordinary woman whose head for numbers is the stuff of legend, Shakuntala Devi is consistently entertaining and emotionally engaging...
 "
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,critic,"
Sengupta works well with Balan, and Malhotra and Sadh, as the modern couple, feel right. The film, which stays determinedly cheerful even in the grey hues of London, slides into flatness here and there...
 "
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,critic,"
These are emotionally intelligent threads for a film to cover, but Shakuntala Devi's on-the-nose filmmaking dumbs them down to an extent that the plot loses its sheen.
 "
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,critic,"
A woman living a life unapologetically and portrayed without judgement. That is the film's biggest strength.
 "
Shakuntala Devi: Human Computer,80,52,critic,"
What results is a biopic with genuine character.

The Go-Go's,98,93,audience,Actually better than the band. Served as a great tour of the late 70's early 80's LA punk and Indi scene.
The Go-Go's,98,93,audience,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Go-Go's,98,93,audience,This movie is a great story of not only the origins and formation of one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time but also a great story of friendships and sisterhood and the bonds friends make and how through adversity that bond is always there!!!
The Go-Go's,98,93,audience,"Great doc about the early days until their original breakup of this band. I want to see more. The movie ends at 1984. Fun footage, and excellent interviews."
The Go-Go's,98,93,audience,"The Go-Go's.  I had a great interest in seeing this documentary film because I am, and was a dedicated fan since the 1980's, the beginning of the Go-Go's career.  Full disclosure: I was a huge Go-Go's fan.  So, no surprise that I watched the premiere of the documentary on the day it was released, July 31, 2020.  Since then, I have seen the film 4 times.  I rated this documentary high for the following reasons:
1.  I felt like the director brought in authentic truthful comments from the people portrayed in the film, mainly the artists that worked with the Go-Go's and the Go-Go's themselves.  There was no ""real-life but scripted"" feeling at all.
2.  The documentary's background history of the Go-Go's was something new and fresh that I had never known before as a young fan; and I found it fascinating that I really didn't know a lot about the Go-GO's , who they were, their talents, their story,  and where they came from.
3.  I saw so much in this documentary that would be familiar to a genuine fan but I also saw new photos, news-clippings, and video that I had never seen before.

When the documentary was over, my immediate reaction was I  felt like it was too short and I wanted more. It also made me happy and I knew I would watch it again."
The Go-Go's,98,93,audience,A favorite documentary of the year. I love the Go-Gos and their story but I love this telling of it. There is great humor and care and love in all of it. I look forward to watching it again
The Go-Go's,98,93,audience,"I was never a big fan back in the day but I wasnt a hater either. I liked some of their tunes. What I found appealing about this doc was the humble, yet brutal honesty. Not just about their R&R lifestyle, fame, or breakup which had the usual traps, but their honesty that the sanctity of music wasnt the driving force behind their formation. That it was the punk/ska scene they just wanted to be a part of and music was but a means to an end. One of them says basically ""We sucked. But we didnt care. Nobody did. It was punk. We just plugged in and played and whatever happened, happened."" Not exactly a Prince or Buddy Holly perfectionist, respect the craft mindset. But its who they were and they didnt deny it. It wasnt until they added a few key pieces that the musicianship, work ethic, and quality elevated...which ultimately paid off. I also respect their Pioneer legacy and the guts it took to make some of the uncomfortable decisions & changes they had to make to become what they did. Its not ""If I Leave Here Tomorrow"" but its still a good music doc definitely recommended."
The Go-Go's,98,93,audience,"I was never huge Go Gos fan. Simply enjoyed their ugly pop songs. This documentary has given me a much better appreciation for their music, the women behind that music, their achievements and struggles. I was moved."
The Go-Go's,98,93,audience,"I have it now in my DVR. I've watched it about 10 times already. It's one of the best films/docs I've ever watched. I fell in love all over again. As much as I am not a fan of the RRHOF lately, thank god The Cars finally got in. The Go-Go's must be inducted !!!  They made history and we love them for it !!! Their music is authentic and wild and great ! Let's GO GO GO !!!"
The Go-Go's,98,93,audience,"Color-by-numbers rock doc. Sure, I get the All-Girl band factor, they were trail blazers. The story matters... but in retrospect the Go-Go's catalog was thin. If you are a student of rock n' roll (like me) you'll like this."
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
A refreshing film with some great insight in to instant fame, and the eighties.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
That it's hardly groundbreaking or seriously in-depth is likely the source of its charm -- in just under two hours it provides a surprisingly satisfying ""Behind the Music""-style survey of the career of a fascinating and criminally underrated band.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
Directed by Alison Ellwood, The Go-Go's delivers everything you'd want out of a rock doc.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
Anyone skeptical of serious musicianship coexisting with pop effervescence should seal their lips upon watching The Go-Go's.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
As director Alison Ellwood shows in her briskly entertaining documentary -- The Go-Go's -- the band's members can explain away, with enormous charm, the naked ambition that made them the most successful ""girl group"" ever.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
The doc's goal: Don't think of the Go-Go's as a bit of Reagan-era nostalgia, the musical equivalent of a Rubik's cube. Think of them as a first-tier, kick-ass rock group, period, full stop, the end. Mission accomplished.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
""The Go-Go's"" is an entertaining and well-put together package on a musical group who should command the respect of their male peers.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
Perhaps this film and the buzz surrounding it can finally deliver the accolades and recognition The Go-Go's so richly deserve.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
Even though the Go-Go's story has been told before (and some would say better) on Behind the Music, this documentary is interesting enough, but not essential, for people who want an overall history of the band.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
The band deserves this fine film.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
Anyone with even a passing interest in the Go-Go's... must watch Alison Ellwood's documentary.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
The Go-Go's have not yet been awarded their proper place [in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]... After the world sees Alison Ellwood's splendid documentary, that omission is bound to be put to rights.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
[Director Alison] Ellwood ultimately shows the group as a proper rock band without the female asterisk; you're left seeing more than some all-female blip in musical history.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
Watching the film, it's pure pleasure to witness such scrappy exuberance, such mayhem so enthusiastically pursued.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
Overall, The Go-Go's is an amazing biopic of a band with a great story, chronicling the great stories of the individuals who made it all happen.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
Combining in-depth interviews ... and copious archival footage, Ellwood paints a three-dimensional portrait of the group and their ascension to the summit of fame and success.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
They still Got the Beat.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
This film isn't always ""upbeat,"" but it is honest. It's the story of a still underrated, pioneering rock band - who, like a lot of pioneers, sometimes got a little lost.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
A fine tribute to an immortal band.
 "
The Go-Go's,98,93,critic,"
A testament to sisterhood and how age, wisdom, and an understanding of how rare and special certain relationships are can bust through even the most hardest grudges.
 "
Me and the Cult Leader,100,,critic,"
Me and the Cult Leader may be a bit too long, but it is brutally sincere, interesting, dramatic, shocking, and sheds much light to a case, an organization and two radically opposite men, while providing food for much thought. An excellent documentary.
 "
Me and the Cult Leader,100,,critic,"
Me and the Cult Leader proves to be a study not just in the possibilities of interpersonal understanding over mass tragedies, but also its limits.
 "
Me and the Cult Leader,100,,critic,"
Me and the Cult Leader is an excellent documentary in that special league of films in which characters pursue or reject the opportunity for catharsis.
 "
Me and the Cult Leader,100,,critic,"
A considered and thoughtful documentary which tackles a highly emotional and volatile subject through quiet and measured conversations.
 "
Me and the Cult Leader,100,,critic,"
This is a moving and challenging film that showcases the importance of conversation in recovery from individual and national trauma.
 "
Me and the Cult Leader,100,,critic,"
As its subtitle makes plain, Me and the Cult Leader is a portrait of banal evil...
 "
Me and the Cult Leader,100,,critic,"
A compelling film which tests the boundaries of journalistic ethics, Me And The Cult Leader will keep you constantly wondering who is in control, whilst raising questions about the nature of power.
 "
Me and the Cult Leader,100,,critic,"
Me And The Cult Leader shape-shifts and grows into something rich, thought-provoking and strangely affecting as it unspools.

Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,audience,Gulabo Sitabo is a hugely disappointing film to the point of being a useless venture.
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,audience,The movie with its wonderful cinematography and direction is a satire and gives lessons about greed and care.
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,audience,"Weak script, unnecessary characters, the movie doesn't know what it's trying to do with itself."
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,audience,"movie is a click bait.. with stars like AB and recent success. poor content, music..super booooooooooooore

Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,audience,Authentic setting and characters. Funny and true to life. A black comedy well executed.
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,audience,Excellent cinematography and outstanding acting  . Very sad to see the rating given by dumb audience and disguised it shows how pathetic taste audience have. I really cheers and cherish Mr amitav  Bachhan and Mr Ayushman khurana's excellent performance and the beautiful story line .
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,audience,'Gulabo Sitabo' is decent entertainer that works due to its enduring performances and old-world squabbles.
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,audience,"The movie misses to make any sence.
The entire plot revolves around tention between a landlord and tenant but doesn't come to any conclusion.
Ayushman and Amitabh are great at what they do but 
It neither makes me laugh nor longing for more.
Waste of time."
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,audience,Great satirical drama with fantabulous performance by both leads and mention owner lady rocks..
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,audience,"The legend Amitabh surrounded by versatile Actors like Ayushmann, Vijay Raaz & Brijendra Kala do justice to their respective roles... Director Shoojit Sircar has this uncanny knack of attention to details which he portrays in this light hearted comedy. I would recommend it for Bachchan's class Act - he stole the show."
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
Gulabo Sitabo has its moments, the characters and their eccentricities stay with us but how much undivided attention can it command when the going gets slightly tedious?
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
Gulabo Sitabo just doesn't provide much to enjoy besides the evergreen cinematic highlight that is Amitabh Bachchan.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
Delightfully askew.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
Although Gulabo Sitabo can at times feel weakly paced, its clarity in digging through the most primal human tendencies outweigh the minor quibbles.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
It's a risky move - using an entire film as a smokescreen - but one that, in its final moments, pays poignant dividends.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
Shoojit Sircar's Gulabo Sitabo, starring Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana, leaves you with a smile and an ache. And that's a rare combination.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
Gulabo Sitabo surprises with how it gives heft to even the minutest of characters.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
A very deep, multi-layered film with much to say.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
Some may complain of the slow pace of the film but it's sort of perfect for the subject matter and the milieu.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
The message is short and simple: that it's okay to desire a lot in life but extreme greed often doesn't land you in the right place - whether it's a person's heart, house or mahal.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
I missed the zest, the drollness and sharpness, that Juhi Chaturvedi's writing is so full of.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
Gulabo Sitabo is not zippy in the way Vicky Donor and Piku were, nor over-emphatic with any point it makes. It is a slow burn.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
Star power aside, it's more chamber work than symphony, more character study than Bollywood blowout. Refreshing on all counts.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
Unlike a Piku or even October, the people who inhabit the frame in Gulabo Sitabo live on the fringes of the society; they lie for a few pennies and scrounge and save all their lives. Like the house they inhabit, their lives need a desperate lick of paint.
 "
Gulabo Sitabo,73,54,critic,"
You watch puzzled as - like the ageing pile at the story's centre - the film flakes, moulders and crumbles before you.

Bulbbul,83,71,audience,"Los actores hacen un buen trabajo, pero la trama es un poco aburrida y muy rara."
Bulbbul,83,71,audience,"Great acting, you really don't get a full understanding until you watch the whole movie. I loved it. Just be sure to pause it if you have to step out."
Bulbbul,83,71,audience,"Bulbbul, the movie released in 2020 on Netflix and it is 82% fresh according to rotten tomatoes score. well i certainly don't agree . the movie is supposed to be a supernatural mystery horror but it is not good at any of those 3 words. Movie's score is very mystical and is one of my favourite movie scores. the movie's story is predictible and has nothing new in it. movie's bright color pallate is surely a unique element but movie's screenplay in not ans is very weak. The arcitecture, the characters nothing makes sense here. Paoli Dam did a wonderful work as Binodini and Rahul Bose was refreshing to see in a double role but everything else was boring and rotten"
Bulbbul,83,71,audience,"Masterfully shot, Bulbbul was a wonderful visual experience that takes you through a metaphorical plot set in an age where misogyny was ubiquitous."
Bulbbul,83,71,audience,I was shocked by watching rebirth of a brutally raped girl. She rises like a sun and gorgeous as glittering stars. This movie is a tribute to every girls. Best movie ever
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
An anti-fairytale at its very core, this feminist fable is arguably the most gorgeous looking thing to have come out of Hindi cinema all year.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
This densely layered and visually stunning Bollywood import plays a little like the classic Japanese horror film Audition.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
Bulbbul reflects upon this thought as it condemns the culture of silence that women are subjected to. It reminds you what you are truly capable of, once you decide to avenge injustice and seek redemption.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
The best any critical Western viewer might offer in praise is ""Nice try.""
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
1 of the questions the film throws up&doesn't answer is if the binary between being a devi or chudail is the only recourse feminine power has to navigate in this patriarchal set up. No easy answers in sight but nevertheless a visually appealing film.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
Whilst Bulbbul doesn't fulfil the potential we've seen out of the country's genre film scene, it's still a lush and disturbing hybrid of folk-horror and fairytale.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
Bulbbul isn't the sort of spine-chilling film that will spook you out of your mind but it is engaging enough not to ever let you off the hook.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
Though Dutt erases the misogynistic and patriarchal overtones of [the] chudail [folklore for] a feminist spin, ... she doesn't add to it in any meaningful manner.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
That Bulbbul still manages to make for a hypnotic experience is a quiet triumph, a testament to Dutt's distinct storytelling and efficient casting.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
Thinly written but meticulously shot, producer Anushka Sharma's follow-up to the brilliant Paatal Lok is a bit of a letdown.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
Overall, it's a fantastic debut for Anvita Dutt. Bulbbul feels like it's been directed by an experienced hand and not a newbie.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
Among other joys that it offers then is the fact that Bulbbul is one of those rare contemporary Hindi films to travel beyond the Hindi belt and Punjab to a culture and place that Bollywood does not often visit these days.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
For a narrative inspired by director Anvita Dutt's affection for words, perhaps it's both ironic and fitting that Bulbbul wears the distinct visual aura of a dreamer...
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
Suspenseful, visually arresting, and chock-full of charismatic performances, Bulbbul is an incredibly impressive debut from director Anvita Dutt and a must-see for your next movie night.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
Bulbbul is fashioned as a sharply relevant fable. It is a powerfully feminist, revisionist tale of a woman wronged, and it is told with economy, precision, style and feeling.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
Dimri is a stunner who speaks volumes with her eyes. And the audience can do little but stay enraptured.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"
There appears to be a layer or two missing in the screenplay, but whatever is on the screen for 94 minutes is smart, sensitive and haunting.
 "
Bulbbul,83,71,critic,"

Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,audience,Rotten... watch only if you want to die in pain..

Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,audience,What the heck is wrong with this movie
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,audience,"Definitely, AK's most accessible film."
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,audience,Haphazard and lacking coherent storyline. It tries to be artsy but doesn't appear natural. couldn't finish watching it.
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,audience,'Choked' is a petite but largely engaging thriller that should be relished for its theme and performances.
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,audience,Another anti-Modi leftist propaganda film by Anurag Kashyap. An incoherent storyline and unnecessary underdeveloped characters.
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
The film is marked by a baffling listlessness, a foreign trait in an Anurag Kashyap production. For a thriller, Choked's plot plods. Its dialogues are pedestrian. The characters' desires lack the sting that makes them magnetic
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
[A] riveting tale of secrets and lies.
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
The realism in the dialogue, the incisive casting choices, and the deep engagement with relevant social and political themes make Choked so wholly an Anurag Kashyap movie. Another distinct entry in his wonderfully varied filmography.
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
Choked doesn't have anything to say about the socio-political ramifications of demonetisation. Instead, it's merely used as a plot device.
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
It's a solid story with the surety of Netflix's ample budget behind it, though, and it's also a story that was worth telling and will likely resonate with many.
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
The film begins with a great premise but doesn't quite live up to it. You expect an Anurag Kashyap film to be more gritty, more searing but you feel like he has pulled in his punches...
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
Kashyap's last two breathtakingly good films were Mukkabaaz and Raman Raghav 2.0. Choked wants to say a lot, but is not even as hard-hitting or entertaining as his tweets.
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
Confusing Indian drama has language and violence.
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
Whatever your political affiliation or take on demonetisation, there's a lot of pleasure to be found in this engaging film about lousy lives bolstered by illegal money.
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
'Choked' effectively underscores the old assertion that the personal and the political are often the same thing
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
A perfectly watchable and engrossing peek into a culture, its classes and its politics - governmental and sexual.
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
In Choked, the theme and metaphors feel stamped-on rather than organically infused.
 "
Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai,54,45,critic,"
Retrofitted by director Anurag Kashyap to suit his singular sensibilities, Netflix's Choked is a magic-realist metaphor for clogged dreams, and a striking satire of sycophancy.

This Teacher,100,,audience,Wow. A provocative film in an important historical moment. Pushes viewers to face uncomfortable biases within ourselves. My mind is still reeling.
This Teacher,100,,critic,"
This Teacher is both a step forward in representation and a wildly enthralling viewing experience.
 "
This Teacher,100,,critic,"
A strangely provocative film balanced between social parable and psychological horror, Mark Jackson's This Teacher watches a woman having a breakdown in a world that insists on denying its own madness.
 "
This Teacher,100,,critic,"
It's a film that always seems to know exactly what it's doing, even if Jackson's intent is often baffling to the viewer.
 "
This Teacher,100,,critic,"
This Teacher is an exceptionally written, slyly funny yet emotionally harrowing film that is carried by Hafsia Herzi's incredible performance.
 "
This Teacher,100,,critic,"
The setting is as important a character as Hafsia...never threatening or violent enough to be behind enemy lines, but definitely [different enough] to feel isolating.
 "
This Teacher,100,,critic,"
Herzi commands attention in the central role - her performance offers a similar potency to Helena Howard in Madeline's Madeline - as her character experiences something lurking on the knife-edge between divine revelation and mental breakdown.
 "
This Teacher,100,,critic,"
Lifts the veil to show us the hidden face of many who'd love to believe themselves progressive when they're merely small cogs in a much larger wheel of systemic racism.

Shoot to Marry,76,,audience,"Funny and moving, Shoot To Marry is an indie doc that delivers.

Filmmaker Steve Markle trains his camera on unique and interesting women with hopes of finding enlightenment and maybe even love. Steve shoots with artist Kate, an old crush. In New York, Steve films with Heidi, a brilliant hat-maker. In Toronto where Steve lives, he films with a dominatrix, a rabbi, a massage therapist turned pilot and other fascinating women.

Steve longs for the relationship he sees in his parents. They met on a blind date fifty years ago and have been blissfuly married ever since. Steve's attempts to find love with online dating and a personal matchmaker lead to dead ends. The best way to meet interesting women, Steve decides, is to make a documentary about them.

Shoot To Marry debuted at the 2020 Slamdance Film Festival where it created buzz and won a major award. It's no surprise that Markle won over audiences in Park City. He has a unique voice and with Shoot To Marry he delivers an indie doc that is raw, deeply personal and highly entertaining."
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
Markle finds the humor in heartbreak but he also finds the heart in heartbreak.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
The personal growth that occurs as the project develops more than earns the exploitative nature of the premise.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
The result has connected with viewers. Shoot to Marry was named Breakout Feature Audience Award winner at the Slamdance festival... more recently, the online Canadian Film Festival gave it the Best Feature prize. I'm a little more torn.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
Shoot to Marry is a charming addition to a well-trod genre.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
[Shoot to Marry] is an occasionally rambling, sometimes cringe-y and always heartfelt document of Markle's quest to find the person who might help him heal his broken heart and give him what he has always wanted - someone to marry.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
Shoot To Marry is funny and interesting, but more out of sheer awkwardness.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
The film is often amusing, always interesting and admirable in showing women in a very wide spectrum of careers, but that unsettling issue of Markle's approach, pitching his documentary as one 'about women,' while trying to find a mate, nags.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
It rightly tips its hat to the cast of female participants whose involvement amplifies Markle's (and the film's) true point: that love is elusive and often a monumental pain in the ass, but so very worth pursuing.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
What should be an off-putting premise is nothing of the sort; Markle's sad-sack act is really just an excuse for an observational doc that illuminates how terribly ordinary and a little lonely most people are.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
In a post-#MeToo environment, one has to read the room.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
Indie doc shows the pitfalls of modern romance in fine Woody Allen-esque fashion.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
I get that Markle was trying to add the whole comedy element, but pseudo dating women who had no idea he was trying to actually date them really didn't come across all that funny to me...
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
Watch Shoot to Marry and see this vulnerable fellow discover his better self.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
With this delightful film, a real-life rom-com, Markle proves to be a natural storyteller with a gift for finding comedy in every moment.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
This documentary is extremely intimate. Three quarters of this film were uncomfortable to watch... You are kind grossed out by what's happening but not enough to turn it off because you need to see how it is going to end.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
Shoot to Marry is a heartfelt documentary that is equal parts introspective, quirky, funny, sad and joyful.
 "
Shoot to Marry,76,,critic,"
Markle has a gift for comedy. Shoot to Marry aims for laughs more than enlightenment, a hilarious narrative that never takes itself too seriously.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
Oskouei allows the women to treat his camera as a confessional, positioning his film as a map between them and their own souls.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
A powerful documentary which shines a light on the plight of girls growing up in a traditional society where freedom is only possible through the whims of men.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
No convicted murderers could look less fearsome than the demure subjects of this low-key but startling documentary from Iran's Mehrdad Oskouei.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
With unobtrusive direction and restrained judgment (though the inhumane inequities are clear), Sunless Shadows offers unparalleled, poignant insight into Iranian society.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
What [Oskouei] mostly captures is camaraderie and commiseration, the solace these girls have found in each other's company, even as they reckon with the events that landed them there.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
A startling, raw confrontation with Iran's patriarchy.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
Mehrdad Oskouei's documentary is striking for the way its subjects describe horrific forms of violence in the plainest of language.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
Sunless Shadows is such a brilliant documentary because it treats the subject matter with the gravitas it needs. To accomplish this, Oskouei uses an intimate observational lens and his excellent relationship with the subjects.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
Oskouei's documentary presents an agonizing view of patriarchal power in public and private life, law and custom alike.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
""Sunless Shadows"" never gives off the impression of extracting feelings from its subjects: Rather, it receptively gives them a platform they've hitherto been denied.
 "
Sunless Shadows,100,,critic,"
It's a tough subject, but Oskouei approaches it with care, capturing the girls through quiet observation and then giving them a more overt voice in moments when they are alone and in charge of a camera.
 "
Caught in the Net,,,critic,"
For a film where you want to look away from the screen almost the whole time, Caught in the Net is impossibly gripping.
 "
Andrey Tarkovsky: A Cinema Prayer,,,audience,Very beautiful. What a poet that man was. One of my all-time favorite artists.
Andrey Tarkovsky: A Cinema Prayer,,,audience,"Similar to another documentary 'Kubrick by Kubrick', this documentary allows the man himself Andrey Tarkovsky to speak of his work, which you get some sort of idea of his free spirited mind and his thought progress of his work that would inspire so many.

A poetic tribute that fitted his style perfectly."
Andrey Tarkovsky: A Cinema Prayer,,,critic,"
Of course, this documentary is a must-see for Tarkovsky's devotees but it's a must-see for cinephiles in general.

Butt Boy,70,66,audience,Definitely a WTF did I watch movie. Odd to the point where you don't know if you love it or want to vomit
Butt Boy,70,66,audience,"this is a disturbing film i just realized
being the reason i am writing this review whole heartingly
last night ish i watch butt-boy and monday night football pittsburg vs. cincinatti
audio film butt-boy ; football no sound
this is the setting of my viewing of this distrurbing picture 
futher i watch it out of the recomendation of josh waters
witch choosing the film as the best picture of the year for the 2020 artforum list
i get waters' choice substantailly. its a great pic for the king of trash 
yet the film has a budget yall' 
and further 
its kinda serious
and evokes memrories of todd solodnz films 
in its absurd humour esc. this film is attempting to be cult and wants to be on a list 
with The Room things of that nature
yet 
its kinda unsettling and in a sense does not deserve direct cult status 
with its short tempered preseestation. i think it misses a bit with its direction when it comes to identity and image structre. yet as you ponder a bit about it in general you begin to go where did this picture come from ?
it comes off as a troma film too 
like dirty humour , but it seems like kinda serious about it 
where like lloyd usually is just silly and abstract. this film like wants to be The Room of troma films. and maybe it is . especially with the approval of John Waters"
Butt Boy,70,66,audience,😂🤣😅 😈🌪 What a hidden horror comedy gem ... Have a high ball take a hit off the flower & ENJOy 😉 
Butt Boy,70,66,audience,"It was an amazing movie. It perfectly made a stupid idea serious, something I wish I could aspire to do. If you want a comedy but also something serious watch it. It has a lot of plot and is well thought out and at the end everything comes together perfectly. It's a must watch before you die."
Butt Boy,70,66,audience,This is probably the dumbest movie I've ever watched
Butt Boy,70,66,audience,A great movie. A serial abductor who like to put his victims up his ass. My top movie of 2020 
Butt Boy,70,66,audience,"Dumb as hell. I thought it'd at least be quirky-funny, but about the most this mess can muster is a couple of bad puns. If you wondered what kind of movie an alcoholic pothead would make, look no further."
Butt Boy,70,66,audience,"Why bad rating?
This is the good vs the evil butt. It will never get better.

That cop is a good actor, i hope he gets famous.

Movie really enjoyable and gives you that 80s cop movies vibe, with a twist of horror,  in a very butt full way haha!"
Butt Boy,70,66,audience,"ANAL RETENTION - My Review of BUTT BOY (3 1/2 Stars)

Chip Gutchell feels dead inside.  An office IT drone who goes through the motions with his wife, he seems sapped of joy until one day at a scheduled prostate exam, he discovers he likes things stuck up his butt.  He starts out innocently enough, inserting small objects, but when larger, breathing things go missing in the community, in steps hard-living Detective Fox, who also happens to be sponsored by Chip at their local AA chapter.  Sounds like the makings of a great John Waters movie, eh?  You'd be wrong.  Butt Boy, the debut feature of Tyler Cornack, who stars as Chip, directs from a script he co-wrote with Ryan Koch, plays things, to its credit, with immense seriousness.  What could have easily been a silly, gross-out comedy, instead presents itself as a hard look at toxic masculinity and addiction.

The film would make for a great double feature with this year's Swallow, which takes an equally sobering look at a woman who ingests foreign objects. Taken together, these films shine a light on the stark differences between how men and women see themselves in the world.  Whereas Swallow's Hunter eats thumbtacks and screws as a way to exert control over her suffocating marriage, Butt Boy's Chip does it for the sheer pleasure of it all and because he really doesn't care about anybody but himself.  

The film gets credit for maintaining a consistent tone throughout, even when things go off the rails in the third act.  Cinematographer William Morean frames things beautifully in the first act, always aware of Chip's complete remove from the outside world.  When Detective Fox (a fantastic Tyler Rice) enters the film with his backstory of pain and loss, the look changes to that of a 80's exploitation cop film, filled with smoke, headlight glares and saturated colors.  Add to that the insane final sequence and you have an incredibly satisfying cinematic experience.  For such a low budget film, you'll really believe the visceral jolt if its climactic setting.  It's grotesque yet powerful.  

Cornack and Koch also wrote the pulsating synth-head score, which really layers on that 80s vibe.  Except for a bad pun or two, the characters never wink at the audience to let us know they're in on the joke.  In fact, Butt Boy is no joke at all.  It's about a large segment of our population who enjoy chewing people up and spitting them out while completely discounting their humanity.  

The Chip Gutchell's of the world are monsters dressed in khakis and chambray shirts.  Cornack plays Chip with one deadpan note, yet it doesn't get old because he knows that a guy who can get away with anything he wants wouldn't really have to spend much energy on things like empathy or kindness.  He's a living id with a huge ego yet completely devoid of a super-ego.  Sound like any elected officials you know?"
Butt Boy,70,66,audience,You've got to go into this movie accepting the premise and it'll take you on a wild ride that won't let you down
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
In leaning heavily into the idea of playing the premise straight, Butt Boy finds itself as even more of a one-joke movie than it already was.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
I think I like ""Butt Boy,"" though I'm not entirely sure. It's definitely a curious sight to behold.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
Butt Boy strikes a rare and masterful balance of humor and tension, making it a unique and effective film-going experience.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
It touches on addiction, compulsion, career emptiness and, at its heart, loneliness...
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
Butt Boy is not bizarre enough to embrace the weird and truly become the genuinely oddball film that I can recommend wholeheartedly.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
No one should be that desperate, so if your evening comes down to choosing between another film and this one, you should probably avoid this number two option.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
Writer-director Tyler Cornack and co-writer Ryan Koch have created a tale of fetishes and obsession, but draped it within a gumshoe driven mystery which is keenly aware of its campy roots.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
The colonic tonic we've been waiting for.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
You may not be able to believe what the one-of-a-kind detective-thriller/horror-satire Butt Boy is actually about - but [it might be] one of the best films of 2020. Seriously.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
If you're like me, and you adore absurd cinema, then BUTT BOY is a must watch.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
Instead of a gross-out gag fest, Butt Boy is a surprisingly tender bizarro comedy that works because it plays the strangeness straight.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
It may seem like a completely absurd, ""bad on purpose"" exploitation flick, but Butt Boy has some genuine pathos at its core.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
I've never been happier for a filmmaker to just finally be so firmly up his own ass. Butt Boy can't really live up to the wildness of its premise, but it makes for entertaining viewing in its own right.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
Believe it or not, Butt Boy isn't just a silly, ridiculous thriller about a man and his love of shoving things into his rear, it is, for lack of a better term, much deeper than that.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
Butt Boy isn't the worst film of 2020 - but it won't be far from the bottom.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
If your sense of humor favors stupid ideas done smartly... ""Butt Boy"" offers pleasures that aren't even all that guilt-inducing.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
The execution of Butt Boy is a little like holding court with a one-of-a-kind dirty joke but pausing constantly to insist it's not a joke.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
With that much ambition on display, the movie leaves an impression reminiscent of the high-minded ""Key & Peele"" sketches that paved the way for Jordan Peele to become a master filmmaker.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
Watching Butt Boy, all I could think was that both John Waters and Brian De Palma would be proud.
 "
Butt Boy,70,66,critic,"
If you're going to watch one movie this year about the chaos caused by a neverending bum chute, make it this one.

Once Upon a Time in Uganda,100,,critic,"

Once Upon a Time in Uganda instantly joins the pantheon of great films about the heroics of low-budget filmmakers.

Once Upon a Time in Uganda is a nice supplement to the ongoing, exciting story of Wakaliwood and the perfect thing to tie us over whilst we wait for their next awesome movie.

Once Upon a Time in Uganda,100,,critic,"
Once upon a time in Uganda, there was a director worth celebrating.

Once Upon a Time in Uganda,100,,critic,"
Once Upon a Time in Uganda shows how our love of film is able to transcend culture.

Once Upon A Time In Uganda is a triumph on all levels. It is filmed with style, follows immensely likable people, and has an infectious, exuberant spirit that is impossible to resist.
 "
Maxima,90,,critic,"
Here is a story which should inspire for many reasons. Should give us hope. Show that one person can make a difference.
 "
Maxima,90,,critic,"
Diane Sparrow's MAXIMA (2019) could end there, another blotch on Mother Earth, but, the documentary soon focuses on one remarkable woman, Máxima Acuña, and her family's determination to keep their way-of-life.
 "
Maxima,90,,critic,"
In the film, we come to intimately understand Máxima and her family's struggles. Sparrow and team not only introduce us to this warrior woman, but also ask us to think about society's demand for precious metals affects others directly.
 "
Maxima,90,,critic,"
Overall, Maxima is a really educational and informational look into the truth behind big mining as experienced through one strong-willed indigenous woman.
 "
Maxima,90,,critic,"
Sparrow ... has chosen her subject wisely, in cinematic terms.
 "
Maxima,90,,critic,"
Maxima serves its subject well and tells her story with facts and footage to back up her statements.
 "
Maxima,90,,critic,"
Maxima is a powerful story of resiliency, a finely crafted documentary that thoroughly explains the stakes at hand from both a political and a human perspective.
 "
Maxima,90,,critic,"
Maxima might be said to not so much elevate [Maxima Acuña] to a martyr as reduce her to one. Wanting for its subject's passion, it's filmmaking as dry as those desiccated mines.
 "
Maxima,90,,critic,"
Director Sparrow stays unflinchingly focused on the struggle between the two sides, ratcheting up suspense over a tight run time.
 "
Maxima,90,,critic,"
Sparrow never takes her eyes off Máxima's tremendous story. It's the right choice.
 "
I Am Not Alone,100,,critic,"
This unbelievably inspiring film is for anyone who doesn't believe in the power of protests.
 "
I Am Not Alone,100,,critic,"
The magnificent I Am Not Alone is a call to action to all of us, for none of us are alone when we stick together. It's a comforting thought in these perilous times.
 "
I Am Not Alone,100,,critic,"
I Am Not Alone is an inspiring portrait of democratic self-determination.
 "
I Am Not Alone,100,,critic,"
I Am Not Alone takes pains to make sure we not only know what exactly is happening at any given moment but also why.
 "
I Am Not Alone,100,,critic,"
We get first-hand accounts from the ground as well as recorded interviews in the aftermath of all the major players-[protagonists and antagonists alike].
 "
I Am Not Alone,100,,critic,"
While unabashedly pro-Pashinyan, the film reveals a bit more than it probably intends to about what it takes to bring about mass political change in the age of social media, neoliberal branding, and shifting global ideologies.
 "
Thappad,93,71,audience,"Various and valid questions raised by the film maker impacting lives of women from diverse background, social status, age and so on. it talks about importance of one's self awareness and the dismissal one faces by the society suffering from deep rooted social conditioning. everyone performed really well. although Tapsee's dialogue delivery and acting method was similar to other movies I have seen of her. I saw more of Tapsee in Amrita then seeing Amrita as a person of her own. This fine work is not for masses but for progressive thinkers of the society."
Thappad,93,71,audience,Cinematic brilliance. Another masterpiece from Anubhav Sinha.
Thappad,93,71,audience,This was a bad film on all counts.. except perhaps the occasionally better performance of Tapsee.. nothing special or remarkable about this film.
Thappad,93,71,audience,"Thappad's premise had promise but was overly melodramatic and preachy at times. It went from artfully depicting morals to explicitly verbalizing them out unnecessarily, like a lecture. Movie could have been better and saved an hour if those portions were cut out."
Thappad,93,71,audience,A lot of times women forget their happiness matters too. Really proud of this movie. 
Thappad,93,71,audience,"Excellent movie - good performances, important story line but still manages to keep it light and entertaining too."
Thappad,93,71,audience,"For people who watch Bollywood movies somewhat actively, ""Thappad"" is a nice change of pace. This movie takes on important issues and is more somber and quiet than most Indian movies. I think the movie had solid performances and felt fairly grounded in reality. It's a movie that addresses important topics and is meant to be thought-provoking. That being said, the movie doesn't always move and at times it is kind of at a standstill. While I think there are similar social dramas that have more entertainment value, I still think this is a good movie that is worth checking out primarily because of the bold statements it makes."
Thappad,93,71,audience,Utter waste of your time. Movie is too lagging and tends to give wrong message. Wasted 2 hours of my life.
Thappad,93,71,audience,"The movie has meaningful dialogues with a realistic story-line. Overall a good movie with many takeaways for Indian moms, sons, and family members."
Thappad,93,71,audience,"This is one the best movies I've ever seen.
The best story line for women's rights after and before marriage. 
And acting by Ms. Taapsee Pannu is out of this world.Period!!"
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
The ensemble cast is outstanding.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
In Thappad, starring Taapsee Pannu, writer-director Anubhav Sinha and co-writer Mrunmayee Laagoo have succeeded in creating an entire, matter of fact, lived in universe, joh relatable bhi hai, aur isliye effective bhi.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
The story of one woman becomes that of every woman, every man and the everyday male entitlement.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
There are several moments from Thappad that I am still thinking through.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
Thappad is one of the finest Hindi domestic dramas in recent years.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
These are incongruities in a film that otherwise marks an important moment in the history of Hindi cinema.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
Taapsee Pannu and Anubhav Sinha's film will stay with you and make you question the status quo. One of the most powerful films to come out this year.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
Hat's off to director Anubhav Sinha for making yet another well-meaning and powerful film asking all the right questions. It's 2020 and it's a shame that it has taken this long to say that even one slap shouldn't be tolerated.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
Thappad resonates, as it is meant to.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
Thappad is not just a film aimlessly ranting about borderline domestic violence; it brings to light the years of conditioning that a woman is subjected to by her own family and society that she lives in.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
A sincere examination of marriage and domestic violence...
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
The film understands Amrita, and Taapsee Pannu, too. It understands the modesty of her desires and personality of her actions. Thappad, after all, opens with the ultimate image of desi domesticity...
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
Irrespective of your gender or your economic status, you will see something of yourself in Thappad.
 "
Thappad,93,71,critic,"
Thappad's exaggerated screenplay isn't equipped to distill any new insight on the Indian mentality toward displays of male force, taking refuge instead in existing tropes.

I also liked the two leads in the movie and found their relationship to be easy to root for. I did feel the movie lost some energy in the second half but I still think its a good time all around. I hope this movie inspires more stories to be told in Indian cinema and think it is ultimately a step in the right direction."
Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,92,73,audience,"Its a bold direction that Bollywood has gone in, but ultimately its quite a bakwas film. Ayushmann's acting has gotten quite familiar and stale (perhaps too many movies in a short amount of time), and the rest of the cast really shined though to pick up his slack."
Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,92,73,audience,"It is my fault that I had my hopes high after the first movie but this was so disappointing. After Article 15, this is Ayushmaan's another dud."
Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,92,73,audience,The title translated as BE EXTRA CAREFUL OF MARRIAGE is a spin-off or sorts to SHUBH MANGAL SAAVDHAN (BEWARE OF MARRIAGE) about erectile dysfunction continues its theme of of emasculation in conservative Bollywood cinema with a darling laugh riot censuring homophobia while not vulgarising homosexuals and their ceremonious parents.
Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,92,73,audience,"'SMZS' is a delightfully written gay romantic comedy which has its heart and the hearty characters, along with the catchy small town flavour- just in the right place. How I wished the film had the consistent humour which made 'Shubh Mangal Savadhan', it's predecessor, a greater success and a bigger achievement! 
Watch it still, because Ayushmann Khurana and Jeetu Kumar, the leading lover boys, are in fine form and have solid chemistry that's punchy."
Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,92,73,critic,"
The film may be erratic in parts, but its entertainment quotient is delightfully high for a film tackling a clash between conservatism and freedom, between tradition and modernity.
 "
Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,92,73,critic,"
Ayushmann Khurrana stars in an important film that talks about an important subject conveyed in the simplest manner without sounding preachy at any given point.

Shubh Mangal Zyaada Saavdan successfully takes the Michael Moore approach to filmmaking - to make a good message movie, you first have to make a good movie.

Though not perfect, Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan gives viewers one more queer Bollywood narrative to choose from.
 "
Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,92,73,critic,"
Writer-director Hitesh Kewalya is not shying away from the same sex conversation. He's not subtle about it either, but treats the relationship between the lead duo with respect and sensitivity.

Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,92,73,critic,"
SMZS will give small-town parents the much needed nudge, and maybe, in the distant future, they will have the strength to accept their offsprings for who they are...for now, watch it for the performances and the 'chaska' of love.
 "
Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,92,73,critic,"
Watch the film for its hilarious comedy, slick all around performances and ultimately for it's powerful message of love and acceptance.
 "
Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan,92,73,critic,"
SMZS's intelligence extends to its acting. Khurrana and Kumar are not bound by any of the traits formulaic Bollywood has so far compulsorily assigned to gay men.

Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan wants to be both - an impassioned defense of same-sex love as well as a family entertainer. But the writing can't seamlessly blend the disparate elements...

An entertaining, dignified and semi-balanced - if slightly overzealous - rom-com of commercial significance...

Shubh Mangal Zyada Savdhaan compellingly charts the distance that love has traversed in the last two decades. All it asks is that Indian families keep up.

Love Aaj Kal,20,32,audience,"The movie is amazing, actors Aaryan, Sara, Randeep and Sharma at their best, music refreshing and overall an experience. 
I seriously dont know where the movie critics such as Shubra Gupta come from. What right you have to write a bakwaas review? I must say that this is one of the best movies made recently. I think the critics are too critical and there is no substance in their reviews. Can you make a small movie and get people to watch it? Its easy to write bada bada yata yata.....I love the movie, please watch folks. Do not read the idiotic reviews. Look at it as piece of art. Well done movie makers! Especially Aaryan's moves in the last song ...haan main galath.......You and Sara chill bro! Kudos!"
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,audience,"This movie was beyond horrible. The story line made no sense at all. Me and the group I went with was confused and we were an hour in the movie😂. And the acting, wasn't obvious that they were acting. All the acters were trying too hard. Waste of money to be honest. With tickets costing 13$ per person, mind as well stick to youtube with how bad Bollywood movies are becoming ."
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,audience,Pathetic.. nothing much to explain it's just a rotten story!
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,audience,"The first Love Aaj Kal wasn't a perfect film, but it had its powerful moments. It's always been in the ""under-appreciated"" column for me. Love Aaj Kal 2 borrows the framework, but doesn't have any of the charm or poignancy. A large part of it is the lead actors. Where Imtiaz has always written archetypes, talented actors have helped him bring real humanity to the characters. Kartik Aryan and Sarah Ali Khan don't have the chops and stay firmly in the caricature zone. Kartik looks different for once, so kudos for that. His last four movies looked like he was the same character in all of them. He's out of his depth though, with the same pained expression regardless of the scenario. Sarah is just so hyper the whole time, it grates. Randeep Hooda is always amazing and does his part well enough. His breakdown at the end took me back to the best parts of Highway. But that's another thing, even the best moments of this film are poor reconstructions of Imtiaz's earlier works - the misty hill stations of Jab We Met and Highway, the well-lit office corridors of Tamasha. That said, there were a few scenes, like the one where Raj meets Leena on the train, that prove Imtiaz is magic sometimes. I just hope he can get out of his own head for the next one and do something different."
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,audience,worst movie of recent times.
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,audience,"This is among one of the worst movies i have ever watched.
No story line, no acting, total mess."
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,audience,"An underwhelming film from a director that gave us Tamasha , Rockstar etc.
Amit Roy's work is refreshing.The film had its good moments but could not capitalize on it.
But the Bad editing , no character arc for the main cast except Randeep hooda , below par screenplay made it hard for the audience to completely engage into the Film. The back stories for Veer and Zoe could have been given some importance which maybe would made the film slightly better."
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,audience,"The most overrated movie for the year.  Looks like Imtiaz Ali only gets the best of good actors for all his succesful movies. Movie was absolute rubbish, with pathetic performances of lead actors. Not sure why randeep,s character was even there. The lack of directing and zero acting skills was the entire movie, with no co relation of plots of no relevance. First fifteen minutes itself you will realise and same continues for the entire movie."
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,audience,"Terrible, boring movie. Drama for no reason."
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,audience,"Unbelievably bad. Acting, plot, themes, character development—all just pitiful. "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
This Love Aaj Kal is what is known as a""spiritual successor"" or ""spiritual sequel"", except that it is so godawfully boring, contrived and wannabe that it provoked some very unspiritual, unholy feelings in me.
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
The performances, if not wholly consistent, are never short of intriguing.

As for the narrative, the GPS never worked. It's off the mark and if you are an Imtiaz Ali fan, be prepared to be disappointed but be ready to be left confused first
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
Love Aaj Kal is crammed with non-sequitur conversations and faux philosophical musings...
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
Imtiaz Ali Imtiaz invites you into the world of imperfect people, complex situations and dysfunctional relationships, but fails to weave it all together despite good performances by Sara Ali Khan and Kartik Aaryan.
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
...such liveliness, and zest: if only the whole film had the same feel. I came away with a feeling of being comprehensively let down: where has the craft gone, and where, indeed, the heart?
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
Of the three actors, it's Randeep Hooda who comes across carrying the most gravitas.
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
Love Aaj Kal sets off to celebrate complex characters and relationships, with the universal emotion of love at its core. It creates some emotional moments, but doesn't quite leave you spellbound.
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
The torturous 141 minutes of Imtiaz Ali's Love Aaj Kal, starring a grating Sara Ali Khan and a scared Kartik Aaryan, plays out like a multiple choice question paper: Love or sex? Career or relationship? Stalking or women's safety?
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
Imtiaz Ali remakes his own Love Aaj Kal to disastrous effect...
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
I go into every Imtiaz movie ready to be seduced by this argument and hoping that he will transport us to that sweet spot - dil aur duniya ke beech. Sadly, Love Aaj Kal misses the mark by a mile.
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
Imtiaz Ali's confessional cinema looks nowhere as honest as his global counterparts'. It feels more like a mockery of the heart than a punch to the gut...
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
Yes, this film is the cinematic equivalent of a Facebook status update from 2008...
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
Whilst this limp remake/reboot/whatever suffers from a terrible script and bad performances that undercut the credibility of Aaryan and Khan as rising stars, it's made worse by a tedious length, zero moments of levity, and no exciting dance numbers.
 "
Love Aaj Kal,20,32,critic,"
Director Imtiaz Ali isn't second time lucky with a reboot of his own 2009 romance film.

Made in Bangladesh,100,80,audience,Shimu is a hero. Beautifully filmed!
Made in Bangladesh,100,80,critic,"
Rubaiyat Hossain's Made in Bangladesh is interesting for one reason and one reason only: it provides a glimpse of the lives of textile workers in Dhaka, Bangladesh and of the city itself.
 "
Made in Bangladesh,100,80,critic,"
The portrait [Hossain] paints, while visually arresting thanks to cinematographer Sabine Lancelin's eye for Dhaka's colorfully saturated and gritty milieu, is a grim one.

Earnest social activist film should remind you of Norma Rae.
 "
Made in Bangladesh,100,80,critic,"
Rubaiyat Hossain's third feature film is striking in both theme and technique. Made in Bangladesh is a formal marvel.
 "
Made in Bangladesh,100,80,critic,"
Made in Bangladesh never sugar coats the near-insurmountable obstacles Shimu and her fellow workers face...[the] mix scenes of Shimu coming up against barriers with scenes of her achieving small successes ensures the film never feels hopeless.
 "
Made in Bangladesh,100,80,critic,"
With Made in Bangladesh, Hossain has crafted an urgent cry for workers' rights, and a vision of feminist solidarity in the face of overwhelming opposition.

As a look behind that T-shirt you just bought on sale for $9.99 at The Gap, and the human labor, sweat and suffering that went into it, this... definitely deserves wider attention.

Colonialism is a war that began hundreds of years ago and never ended. Its modern tactics and its weapons are noted with precision in the ferocious documentary, ""In My Blood It Runs.""

In My Blood It Runs sensitively gives a voice to the Indigenous Australian communities whilst engaging with the socioeconomic issues that affect their livelihoods. It's remarkable.

In My Blood It Runs is Newell's best film yet. It feels like a turning point: the director's aesthetic choices reflecting the contents of her subject's character in different and exciting ways.

Expressed in these straightforward terms, the message is hard to brush off... However you feel about these tactics this is an effective film and, in its commitment to its subjects, an honorable one.

Love Child,100,,critic,"
Director Eva Mulvad follows the family everywhere and over the course of years. Her camera captures all from video chats with friends at home to Mani having a meltdown.
 "
Love Child,100,,critic,"
Its great achievement is to present the faceless and grotesque within a domestic context, never allowing the simple pleasures of life to escape the shadow of statelessness and fear.
 "

The family's new life in Turkey is quite comfortable in some ways, but every new bureaucratic tussle over their immigration status causes anxiety - and the more we get to know the three of them, the more we care about their fate.

Nothing is so universal as mess - and whatever version of it might apply to us, many viewers will surely see a glimmer of themselves in this one microcosm family unit, with limbo stretching ahead.
 "
Love Child,100,,critic,"
Something that so many take for granted is desperately fought for in this intimate documentary following an Iranian family who simply want to stay together and settle somewhere safe.
 "
Love Child,100,,critic,"
I'm not sure I've seen another film that has so movingly put the audience in the shoes of a refugee: the emptiness of leaving everything behind, belonging to nowhere, having nothing.
 "
Love Child,100,,critic,"
Mulvad's strength here is a verité fly-on-the-wall technique, watching the couple through frustration, quarrels, and moments of lightness and joy, in a looping narrative that could be called Scenes from a Refugee Marriage.
 "
Love Child,100,,critic,"
A documentary with all the tensions of a narrative drama, a compelling story of a couple's escape from Iran with their love child.
 "
Love Child,100,,critic,"
Gracefully and artistically constructed, Mulvad's film is an intimate, complicated portrait of a family harassed by the Iranian, Turkish and UN authorities, as well as by inhuman European and American immigration policies.
 "

Love Child is an inherently touching story that adds a poignant dimension to the refugee story with the theme of survivor's guilt. Every story is unique and every one of them is vital.

Thanks to Eva Mulvad and her dedicated fellow filmmakers, Love Child is a testament, in all its observational glory, to the triumph of the best of our common humanity.

Panga,94,83,audience,Kangana's best since Queen.
Panga,94,83,audience,If you love sports movie then this movie can't be missed brilliant story and performance by kangana and entire cast
Panga,94,83,audience,"'Panga' is Ashwini Iyer Tiwari's best work: the director doens't show the least bit of indulgence or any worship for entertainment in this high-octane, delightfully feminist and humorous small town film about the joys of sisterhood and absolute sacrifices a mother makes for the sake of her child. The power of the film also lies in its treatment: it has the much-required lightness of touch, and the performances, especially by Kangana Ranaut, Yagya Bhasin and Richa Chaddha, are impactful as they are impressive. 
Keeping aside it's pretty sloppiness if observed as a sports drama and it's inability to match a more competent 'Dangal', 'Panga' remains one of the best films of this year."
Panga,94,83,audience,"Superb acting by everyone, specially Kangana is a brilliant actress,  loved the movie."
Panga,94,83,audience,"We left after 15 minutes, nothing to like, very flat and shallow"
Panga,94,83,audience,Nice movie.. With heart touching story..
Panga,94,83,audience,Loved it! Very well done character by kangana - really enjoyed the movie!
Panga,94,83,audience,"Recently, there's been plenty of movies about women finding themselves again after dedicating their lives to being a homemaker. However, Panga takes this to the next level by telling the story of a sportswoman who finds her way back to her sport. Not only does she have to push her limits of her mind, but also her body. 

But this isn't just the story of the sportswoman. This is also the story of her family. The entire movie takes into consideration the duties an Indian woman has. To her family. To her child. To her husband. To her parents. 

A story like Panga wouldn't be possible without the immense support of the family."
Panga,94,83,critic,"
Intelligently scripted, deftly directed and well-acted.
 "
Panga,94,83,critic,"
Panga isn't limited to a tussle in a kabaddi match.It's about not letting life get the better of you . Even at the end it isn't a carefully curated victory lap that the film offers .It ends with a million possibilities &that's the beauty of Panga.

Panga is an inspiring love letter to mothers everywhere, telling them that their dreams are valid.
 "
Panga,94,83,critic,"
It is only in the second half that it gradually becomes evident that, heartwarming though the film's positivity is, it also ends up giving us a sanitised view of middle-class India and women's struggles.

Kangana Ranaut's latest is all heart and charm, with an emotional wallop at the end...
 "
Panga,94,83,critic,"
Panga can best be described as a collection of small moments - many resonate, some fall flat. And even though Panga doesn't hit all the right notes, it does a successful job of merging Bollywood's two dearly loved themes...
 "
Panga,94,83,critic,"
Ranaut's Jaya... elevates the movie, putting the story across better than the script can. Ranaut makes Jaya credible and specific; she's not an every woman or every mom or every athlete.
 "
Panga,94,83,critic,"
Panga's strength lies in its capable cast, which brings heart to a largely contrived script that tells more than it shows.
 "
Panga,94,83,critic,"
Panga is a film made by a woman, with women at its centre, making out a case for women needing to push for comebacks. It makes the right kind of noise about women empowerment without being preachy.
 "
Panga,94,83,critic,"
It not only forms an important voice at a time when so many women drop out of the workforce, it is also an extremely well-crafted film.
 "
Panga,94,83,critic,"
That Jaya Nigam, played with absolute conviction by Kangana Ranuat, dares to dream of a past life where she was in the spotlight, is a straight-off win, subject-wise.

Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari and writers Nikhil Mehrotra & Nitesh Tiwari have taken a sweet, tender and extremely digestible route towards telling the story of this woman, who represents many many young mothers in India...
 "
Panga,94,83,critic,"
Kangana Ranaut excels as a kabaddi player on a comeback trail in this slice-of-life drama that puts focus on a mother's aspirations.
 "
Panga,94,83,critic,"
Kangana Ranaut imbues her character with tenderness and sweetness. Though it's hard to steal the show from Ranaut, Jassie Gill stages his own little personal coup in Panga.

Panga works better as an ode to the self-sufficiency of the sisterhood.

Chhapaak,88,85,audience,"This movie is simply amazing, I feel as if this hits so many elements of the Indian Culture. And it addresses a serious issue plaguing the nation. I cannot recommend this enough. It is a must see."
Chhapaak,88,85,audience,"Chapaak is a great movie with a solid performance of all the actors, especially Deepika Padukone who is the main star of film."
Chhapaak,88,85,audience,"""Chhapaak"" is a solid that aims to raise awareness on an important issue. I thought the movie had an impressive first half but ended up being followed by an oddly paced second one. The movie loses its way in the second half, but it does wrap up nicely and reminds us why it is an important movie. I felt it was a good movie, that had the potential to be something great. Nonetheless, I thought Deepika Padukone did a convincing job in the lead role and led the movie effectively. Overall, it's a good movie that can be difficult to watch, but also does raise questions worth talking about."
Chhapaak,88,85,audience,"Chhapak is a wonderful movie with a strong message for the society. Deepika performed really extraordinary as usual which should be dedicated to the innocent acid victims. She played the character very well, Beautifully upholds the life of an acid attack survivor. Deepika, Meghana and Vikrant have done a great job and the lead lady will make you cry uncontrollably when she personated the victim's sufferings. This movie defines the actually struggle of an survivor, injustice,and how the judgemental society reacts towards the victim. It's really very sad that still now acid is available in shops that disclosed very closely in the movie. Vikrant plays a serious NGO activist and at the same time his secret love towards Malti gives us a a emotional attachment. The director, the producer Also the people who have played the Aunty, lawyer and Maltis parents  the entire team of Chhapak has done a beautiful work. You can really feel the pain and joy in their eyes when the verdicts are announced. Deepika deserves all the accolades and awards for the sincere portrayal of Laxmi (the real acid attack survivor). Lots of love to the Real Laxmi Agarwal.  Even some of the real acid attack survivors have played in the movie and have done a great job. The songs of the movie are just outstanding. Every song has a meaning and is connected with the scenes. Overall it's a great film with a strong social message. I just love the team of Chhapak."
Chhapaak,88,85,audience,Made on social cause to give a good message but drags in places with slow pace
Chhapaak,88,85,audience,"Chhapaak is a story of a nineteen year old girl who is a survivor of terrific acid attack and how she takes stand against it.

Meghna Gulzer's Chhapaak is definitely a sensitive story of a woman, Laxmi Agarwal. Deepika Padukone's acting in the role of Laxmi alias Malti is absolutely amazing. But the way Meghna Gulzer executed the character of Malti was looking very dozy, as Deepika Padukone was the soul of the entire concept. 

Moreover Malti who was a simple school going girl of a small city and how her life has changed after the accident is the ultimate benchmark of the movie.

Being an acid survivor people generally gets depressed but in case of Malti she fought against the crime and also took the responsibility of her family after her father's death. She joins a NGO and starts working over there. Her main support was Amol with whom she was working in the NGO.

But in the movie we have seen the fighting spirit of a acid survivor but it was absolutely blank that how an acid survivor feels when she faces the reality. However the edit seems very shaky in certain position.

Chhapaak is not only a movie it is a strong social message to the society as well."
Chhapaak,88,85,audience,About time someone tackled this subject. The movie palls a bit but it is a good effort to raise awareness about this issue. This was based on a school girl's story. The sad part is that acid attacks have increased in India.
Chhapaak,88,85,audience,The acting is mind-blowing. Strong supporting actors. Thought provoking and a feel good movie
Chhapaak,88,85,audience,Great movie with detailed and emotional genre of making. It's perhaps the best film of Deepika Padukone. Actor's work was good.
Chhapaak,88,85,audience,Most irritating movie
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
Like everything else in Chhapaak, the romance between Amol and Malti... takes its time to evolve. But when it does, the director is at her very best.
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
However, despite these effective performances it seems like the film has nothing to say post interval. Although Deepika ""looks"" her part as the acid attack survivor, the events seem more like a reconstruction rather than a comprehensively built story.
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
If the conversation around acid regulation was dying down, Gulzar's film beautifully reinvigorates it and not simply due to the Deepika Padukone stimulus package.
 "

Meghna Gulzar has once again shown it's possible to marry art with mart.
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"

The reason I'm even in a position to ponder over the intent of Chhapaak is producer-actor Deepika Padukone's lead turn as Malti
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
Brave and commendable. This makes the movie hard to watch but also hard to turn away from...
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
...what we are left with are good intentions, a heart in the right place, a major star taking a huge risk with an unorthodox role and a bunch of pluses that somehow do not come together to deliver an immersive experience.
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
Deepika Padukone's performance and Meghna Gulzar's direction ensure that Chhapaak is like a splash that leaves you misty with emotions, if not entirely drenched...
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
Chhapaak is not a film that lets you go easy, just as one begins to settle in to think Malti has managed to get better of her perpetrator, it jolts you with a few grim, uncomfortable reminders.
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
Meghna Gulzar's film is all heart as it takes on the scourge of acid attacks. Deepika Padukone shows the mastery on her craft as she emerges as Malti.
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
Yes, it's worthy, but it's also very watchable.
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
Chhapaak is life-affirming and sobering, so don't duck this disturbing and compelling drama.
 "
Chhapaak,88,85,critic,"
Chhapaak earns its flourishes through Gulzar's compassionate gaze, that guarantees that the film doesn't pity Malti or work overtime in demanding sympathy for her.

Ghost Stories,33,16,audience,Boy this was a weird collection! Lust stories was far better in comparison. Even Ram Gopal Varma could have made a better horror collection.
Ghost Stories,33,16,audience,pretty forgettable; i wouldn't recommend.
Ghost Stories,33,16,audience,I really liked the last 2 . Its honestly not that bad if you want to be amused and like creepy small stories. By no way did i think i wasted my time.
Ghost Stories,33,16,audience,"The idea where you mix 4 short horror stories together had me curious for this film, but realising that none of the stories are good stories makes it disapointing."
Ghost Stories,33,16,audience,This is not Netflix 🙂
Ghost Stories,33,16,audience,"I would never recommend watching this movie.
It is not scary at all but, it is too gross.
The Anurag Kashyap's sequence is the worst of all 4. 
Please don't watch it if you want to save your precious 2 hours"
Ghost Stories,33,16,audience,"Very confusing and blant stories, without any frightening moments!"
Ghost Stories,33,16,audience,"Worst horror movie on Netflix. Now I regrate that why I have watched this. Half star for the 3rd one, otherwise , if you want to watch then it's better to watch any carrton"
Ghost Stories,33,16,audience,"I don't have patience to write up lengthy reviews for pretty stupid & dumb stuff, it'd help Netflix if it takes it down. It's that bad!"
Ghost Stories,33,16,audience,"Incoherent plot
Dull Colours
Disgusting but not scary at all"
Ghost Stories,33,16,critic,"
If only Ghost Stories had more shock and rattle written into its four segments, it would have given the crows something to crow about.
 "
Ghost Stories,33,16,critic,"
[The] varying quality isn't the only problem for Ghost Stories. In fact, the title itself feels wrongly hung on the whole thing. It's a simplification and a facade.
 "
Ghost Stories,33,16,critic,"
Ghost Stories is more hit than miss, as the non-horror auteurs mostly succeed in engraving genre tropes with their own names.
 "
Ghost Stories,33,16,critic,"
Kashyap's short is brilliant, as overtly disturbing as it is suggestive. The others are imminently skippable.
 "
Ghost Stories,33,16,critic,"
Overall, there's not enough sustained unease or a sense of dread or foreboding. Nor is there too much originality: I got flashes of John Krasinski's A Quiet Place, and Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca.
 "
Ghost Stories,33,16,critic,"
Janhvi Kapoor and Surekha Sikri with their quick silver expressions in the fleeting moments, captured up close and personal, are both quite a treat to watch.
 "
Ghost Stories,33,16,critic,"
Banerjee manages to hint at the internet shutdown in Kashmir, mob lynchings, and the steady erasure of minorities to pave the way for a Hindu Rashtra under one hour is unquestionably commendable.
 "
Ghost Stories,33,16,critic,"
As with any samplers... there are some tastes better left forgotten and others one hopes will be expanded into fuller, even more terrifying forms.
 "
Ghost Stories,33,16,critic,"
It should be noted that none of the four filmmakers - Anurag Kashyap, Zoya Akhtar, Dibakar Banerjee and Karan Johar - has made a horror movie before. God knows Johar has scared audiences, but this time, he's expected to.
 "
Hala,88,55,audience,"This film is so two-dimensional and superficially plotted that it collapses under any real scrutiny, it's attempt at examination of a complex cultural subject clearly offending and polarising some of it's audience, and while I commend the young lead actor for bringing depth to her role with an expressive performance and proficient use of a skateboard (and I hope and imagine it will be a good launch-vehicle for her), despite her character's somewhat unbelievable choices, I am left bewildered and annoyed that this production that would not look out-of-place at a second-year film student's festival screening has achieved flagship platform positioning on Apple TV+ they must have been desperate for diverse content, fair enough, but I do not recommend you watch this film as it will probably leave you confused, annoyed and possibly offended!"
Hala,88,55,audience,Very stereotypical and border line racist. It was an insult to religion and religious people
Hala,88,55,audience,The movie was boring and really doesn't have that much to it.
Hala,88,55,audience,Terrible movie sets a bad representation on Islam. The director obviously doesn't know that Muslims don't have to wear the Hijab and that it's not forced. The story is also showing that Muslims are bad and forcing things which they don't
Hala,88,55,audience,"O filme desempenha um papel de quebra de tabu cultural religioso, o que no meu ver foi algo incrível, além de abordar a dificuldade de lidar com problemas familiares e um misto de emoção."
Hala,88,55,audience,"Hala doesn't do anything new in the coming of age indie genre, but it quietly and effectively explores the tugs of assimilation for American children growing up in a foreign household. It's tremendously acted as well. While some may find the style of the film bland, others will enjoy its tranquil approach. However, it's important to note that it seems that many feel the film misrepresents how it is to be a hijabi in the States, and falls back on stereotypes."
Hala,88,55,audience,"One shouldn't expect a ""diverse"" character story be depicted as the perfect person in a perfect world cause there's nothing interesting about that. The fact that we lack diverse and/or muslim characters that are not the typical clichés depicted by western ppl/directors doesn't mean that the story of a muslim girl should be a sweetened version of what the reality is. The director chose to tell a story that she could relate too, and that many girls/persons could relate too also: the fact that her mom has difficulties to cope with her daughter becoming an adult, the pretend-to-be cool but absent father, the turmoil with the hormones and the curiosity about sex...all of these human issues to cope with when you grow up in a 1st-generation Pakistani-American very traditional family. I could totally relate to some of those topics (and don't have the same background at all), and even if they are muslims the issue is never really the religion but more how they chose to conduct their cultural behavior in the west according to what they have been thought in the ""homeland"". This is actually the Big dichotomy that provokes all the generational issues between 1st and 2nd generation immigrants. This coming-of-age drama might be a bit slow for some, but I like when we go deep into one character. Also the director took risks (like the last scene could be totally misinterpreted as anti-Islam), so shout to her and to this story about self-discovery."
Hala,88,55,audience,"Wonderfully written and beautifully directed by Minhal Baig, we follow the titular Hala in her last few months of high school, trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life, embracing her crush on a classmate and growing to understand that her home life isn't quite what she thought it was. The brilliance here is the change in how she (and in turn the we) see her mother and father at the start of the movie compared to the end. It's subtle, it's patient and it's really effective character development."
Hala,88,55,audience,"Stunning movie with great acting.  Very well written and presented regarding the challenges of a teenager growing up, cross culture issues, a family under significant stress."
Hala,88,55,audience,"the number of navel-gazey shots, slow-mo scenes, poetic voiceover and the dialogue were all too bland... the acting was that great either.
I did not like the approach of ""finding yourself"" that was equated with rejecting one's faith/culture while embracing ""white culture"". It could've been done differently (look at the TV show ramy ; where we actually knew what the main character thinks/feels). there is value in complexity in these stories, because these stories are complex. however with hala it was everything but that."
Hala,88,55,critic,"
All in all, Hala is wonderfully humanistic and is also one not to be missed.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
The filmmaker marries an American indie aesthetic with a uniquely immigrant narrative for something fresh, vital and worthwhile.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
I came to wonder if it's an adaptation of a short film. As it turns out, it is.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
How Hala allows its characters to navigate that messiness-how the film refuses to align itself with black and white presentations of ""good"" and ""bad""-is intentional and commendable.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
A coming-of-age story carried by the grace, sensitivity and emotional intelligence of the young actress Geraldine Viswanathan.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
The film shines with a glorious commitment to the emotional evolution of its female characters, which James Sizemore's score accents with notes of subtle agony.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Geraldine Viswanathan delivers a star-making performance in director Minhal Baig's terrific new Apple TV+ original film.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Young Australian Geraldine Viswanathan delivers a performance of tremendous poise, prowess and resonance in this affecting new coming-of-age film.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Hala shines a new light on the tropes of teenage self-discovery.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Sensitive and unsparing, Hala is a solid character study rooted in its perceptive skin. Thought-provoking and lyrical, Hala defines a certain type of referential glow that more teen girl-based dramas should follow with unshakable conviction.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Poetic coming-of-age tale tackles religion, youth with care.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Director Minhal Baig's attempts at cinematic lyricism, all slow motion and pensive strings on the soundtrack, make the movie do nothing so much as lie there on the page.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Viswanathan's resounding yet quiet performance allows the audience to see Hala for who she is - a smart, funny, intelligent, angsty, confused, and completely normal teenage girl.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Writer/director Minhal Baig's gentle and attentive sophomore feature Hala possesses something inherently extraordinary by just being about a young, female Muslim-American.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
A coming-of-age tale, a compelling directorial debut, and a slight corrective regarding both teen movies and the American Muslim experience.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Although its storytelling is at times naggingly staid, its central characterizations teem with complexity and sensitivity, and for that, it's a modest coming-of-age gem.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
As Hala tests the boundaries of faith and sexual desire (her name means ""halo"" in Arabic, and it feels like a burden), the movie is unsparing about gender roles and the awkwardness of first-time fumblings.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Baig has brought out a thought-provoking scenario that is both realistic and demands attention.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Baig's film is an introspective character study that's best in its quieter sequences. Viswanathan's insight into the character of Hala and Baig's knack for bringing that out cinematically make [...a...] wise and contemplative film.
 "
Hala,88,55,critic,"
Hala is ultimately an insightful, touching character study that forces us to reconsider what it means to be female, Muslim and American.

Good Newwz,75,64,audience,"No story, distilled comedy, waste of time"
Good Newwz,75,64,audience,"Nice script,nice direction,editing , total fun!"
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
Unfortunately, the complexity and depth inherent in the principal plot point remain beyond the ken of a screenplay that thrives on broad strokes.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
Overall, Good Newwz never tries to attempt something too ambitious or big or new. It's happy to be its good-looking safe self and that has worked in its favour.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
Slick Bollywood comedy about IVF has adult themes.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
Good Newwz has some great songs and apartment porn, but is a mess when it comes to the story it's trying to tell.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
An easygoing comedy that finds both genuine humour and pathos in a high-concept premise that's entirely possible in real life, Good Newwz is by far the best film released in 2019 to feature any of the four central actors.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
We get a talented cast led by Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor Khan, a story that resonates with parents and those desperate to begin their family, and a delightful mix of comedy and emotions that never gets preachy.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
The most dangerous thing about Good Newwz is that it's an easy crowd-pleaser. It isn't obviously apparent, but the film is narrated from a dizzying perspective of privilege.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
If Diljit Dosanjh's persona were a movie, I'd imagine it'd be something like this: genial, casual, comfortable with its blingy brightness, not particularly out to transform the world but impossible to resist.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
The good thing about Good Newwz then is that it gives [Akshay] Kumar a much needed opportunity to shed the boring nobility, let his hair down and play a normal man next door, one who can be despicable and offensive but perhaps not irredeemably so.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
Good Newwz is loud, silly and cheesy in places but is also funny by and large. It does make you laugh and hence this adult comedy is certainly worth a one-time watch...
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
The charms are few and far in between and for the most part, the movie just ends up stretching a one-line joke for far too long.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
In their previous outings, Kareena Kapoor and Akshay Kumar have been mostly wasted as a pairing. But they are in perfect sync in Raj Mehta's Good Newwz.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
Through much of its runtime, director Raj Mehta ensures that Good Newwz stays true to its genre with several light-hearted and funny moments. And the performances are top-notch, too.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
Good Newwz works best when it is being its bawdy, silly, raucous self.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
For Kumar, Kapoor Khan and some truly laugh-out-loud moments, Good Newwz is the lightness needed to round off the year.
 "
Good Newwz,75,64,critic,"
Raj Mehta extracts every bit of juice from this novel, insane idea.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,audience,"I have this problem where if I start a series, I intend to watch the entirety of it. I fully expected ""Dabangg 3"" to be nonsense, and it was, but it was also super boring. I think if they made an hour and a half movie with over the top fight scenes and music, I could accept it for mindless entertainment. However, this is never the case with these movies. As always, there is an attempt to create emotions and a story and it fails spectacularly. The movie's story does not make any sense and the origin story aspect is a total snooze fest. The villain in this movie is given no depth whatsoever and is just a bad guy who does bad things. Overall, it is a movie that drags for two and a half hours and is truly the worst entry in one of the worst Bollywood series I have ever seen."
Dabangg 3,20,46,audience,totally shity.......
Dabangg 3,20,46,audience,No Salman Khan anymore in any film and in any field.
Dabangg 3,20,46,audience,Budhau sathiya gaya hai
Dabangg 3,20,46,audience,"Poor acting , no story , poor villain . Even if u leave ur brains at home , you will not enjoy. Suggest you to even keep your eyes at home"
Dabangg 3,20,46,audience,Is ok same stunts same story
Dabangg 3,20,46,audience,It was great movie and a must watch entertainer... Salman Show Kiccha roacks
Dabangg 3,20,46,audience,"Dabangg 3 is everything you expect from modern Bollywood films.
D-"
Dabangg 3,20,46,audience,Language some where in not good. It’s not ok to watch with kids.
Dabangg 3,20,46,audience,"Too long and unnecessary songs, missed the point. Was fan of this series but disappointed at this one."
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
An overwhelming sense of ennui is inevitable as the film lurches from set piece to another.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
Salman Khan couldn't save the film. It had nothing we haven't seen already. Nothing we would want to see. 1 Quint out of 5!
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
Bollywood action threequel has music, humor, and violence.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
There are a few moments of promise - when the successful elements on the previous films remain intact - but they're ultimately outweighed by the number of disgraceful ones.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
Chulbul Pandey ki origin story which no one asked for, milegi yahaan.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
With loopholes and a little flawed writing, Dabangg 3 does leave you feeling a bit lost in a time when content-driven films are the trick of the trade. But it's a complete entertainer and has a good dose of the Salman Khan love and swag.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
The film has all the ingredients required for a massy masala entertainer - good action, music, drama and, of course, Salman packing all of this in one story.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
There's frantic action scenes to give you headaches and nasty jokes to make you nauseous.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
Dabangg 3, which has a long back-story of how Chulbul came to be called Chulbul, is not just a dreary mish-mash of the previous ones, it is also a cringe-fest.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
The tedium never lets up, and the heavily advertised dust-up between Chulbul and Bali is drowned in slow-motion and obvious wirework.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
Most of it is tedious, the action is familiar and stale, the songs are tributes to the older songs, and the slow-motion shots are so slow that characters seem to age and conduct silent conversations while being suspended in mid-air.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
The first few minutes of Dabangg 3 do an incredibly dedicated job of lowering expectations, foreshadowing in a way, the unpardonable daftness that makes up the film's 162-minute runtime.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
When so much time, talent and money is being expended to showcase the superstar, why not also provide him with a script?
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
""Dabangg 3"" is earnest, and it earnestly wants to deliver thrills. To do so, though, it would have to provide that other essential Bollywood ingredient: emotion.
 "
Dabangg 3,20,46,critic,"
There's nothing new or inspiring in Dabangg 3 and the degree to which you will enjoy this film depends largely on your devotion towards Khan.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,audience,"once again a stunner from #Mardaani team, it did not fail to deliver as expected. a action drama beautifully made. good selection of script by #Ranimukherji 
as the movie goes , serial killer brutally kills a girl,which comes in notice with shivani-inspector,in a hunch 2 find him she goes public abt finding killer, killer gets on cat-mouse game with shivani. so how does she tackle & will she able 2 capture him is the stry #thriller"
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
Mardaani 2 is never less than riveting.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
It all seems strangely clinical and mechanical. The patchy writing doesn't let the film become anything more than a formulaic exercise where the tough cop will get the bad guy and we forget all about it as soon as we leave the hall.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
This film is a worthy conversation starter and an admirable act of redemption for its star.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
What we get instead is a tired chess-game thriller between an egoistic criminal who wants to prove how clever he is because he seems to know he is in a movie...
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
Debutant Vishal Jethwa as the mysterious and egotist villain is spot-on. It's not easy to deliver such a confident performance, especially when you are cast opposite someone as seasoned as Rani but Vishal holds his own.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
Shivani exits the picture as quickly as she enters it, and a movie centred around a woman's achievements in a male-dominated world ends as hurriedly and bloodlessly as it began.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
The other problem, which is much more in our face, is the hammer-it-in approach when it comes to descriptions of 'mard' and 'aurat...'
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
The film engages with the gender issue in the all too familiar and stereotypical way, barely rising above being a cat-and-mouse thriller...
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
The film needed a more layered script - it has plot twists that stretch believability and the brutality becomes hard to watch.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
Mardaani 2 is a timely reminder of how good this industry can be when it chooses not to be weighed down by prejudice, market-driven compulsions and lazy formulae.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
The film may seem contrived with pop-feminism, there's enough suspense to keep us engaged.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
It's the conviction in the performances and a gripping narrative that ensure there's never a dull moment in Mardaani 2.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
Mardaani 2 is Rani Mukerji's show all the way and she lives and breathes her character.
 "
Mardaani 2,50,85,critic,"
Mardaani 2 frequently mistakes revenge with punishment and justice with an unchecked display of power. In that sense, it is even more depolorable than boastful the tone-deafness of Rohit Shetty's Simmba.

Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,audience,"FAKE STORY, OVERACTING, FALSE REPRESENTATION"
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,audience,This movie tried to be detailed account of the invasion a defense of the subcontinent but focused too much on the Sada shiv roa where as there were soo many complex and interesting characters that were a very important part of this conflict. This could have been a very interesting film but it seemed to be a glorified Bollywood style Tribute to the Maratha Valor.
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,audience,Distortion of history. 
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,audience,This was a great movie.
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,audience,"Pompous star-stuffed tragedy marred with surprisingly bad acting, shockingly bad direction, and soulless dialogues. This move feels fake!"
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,audience,Lead Actor's acting is awful
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,audience,It was interesting and watchable.
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,audience,Nice direction celated the era feels emotional
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,audience,dont able to see the movie due to Emg
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,audience,I enjoy Bollywood movies.  And this one was long at two hours and 51 minutes.  It's a war story and it had two dance routines.  It's part of what I love about these movies.  The end scene is gory with lots of deaths on the battlefield.  All in all I did enjoy it.
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
Falsification isn't the film's worst aberration... Panipat is anything but engaging.
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
Panipat: The Great Betrayal as it's called - feels like one too without the requisite emotional playoff or enough visually arresting scenes. In the end, it's all reduced to a boring history lecture that lasts almost 3 hours.
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
What could've been a worthy historical epic with all the visual ingredients and an interesting historical foundation in place is ultimately just a tired expression of Bollywood nationalism, with bad acting to boot.
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
This is an interesting chapter of history to revisit, because the winners were not the real heroes of the Third Battle of Panipat.
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
If you keep the history books aside and ignore his flaws, the depiction of the undisputed valour of Marathas such as him is brought up nicely in Panipat.
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
Gowariker may have taken liberties with history, but doesn't play around with the form. He sticks to the tried and tested, the long and langourous and old-fashioned. However, he is unable to achieve the epic sweep...
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
None of this bloodshed would have happened had these men just checked their egos...the political might, which becomes the flavour of this film, makes the storytelling easy to consume.
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
Ashutosh Gowarikar's film on the Third Battle of Panipat is needlessly elaborate, surprisingly progressive, but largely trite...
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
The screenplay is essentially a check-list of events that are being ticked off...
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
Watch the film for its opulence, it's well-choreographed fight scenes, as well as a colourful lesson in history. It might not be all accurate and yet gives you a sense of place and time...
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
Panipat delves into a significant chapter in history and is a war drama that lauds the unshakeable bravery, courage and the strong principles of the Marathas.
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
...did Panipat, which clocks in nearly three hours run time, need to be quite such a drudge?
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
Panipat is shorn of Padmaavat and Kesari's insidious intent, but it is not exactly an innocent, truthful chronicler of Indian history.
 "
Panipat - The Great Betrayal,43,65,critic,"
Overall, Panipat is an honest attempt at recreating the war that we only read in history books until now. It's a tribute to the Maratha community in its truest form and even it was shorter by an hour, it could have had the same impact.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,audience,"The movie is so well directed and they have chosen the perfect characters as well. Kartik, Bhumi and Ananya does a tremedous job here in pati patni or woh. You would definitely not regret watching this film. Some of the funny contents as well as some serious ones. Good film to watch"
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,audience,"Why does Karthik Aryan keep getting movies? He plays the same perpetually irritated, twitchy character over and over again. It's like he's trying to channel Govinda, but has none of the charm. Bhumi is lovely, but wasted in a short, pointless role. She still shines in several scenes. Ananya Pandey is ok. Both women are way too good for Karthik, in real and reel life. Aparshakti Khurana is a delight. He's repeated the same character in several movies too, but totally sparkles in it. He's the highlight of every scene he's in. The movie tries to be progressive at a very surface level, but with a male lead character so annoying, it falls totally flat. Sunny Singh still only has one expression for all emotions. Akhion se goli maare is one of the worst remixes ever - the composition, outfits, choreography - literally nothing works."
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,audience,"We are living in these times when the Bollywood small town romantic comedy has become a cliché, but then, only diligent filmmakers and great actors are trying their hands out in such films. And that is the exact strength of an otherwise low-IQ and finally cheap and low 'Pati, Patni Aur Woh'. Seriously the film could have been another 'Luka Chuppi' or something like been here seen that feel to it.  But a good update over the 1978 original and great performance of Bhumi Pednekar combined with the small-town texture do save the day for the film which is also progressive messaging. I especially enjoyed the film because it's nature is carefree. It's emotional arc might be unsatisfying. But the female leads here take stand, and have the best dialogues. The good-natured Chintu Tyagi (played by an in-form Kartik Aaryan) is a real loser, and his paan-chewing friend Fahim Rizvi (played by Aparshakti Khurana) is a smartie. But none of these match the 'swag' and 'savage' of Doga and Rakes Yadav, played by Sunny and Shubham respectively, both crushing and loving Vedika, the biggest strength of this fun romantic comedy which might be one of the best Hindi films of 2019.
Equally helping the film is it's local flavour. This is another level of masala movie: the romantic comedy is helped a great deal by the texture which nicely settles in and blends in with the cast which provides exceptionally fun performances. The nuances are catchy and beautiful, even if they lack in."
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
Passable.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
One wonders why a golden opportunity to explore the strain on modern day relationships is so callously missed. Prosaic formula killed this film& makes it staggeringly average despite Kartik, Bhumi, Ananya making the most of what they are given.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
The new Pati, Patni Aur Woh updates the story with neoteric ideas on masculinity and relationships in addition to good humour, suspense and star power.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
Just your garden-variety misogyny wrapped in a blanket of comedy...
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
What could have been funny falls flat.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
Writer-director Mudassar Aziz attempts to deliver a remake that is lively, funny and at least superficially, progressive - he doesn't always succeed but there is fun to be had here.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
Mudassar Aziz has tried to replicate the formula and has been more or less successful. He's taken the basic premise of the 1978 film and has woven a modern take on it, set in Kanpur.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
If only this new triangle had made more of Vedika's spunk, and Tapasya's spirit, it would have been a much more interesting take on contemporary marriages and more...
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
In 2019, the men as seen in this movie, are still taking women for granted, and the women, who maybe independent-spirited, are still responsible for forgiving and forgetting.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
The whole premise that a guy can so easily fool his wife and the woman he loves outside his marriage is so troubling.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
The stage-setting takes far too long, and the 128-minute movie gets going only after Chintu's balancing act becomes precarious...
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
If you are looking for some good entertainment this weekend, this one could be a delightful watch.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
Director Mudassar Aziz has put together a comedy that's perfect for a one-time-watch. It isn't life-altering, but makes for a pleasant watch.
 "
Pati Patni Aur Woh,43,36,critic,"
The film's dull, repetitive theatrics are derived only from the director playing up stereotypes.

Marjaavaan,8,,audience,The absolute sadness. The absolute Love. The 50% of the movie will ake you cry. I bet you at 50% of movie will make you cry too far. At hough point of the movie will make you to not expect to watch through end of the movie. But believe the end will make you fresh. Total fresh movie. Total sad movie. Must watch
Marjaavaan,8,,audience,"Unable to watch it on amazon, what would have happened in theatre"
Marjaavaan,8,,audience,well according to me its a great movie and if we talk about acting its better then ever Sidharth had done best in his carrer after his blockbuster EK villan and i think he can go further like moving his back nightmares
Marjaavaan,8,,audience,Very nice love story
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
Say yes to Marjaavaan at your own peril.
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
It's all hilariously over-the-top, made all the more enjoyable because the filmmakers are so earnest.
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
Marjaavaan attempts to check all the boxes for an emotional action rollercoaster, but its dated execution doesn't quite make the kill.
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
Marjaavaan is so hackneyed that even the usually restrained Malhotra is driven to intermittent over-acting during its two-hours-plus running time.
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
Marjaavaan is loud, overcooked and overdone. Turgid and tedious it just passes you by, without you caring for anyone or anything on the big screen.
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
Director Milap Zaveri doesn't bother with mundane filmmaking elements like transitions, cuts, continuity and beats...
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
The film is a blend of 80s and 90s Hindi film clichés with ear-splitting background music, bombastic dialogue-baazi and frantic over-acting.
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
Stuck in the 80s, it is the throwback you don't need.
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
The action scenes are slick and Zaveri remains loyal to the milieu and garnished speeches. It might have worked too, had the story had some heft, some surprises...
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
Overdramatic dialogues and a cliched story works against this Milap Zaveri directorial.
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
The film reads like a list of the worst of '80s clichés.
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
Dated, loud, cliché-ridden, preachy, unimaginative, boring, flat - that is what Marjaavaan is.
 "
Marjaavaan,8,,critic,"
Milap Zaveri's Marjaavaan is yet another pointless outing, based entirely on the idea of finding an excuse for two overgrown man-childs to glare at each other while threatening murder after every five minutes without actually doing anything.

Sibyl,56,29,audience,Remarkably works as a disjointed black comedy largely by the efforts of Efira is is magnetic despite the many foibles of her character
Sibyl,56,29,audience,I got terribly bored. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Sibyl balances romantic thriller and delicious drama with comic overtones about movie-making.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
""...it's Efira and Exarchopoulos holding this movie up with their impassioned performances, like a bent and battered wire hanger struggling to support an oversized wool sweater""
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
A mess Sibyl is, although at times it is a glorious one.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Triet ultimately doesn't deliver the film she perhaps intended to, with a title dedicated as it is to what is supposed to be the main character.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Lively performances almost make up for a perfunctory script.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Justine Triet's Sibyl descends from that old school tradition of softcore and heated melodramas. But the intervening years have informed her approach. She films her heroine from a self-empowered, and self-deluded, vantage point.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
It's amusing, but it's not terribly novel... It's very well-acted, funny, and Sandra Hüller, who plays the director of the film within the film, is hilarious.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Virginie Efira gives a tour-de-force performance.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
A film filled with quick-witted observations about vanity and delusion (self- and otherwise), Sibyl bracingly concludes with no moral to impart, no character truly redeemed.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
The observation that we're all actors in our narrative, and some are better at faking it than others, is what propels ""Sibyl"" to a smart, and emotionally resonant, ending.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
The buildup is greater than the payoff in this comic thriller that rarely finds new ground in its exploration of obsession and addiction.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
While I can see how this might have worked as a straight comedy or drama, the combination of the two tones never quite gels into a satisfying whole and it all just runs out of steam after a while.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Efira's beautifully controlled performance keeps us guessing whether she's the protagonist or the villain of the movie, or some combination of the two.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Rich in impulsive sensuality and knowing humor, the film captivates even as it stumbles through too many subplots.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Triet's direction is witty, regularly finding clever and disorienting ways to break in and out of scenes while the more predictable developments of the plot take unexpectedly elongated paths.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
That earlier film and its off-camera drama remain more compelling than anything in the busy and ultimately banal ""Sibyl.""
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Like its central character, Sibyl wants to have it too many ways, and the results aren't productive.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
It's a comedy of self-discovery, a drama of lingering addiction and a study of how even seemingly conquered traumas can devastatingly reassert themselves.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Whether psychological drama or sexual farce - and, really, there's no way to tell - ""Sibyl"" is a soapy mess.
 "
Sibyl,56,29,critic,"
Audiences may likely experience an emotional distance from and not an emotional attachment to the main character.

Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,audience,A nice portrait of a feisty food icon.
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,audience,"I went into this movie a bit concerned that it was about a colonialist song stealer, but she presents as an unyielding booster of Mexican regional cuisine and attributes her recipes to the chef she learned them from.  Progress of a sort..."
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
If it weren't for [Diana] Kennedy's sassy personality, the movie ... would actually be pretty dull. This is one of those laudatory celebrity documentaries where talking heads do nothing but praise the star of the movie.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
Nothing Fancy doesn't push quite enough at understanding what comes next, but as a presentation of Kennedy's contributions and her brusque singularity, it informs and entertains.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
This extremely talented, smack-talking British chef informed me that I've been making my guacamole all wrong.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
What Nothing Fancy manages is an intimate exploration of Kennedy's life, home and - most importantly - hunger, which is as ferocious as it was when she began her career many decades ago.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
...by one measure, I can consider it a success: I bought one of Kennedy's books the very next day.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
As she tastes the foods of the country, delighting in this old favorite or that new regional wrinkle on a traditional recipe, you may find yourself fretting that you're watching this on an empty stomach.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
A look at the lively life of the world's leading expert on Mexican food.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
Carroll clearly admires Diana Kennedy a great deal - and part of that admiration is to capture Kennedy as she is, sometimes surly and often passionate, curious and respectful of her adopted home.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
Directed by Elizabeth Carroll, the film provides that rare, genuine look inside a private and professional life
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
It's about as perfect a food doc gets.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
Foodies will marvel at the delectable dishes on display, but Kennedy is the star of her own show, and her fiercely independent attitude both inside and outside the kitchen is magnetic.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
It's a really likable documentary, even if you didn't know anything about [Diana Kennedy]... She's a really compelling subject.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
The pleasures of the film outweigh its careful reservations, mostly because Kennedy is simply too much fun to observe in her natural habitat.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
A much-needed perspective.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
Carroll does more than just offer a profile of one person, however celebrated, but instead makes of this portrait a moving celebration of life in all its boundless glory.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
The fact that Carroll and her crew choose to focus on the individual makes for a more engaging narrative, but the lack of broader context sometimes feels like a missed opportunity.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
[Elizabeth] Carroll beautifully weaves this nine decade-long story into a humorous and engaging one that will make you cherish the contributions of Kennedy.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
What remains is a lively and uncritical portrait of a woman as passionate about composting as chilaquiles, one who will pitch a fit if you put garlic in your guacamole.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
A vivid and inspiring profile, adoring but not adulatory.
 "
Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy,100,,critic,"
In this time of peril and chaos, Elizabeth Carroll's documentary is a balm for the soul.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,audience,"Saint Frances is one of the best indies of the year due to its excellent script and amazing dialogue. This is a textbook example of how to turn a tired premise into something genuinely deep and moving as the film deals with motherhood in a particularly honest, inspired manner. The performances are strong across the board, the movie has a lot of heart and it's a breezy, engaging watch due to its effectively short runtime."
Saint Frances,99,79,audience,"The scenes with Maya and Frances were lovely...Maya was an awesome nanny and Frances was cool. But the film and characters moved from dealing with female body issues in a matter of fact and hence normalising way, such as the scene near the beginning normalising period blood in sex, to wallowing in them. The result was hence a portrayal of the women in the film, and hence women in general, as victims."
Saint Frances,99,79,audience,Boring movie for feminists.
Saint Frances,99,79,audience,"I loved this movie so much. Super sweet, maybe a touch sappy, but also modern, sophisticated, real. Really heart centered movie featuring strong female characters, dealing with real female issues. Just full of goodness. Loved it."
Saint Frances,99,79,audience,Poor chick flick with a rather distasteful and flippant coverage of abortion
Saint Frances,99,79,audience,"Ordinarily, there's a good chance I would've overlooked this film as it really didn't strike me as something of interest. However, some positive word of mouth and its availability on Netflix convinced me otherwise and I'm very glad I gave it a chance. This is a delightfully refreshing human story that's told with an abundance of wit and honesty and it's very positive to witness a female centric film that addresses everything from menstruation to abortion with a genuine honesty and nonjudgmental approach. Anchored by two performances of great substance and nuance by Kelly O'Sullivan (who also wrote the screenplay) and young Ramona Edith Williams as the titular Frances. Two superb performances that bring out the heart and soul of the film."
Saint Frances,99,79,audience,What a beautiful film.  Highly recommended.  Easily one of the best films of the year --that you may not hear about.  Seek it out.
Saint Frances,99,79,audience,"Absolutely incredible! Such an inspiring and beautifully crafted movie that deftly explores so many real, and weighty issues with aplomb, unbridled compassion and real warmth. I laughed, I felt pride, and I cried... Kelly O'Sullivan has stolen my heart, and I'm genuinely pleased she has"
Saint Frances,99,79,audience,"Pretty wonderful all around, Saint Frances lived up to my high standards for the Sunday night movie. Kelly O'Sullivan comes really out of nowhere for me to not only give a stellar performance in the lead role, but also pen this excellent screenplay, and throw in an executive producer credit as well. 
Other fine performances came from Charin Alvarez, Lily Mojekwu, Max Lipchitz, and especially the rather precocious (sorry, but it really fits her) Ramona Edith Williams as Frances/Frannie.
Great use of tone here, along with a delicate but pragmatic touch with sensitive though very natural recurring experiences that will no doubt be off-putting for some, still. In the hands of some directors, such subject matter could've been handled (mishandled) clumsily, taking away from the overall effect of the film. Extra credit there for director Thompson, but I'm thinking a lot of that can be traced to working with O'Sullivan, who again was fantastic. 
Much the same can be said of the religious elements that come into play. I never really felt that the screenplay got preachy or didactic in any Catholic/non-secular way. I even felt the scene in the confession as just another case of Bridget getting more relief and absolution of a sort that was needed. She may lie a lot, and need to work on why, but she's also brave, which she needs to never change. 
The unnecessary last scene between Bridget and Frannie seemed a  bit of a stretch for me, but I'll offset that with the scene with good ol' busybody Joan in the park. Clam up, Joan. 4 stars"
Saint Frances,99,79,audience,"fantastic characture of a woman trying to cope with adulthood and the consequences of her actions. lighthearted, but fierce when it needs to be, this movie will run you through the emotional gauntlet. More than once I found myself cracking up while my cheeks were still a little soggy from tear trails induced by a recent scene. Good stuff. I wont soons forget this indie gem."
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
This funny, heart-wrenching and gorgeously shot tale of a 30-something woman finding herself exudes warmth, kindness and humour.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
I don't recall the last time I saw so many strong female characters in a film who all shared so many emotionally powerful scenes together.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Saint Frances is smart and original and anti-sensationalist. It is also a very good film, which speaks to you but never shouts.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Talking about awkward things without shame is what this film endorses - and does well.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
I do wish ""Saint Frances"" indulged in or two fewer getting-to-know-you montages. But I say that about most every movie that comes along, even the good ones.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Saint Frances is a fine addition to a new generation of American films that seek to break taboos on subjects too long considered untouchable.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Effortlessly real and charming, Saint Frances is an absolute winner.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Saint Frances is a smart movie about empowerment, that doesn't feel like a message movie. It carefully studies life's most constant aspect, change.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Saint Frances is one of far too few movies that approaches all of these realities with eyes wide open.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Edgy feminist drama removes judgment from sex, abortion.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
[Kelly] O'Sullivan's screenplay, much like her performance, is sweet without ever turning sickly. Alex Thompson's direction, in turn, carefully matches her tone.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Like all the best films about fumbling your way through to deeper self-understanding, Saint Frances doesn't feel too programmed, and leaves a lot of mess on the table.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Saint Frances' mix of humour and bold-faced reality is a unique and necessary (re)vision for these modern times
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Funny and challenging, complex and at times transcendent.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
It's the type of film that pulls the audience in with familiarity, only to end up leaving them spiritually and emotionally fulfilled while entertaining them.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
The film eventually delivers some powerful and touching moments.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
First-time feature director Alex Thompson, working with a screenplay from partner and lead actress Kelly O'Sullivan, has made an adulting comedy that steers clear of the worst talky, navel-gazing indulgences of the genre.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
A gem that is profound and topical.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Loosely structured, but satisfactory in its narrative shape, the picture deftly escorts us through the embarrassments and dilemmas of everyday life in a hipper part of Chicago.
 "
Saint Frances,99,79,critic,"
Saint Frances is, above all else, an honest and intelligent film that offers a smart perspective on the pressures placed upon women in their thirties.
 "
Clemency,92,65,audience,no interesting story here - just a soap box.
Clemency,92,65,audience,"In some scenes Alfre Woodard reaches a place that seems beyond acting. She makes involuntary intakes of breath feel like a trembling of the soul. Aldis Hodge is also excellent. Tough, terse filmmaking. Doesn't need to preach. The moral outrage is clear through the actions and emotions."
Clemency,92,65,audience,Not the usual prison tale that not only has such an interesting dilemma at it's core but also doubles as a character study for the female protagonist.
Clemency,92,65,audience,Hard to watch but surely true to life...and death.
Clemency,92,65,audience,The acting is excellent but Clemency is a boring movie.
Clemency,92,65,audience,"Clemency is an intense, slow burning drama featuring excellent acting. Bernadine Williams is a prison warden, a role she has held for a long time. It has taken a toll on her personal life with her long time husband feeling weighed down by the dire aspects of her job. The film begins with an execution that goes wrong and then leads into an upcoming one involving Anthony Woods, a convicted killer who has been on death row for over 7 years. So the film goes back and forth between the stresses on Williams' personal life and also the ongoing drama surrounding the execution of Woods. The film can be too dour at times with events suufocating the life out of the film. But the acting is first class, especially from Alfre Woodard and Aldis Hodge."
Clemency,92,65,audience,Important. Gripping. Amazing performances.
Clemency,92,65,audience,"Prison warden Bernadine Williams has spent years delivering death row executions and it is starting to take it's toll on her marriage and her emotional and psychological wellbeing.  As she prepares to sanction the execution of another she finds herself facing the strain of taking the lives of so many and must reconcile with herself to get her life back on track. 
As you can imagine from the subject matter, this film goes to some dark places and leaves the viewer in the shoes of the central character, asking the question could you carry out the job and just see it as a job and nothing more?   It's a harrowing film that is led by a strong lead in Alre Woodard.  It's powerful and unflinching in it's subject matter and it was interesting to see this kind of story told from a very different perspective.  That are so many movies about lawyers and prisoners fighting for their cause on death row but this is the first I have seen from the other side and it's one that won't easily be forgotten."
Clemency,92,65,audience,I didn't like the writing. But Alfre Woodard was outstanding.
Clemency,92,65,audience,"A moving powerful film at anytime. Breathtaking performances all round. Easily worthy of some well deserved awards.
The crescendo with Alfre Woodard provides an emotionally moving experience that you could watch again and again."
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
The film is a tough watch emotionally, though the performances are stronger than the film itself.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
Clemency is proof of just how effortlessly [Woodard] can lead a film.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
The acting is excellent (particularly Woodard and Hodge), even if the characters aren't written with traditional, fiction-based range.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
Clemency has a lot to say. But it says it well.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
Worth watching for the strong performances from Aldis Hodge and especially leading actress Alfre Woodard who should be in the conversation for Best Actress.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
With Woodard and Hodge delivering phenomenal performances, Clemency emerges as an extraordinary feat in film-making that is as unflinching as it is poignant.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
Clemency is hauntingly effective.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
The usual cliché with films of the nature of CLEMENCY is they are 'difficult to watch', but to say that would overlook the reality that Chukwu's film is engaging and thoughtfully constructed.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
Clemency rests almost entirely on Woodard's shoulders, and she delivers a performance of real intelligence.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
A masterwork.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
Clemency is a powerful and unflinching look at the role of those who must carry out the death penalty...
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
Woodard, unshowy and preternaturally still, offers us a stubborn professional being steadily eaten up by her involvement with the glacially slow killing-machine.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
But for its first hour at least, its clean, meticulous style serves as a rapt counterpoint to Woodard's mesmerising performance.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
Woodard and Hodge are faultless as two people moulded by a relentless, cynical system. One of 2019's best films.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
It takes an actor of Woodard's calibre to show us how Bernadine arrived at this point, and why she finds herself so conflicted.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
Clemency is one of those deliberately harrowing movies that leaves you feeling elated. The very precision of the film-making gives you a sense of hope.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
[Woodard] is astounding and this film is deeply moving.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
The moral and ethical debates around the death penalty rarely touch on the toll it takes on the people involved, but that's the grey area writer-director Chinonye Chukwu explores with a humanist's touch and an keen ear for all her characters.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
Chukwu's devastating and complex character study advances the discourse around capital punishment beyond the usual contrived talking points.
 "
Clemency,92,65,critic,"
It's a towering performance from Woodard, her career masterpiece, and she is first among equals in an outstanding cast.
 "
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,audience,"I'm seriously perplexed at why this film doesn't have better reviews? This is one of, if not the best, Natalie Portman performance I've ever seen. Not as dark or deep as Joaquin Phoenix in Joker but I still got that vibe of someone who's slowly losing touch with reality. She's strong, smart, and fierce at times. Wonderful editing with a lot of overhead shots and camera zooms to heighten Portman's isolation. And on a final note: after seeing him in this and RICHARD JEWELL recently, I'm convinced Jon Hamm doesn't have to stretch his acting chops very much to pull off playing an a--hole. I have nothing against the man and his work is spotty for me at times, but recently, he just comes across as that a--hole (so kudos to him). Looking forward to another viewing and I hope Natalie not only gets an Oscar nomination but wins the damn thing! I would definitely have to update my Top Ten list of 2019 and include this film in there."
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,audience,"On paper it has a sensational director, an indie-driven cast and everything you need to be a success. Except, likeable characters and a screenplay with interesting dialogue. These are the worst kinds of disappointments."
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,audience,"I saw someone online say this is better than 'Interstellar', and that statement alone nearly made me hurl.

Like, in what way is this boring drivel better?

I watched this on a plane last year, before the COVID outbreak where you could go anywhere, good times. Anywhere, even on a flight journey this couldn't hold my interest.

I liked the TV show 'Legion', a show created by Noah Hawley, but man his directing here is so terrible. Every choice he made was the worst. The number of times the aspect ratio keeps changing I thought I was watching 'Transformers: The Last Knight' again."
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,audience,Not too bad. Visually pleasing.
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,audience,"This is underrated - while it is a bit confusing, in fact there is a good film in here, with an interesting metaphor around obsessive ambition and losing control  - and recovery from that by coming 'back down to earth'"
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,audience,"I liked  liked this movie. Natalie Portman is incredible. She creates a powerfully sympathetic character. It is hard to watch Lucy fall apart, and we do slowly see this happen. You really do feel how life starts to challenge her."
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,audience,"The film IS jumbled and confused in a number of ways and relies on a couple of hackneyed character and plot devices but the mind blowing awe and wondrous, breathless marvels of being aloft in space above the blue marble of Earth that dominates the opening sequences followed by the disorienting (as it must be) return to terrafirma (and its attendant sense of smallness after being out in the universe in the depths of one's aloneness and wholeness or connected-to-the-all-ness) is worth the price of admission.  No other film involving astronauts and space that I have seen has ever quite captured that the way this does.  Hence the third star."
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,audience,"I will be the contrarian here and say that I liked this movie. Since this is about NASA, I will get ""scientific"" here:
PROS
Natalie Portman, Natalie Portman, and Natalie Portman
CONS
The ""character arc"" is flawed. We, the audience, are never briefed on why she suddenly becomes crazy. Sure, she enjoyed being in space as a transcendental experience and wants to go back. Who wouldn't? 
But we don't know how to feel about her. Is she cracking up from stress, childhood problems, boredom, or something else. Why should we care about her? Should we feel sympathetic? 
If I could play amateur screenwriter, I would do flashbacks about her childhood showing how her strict parents raised her to be an overachiever. I would show a scene where she was punished for getting the SECOND highest grade in an important test. I would show her as a child playing with astronaut dolls and escaping her dark reality by pretending she is floating in space, free of her parents'  NOW, we would feel sympathetic to her and understand why she acts like she does. We could understand why she treats her daughter like she was treated - harshly and uncompromisingly, where second best ain't good enough.
Hollywood... I'm available! lol"
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,audience,"This will end up being a cult classic. Natalie portman is badass and plays a great role of a strong woman stuck in societal circumstances. Not confusing, existential and metaphorical journey of feeling disconnected and finding what it is to truly belong."
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,audience,"Apollo 13.  First Man.  Hidden Figures.  And now, Lucy in the Sky.  What do all these movies have in common???  They're all fact based dramas involving NASA and they are all too boring to watch again.  I've barely seen any of Apollo 13 because it makes me want to go to sleep or ram my head into a wall within the first ten minutes.  I just don't care about Hollywood's serious take on NASA stories for subconscious reasons that are probably easy to deduce if thought about.  

Plain and simple, Lucy in the Sky is a boring story about someone who was probably a pretty boring person.  Some of the most interesting names in Hollywood were involved in this movie but even they couldn't make it interesting.  It's no more interesting a story than almost anyone else has.

Best thing about this story and movie - it shows that even astronauts make fairly big mistakes in life, but that doesn't earn it any points in my book because it mostly just encourages people to make mistakes.

Hawley articulates Lucy's mental breakdown as if running through an uninspired checklist of bourgeois female suffering that he hopes will compensate for a lack of character building.

But just when... director Noah Hawley is beginning to say some quite interesting things about the damaging hormonal high potentially produced by space travel, the film falls apart... and descends into near-endless melodramatic tedium.
 "
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,critic,"
Without a doubt, Hawley is one to watch. He's one of the most visually daring directors working at the moment. But here, the material runs away with him.
 "

It's proper acting, from one of the modern greats.

Directed by Noah Hawley - the showrunner of the most-excellent Fargo - Lucy In The Sky completely misses the point of virtually everything it tries to tackle.

By failing to find the solid ground in [Lisa] Nowak's story, Lucy in the Sky leaves us stranded in the stars.
 "
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,critic,"
An interesting take on the transformative nature of space travel and its effects on those who experience it. Sadly though, there isn't enough here in the way of a plot, or much else really, to warrant the film's excessive two hour running time.
 "
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,critic,"
A flimsy, effortful project that simply has no footing either as fact or convincing fiction. It's in freefall from the word go.
 "
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,critic,"
[Natalie] Portman has a great track record of playing women under extreme psychological pressure and this turn is equally Oscar-worthy. Unfortunately, the film supporting her, over-directed by TV's Noah Hawley, isn't of the same calibre.

Lucy in the Sky wastes Natalie Portman in a film that fails to grasp that not every story about women is one of empowerment.
 "

There are times when the movie feels untethered to how people would actually behave, but films aren't real life even if there're based on actual events. I was willing to let Hawley tell his kind of story. I didn't mind its ragged moments.

Lucy in the Sky,21,31,critic,"
Part art house film and part true crime tabloid serial, the jumbled, wacky, true story is perfectly conveyed through this suitably oddball movie.

""While the film does grant its story some emotional gravitas, it gets lost in the existential crisis of it all.""
 "
Lucy in the Sky,21,31,critic,"
By trying to hold back for so long, Lucy in the Sky fails to prepare itself for the tone change it knows is coming, and burns up spectacularly upon impact.

Peppermint,12,70,audience,"Ignore the critics they have zero idea what they are talking about. Jennifer Garner is great and the movie is straight up an hour and a half of continuos action. Riley North is not some overpowered douche that beats everybody up, just because. She gets beaten up in almost every scene. She is hurt but goes on. She is human, first of all. And this is a great example of how a strong female character should be written for an action movie. Yes the movie has its flaws but this is the best action movie I have seen in the last 10 years (and yes I am even including the marvel action movies). No fancy cgi, just plain ol' action scenes. I do not get the critics score, come on who doesn't wanna see Jennifer Garner be a badass for 90 minutes!? Watch the movie if you want to see a great action movie."
Peppermint,12,70,audience,Girl power and empowering!
Peppermint,12,70,audience,Proof  you can't make a warrior woman out of a soccer mom. Old revenge plot of training up to wipe out your hurtful folk. Goes south early. Jennifer Garner acts like a flexi piece of celery.
Peppermint,12,70,audience,"Utter rubbish. Terrible script, bad acting and every cliche in the book with regard to the plot. Jennifer Garner must have been desperate for the money to ever have her name anywhere associated with this heap of crap. What a waste of everyone's time!"
Peppermint,12,70,audience,"Frank Castle is one of my favorite characters of all time, so naturally, I was a little apprehensive about a possible Punisher ripoff. In the end, my suspicions were confirmed; Riley North is a female Frank Castle, who is not the badass the description claims. Her fighting skills are laughable and she has no depth whatsoever, unlike Frank, who is beyond amazing in a fight and has one of the deepest and most heart-wrenching stories of all time. Jennifer Garner did her best, but she just can't compare to Jon Bernthal's Frank Castle.
   There's very little action in the first half of the movie, and although I tried to pay attention to the story, everything was pretty dull. The actual action was cut to bits, and the gangsters could not aim for their life. Literally. Speaking of the gangsters, all the villains are Latino gang stereotypes, so don't expect much positive diversity in this film.
   Don't bother watching. If you're scrolling through Netflix looking for a bloody revenge story, start The Punisher (the show, not the movies). It has amazing action and profound emotion, and is much better than Peppermint."
Peppermint,12,70,audience,"A standard revenge thriller with a great committed performance by Garner as the lead, but otherwise very forgettable.  Slow to start, the plot is riddled with clichés, dull villains, a weak support cast and an unsurprising twist, but it does have a few good moments in it to make it watchable.  Very cliché and unbelievable, but I was rooting for her throughout."
Peppermint,12,70,audience,"Love this movie.  Talk about the wrath of a woman scorned, The left no stones unturned to get her revenge.  Enjoyed this so much."
Peppermint,12,70,audience,Nice action movie. Jennifer was born for these kind of roles.
Peppermint,12,70,audience,"Ennesimo revenge movie di cui, probabilmente, non si sentiva il bisogno.
Tutto sommato la prima parte mantiene un buon ritmo, senza soffermarsi più del dovuto sullo stato d'animo della protagonista.
Nel finale ci si accontenta della solita piramide di violenza che termina con lo scontro con il grande antagonista; davvero nulla di nuovo."
Peppermint,12,70,audience,"A 12% on the tomatometer makes me think this website is broken. Good movie - decent acting, great action, no stupid pulling of punches. It's not The Shawshank Redemption, but it's way better than Wonder Woman 1984."
Peppermint,12,70,critic,"
John Ortiz caps off the action with one of the silliest speeches in action movie history. And that bar is pretty high.
 "
Peppermint,12,70,critic,"
The movie's feints toward ""fun"" are awkward, and Morel's lack of interest in even the most basic details feels downright contemptuous.
 "
Peppermint,12,70,critic,"
It is a completely different kind of hole-some than we're used to associating with Garner. This time around, the 'hole' is in the plot, and when the credits finally roll, we definitely do not want 'some' more.

Do you want to see Jennifer Garner be a bad ass for 90 minutes or not? Of course you do.

Operates on the most basic, unoriginal, uninspired revenge fantasy design, so that it rarely feels like anything other than a remake of overly familiar vigilante epics.

Peppermint is wildly hypocritical with its fair share of laughably bad moments in the first half, but once those bits subside, it becomes increasingly icky and boring.

Jennifer Garner is the saving grace of Peppermint, but even her performance isn't enough to prevent this from being a 'here today, gone tomorrow' kind of film.

Puzzle,83,75,audience,"Awful. A forty something woman played by Kelly McDonald begins learning puzzles from an Asian creep she befriends. She's bored with her life, lacks excitement and feels trapped in the usual routine. Bland. I could see Gordon Ramsay offloading on this had it been on kitchen nightmares with some seasoning. There's not much going on, a stale dialogue and to be truthful I wasted time viewing this. Doesn't take much working out a dependant woman bored with her chores with her life (although her hairy overweight dull husband works a lot to afford the bills) that's not enough for her she wants to find herself. Awkward, bland and just awful!!"
Puzzle,83,75,audience,"A beautiful study of someone belatedly finding their place in life with an understated tour de force from Kelly MacDonald as the central character. 
Intelligent and thought provoking with a moral dilemma central to the storyline that the film plays out in a non-judgmental manner."
Puzzle,83,75,audience,"Episode 6938 of ""Desperate Housewife"" and scripted by pseudo-intellectuals: her husband shatters a tray to her, and she learns to repair it by becoming national jigsaw puzzle champion. Will anything change in their lives? Yes, no, who cares.
(Mauro Lanari)"
Puzzle,83,75,audience,"Excellent film. ""Puzzle"" is one of those rare movies that rises above so many dramas today that have to have an 'edge' - here is a rather straightforward story of a wife and mother, Agnes (played brilliantly by Kelly MacDonald) who seems simple, almost slow when we first are introduced to her. Then, she gets a jigsaw puzzle as a birthday gift and finishes it in no time. From there, it just evolves in to a taut and heartrending story of family, community and, yes, even faith, as Agnes starts an unexpected journey of self-realization and awareness. All the main players - Denman, Khan, Abrams, Weiler - are outstanding. A realistic and well developed film showing what real people with real lives actually do in managing through day to day life. See it."
Puzzle,83,75,audience,Love Kelly MacDonald and love this quirky little indie flick.
Puzzle,83,75,audience,"A strange film that while being neither very hard-hitting or deep and neither too alight and pointless, it's a well crafted and fun watch that's as smooth as the sip of a first pint and on its own, just as pointless.

I watched with a fan of puzzles who wanted to see it as a result of all the trailer lines that this movie has in it. And for her, it satisfied, all except the ending. I get that the ending can't be Kelly MacDonald's character having another strong man take her under his wing, however the politics of her actually taking him for a ride, using and abusing him and then leaving him when she needs him, is quite tough to swallow. 

Without learning anything about this tender lost soul (Irrfan Khan) we're left to wonder why his wife left him, why he's bereft of ideas, how much and for what reasons he loved Kelly MacDonald. I kept waiting for these pieces like a puzzle to fall in to place and the movie resists us. It may have been trying to avoid cliche and show him as part of her growth, and centre the film around her blossoming in to a strong independent person, but then they should have thought about making him less likeable and relatable, fun, and in desperate need of companionship. It feels like her journey was almost entirely selfish, breaking the hearts of two men in the process, one of whom they have to make slightly aggressive in an ugly, ham-fisted way.

This leads in to the messy ending that feels unearned and undermined by the preceding few minutes. And while it's nice to see a film about someone slightly different without having to label her with a malady of some kind, it's a wash with not knowing what story it wants to tell and what film it wants to be. In terms of pacing and photography it looks like an affordable little film made extremely well. And I have to say for the most part I did enjoy it. But the pieces did not all fall together perfectly and unfortunately Puzzle is missing a few pieces hardyhardyhar etc etc guffaw aren't i funny."
Puzzle,83,75,audience,"Puzzle is a quiet film about all the things you don't say, don't want to think, pretend aren't a part of you, and never try to understand and then the catalyst that disrupts the placid surface. Kellie Macdonald is one of my favourite actresses and is simply not in enough films. In every role she imbues so much emotion even when silent. 
I felt a weird personal connection to her character, Agnes, because I'm also very good at puzzles and annoy my family because I'll finish them in one sitting when they'd plan to casually work on it over the holidays. It made me a bit paranoid hoping I wasn't too much like Agnes who has lived a very sheltered and submissive life without much curiosity about anything different. 
I do think her and her puzzle partner form a close bond, but doubted if it was really a romantic love and not just a kindred spirit type friendship. But maybe that's why it ends like it does. 
It also made me want to do a puzzle."
Puzzle,83,75,audience,"The compactness is missing, ergo the procedure comes off slow, not the pace but the disclosure of the layer.

Puzzle

Turtletaub has a whole different problem to solve at first. It is painful to see him work his way out. Probably because he didn't dig it up. This is coming from the script. Not to say, he isn't to be blamed. The director Marc Turtletaub ought to and has to place himself as a bridge, productive, helpful, comforting catalyst simplifying the complex themes attempted to score by the writers. And what makes it more sad is that the actors on the other hand are diving deep in their roles, embodying a troubled personality fluently. Kelly Macdonald as a catholic women is something I don't get completely but am in sync with what she is announcing without a podium.

Her sweetness, I-am-sorry attitude and easily-influenced personality is what's essentially grabbing us. Convincing us to stay on the track for when she hits the train and goes rogue, those very behavior darkens the tone in the film. Irrfan Khan is the supporter, her partner and that is what he stays. All the time, all the way. He is the perfect anecdote to the world she has been revolving around.

She states it clearly when she defines him, he is not like anything, anyone she has ever come in contact with. This is where the film gets stuck into another issue. It desperately needs a narrator. The characters often goes irrelevantly loud, guiding us where, what or in which state they are. Unfortunately, the core equation, between Khan and Macdonal, is the very relationship that never spoke to me. You feel skipped, left out and rushed away from making sense. There is very less justification, in the sense that not everything might line up, smoothly. It shouldn't be this hard for us to believe in the experience that they share, they go through, it shouldn't be a Puzzle."
Puzzle,83,75,audience,Opening sequence is mild stunner that sets up the entire story. Satisfying ending. MacDonald and Denman give nuanced affectiing performances. 
Puzzle,83,75,audience,"Life's pieces don't always fit together as well as we'd like, and ""Puzzle"" (available on DVD and streaming) shows us just that, albeit a little all too well. While all the elements of a realistic, superbly nuanced picture are present (especially when it comes to reflecting the story's central theme), the film could nevertheless use a little more glue to hold the pieces together more effectively. The fine performances of Kelly Macdonald, David Denman and Irrfan Khan truly make this offering worth watching, though don't be surprised if you sometimes find yourself even more frustrated than the characters themselves while watching this one."
Puzzle,83,75,critic,"
The movie takes a few shortcuts that make for some abrupt plot points, but it hardly matters given Macdonald's performance.
 "
Puzzle,83,75,critic,"
Puzzle is a low-key crowdpleaser. Take it for what it is and enjoy.

The real reason for catching Puzzle... is the old-fashioned pleasure of experiencing a meeting of two unusual minds.

This film is very well put together, and it shows how making one small change can lead to unexpected adventure.

It's a showcase for Macdonald, and 22 years on from Trainspotting the Scottish actress displays a mixture of soulful struggle and defiant will to change.
 "

There is kind and winning quality to it but it almost seemed... too small for the big screen. I couldn't shake the feeling throughout that had I seen it streaming on Netflix I would probably have far warmer feelings for it.
 "
Puzzle,83,75,critic,"
Despite this crying out to be described in jigsaw puns, I'll simply say that Kelly Macdonald as the blossoming Agnes blows everyone out of the water in a performance of subtle intensity and humour, and leave it at that.
 "
Puzzle,83,75,critic,"
Kelly Macdonald shines in the lead. Her face is a powerfully expressive text ... representing hairpin turns of understanding and decision that are always convincing.
 "
Puzzle,83,75,critic,"
Thoroughly simplistic and profound, Puzzle is a poignant and insightful character study of domestic alienation looking to take some time off for poetic evaluation.
 "
Puzzle,83,75,critic,"
... this film carries a steady, oceanic emotional undercurrent in a light package.
 "

As the character grows Macdonald's performance gets even more complex, and even when the story gets a little formulaic the emotional investment remains.

As someone else said, McKinnon hammed it up a bit, but that is kind of her style so what do you expect? Outside of that I thought the chemistry between the leads was great and the comedy was generally very funny. For the complaints about the violence, while it is a comedy, it is also an action movie. And for those that complain about the profanity and brief nudity I am pretty sure if genders were reversed there would be much less of an outcry. Overall fun movie. Recommended."

Hamm finds himself caught between the US agency manipulation and trying to free his friend who he left behind.  It seemed like an episode from Homeland with no high speed chases or high flying bullets just smart excellent script with a good cast that also included Rosamund Pike, Mark Pellegrino and Dean Norris. It was so sad to see such a beautiful country torn to pieces. I am afraid I will never see my birthplace in my lifetime.  Overall it was a good captivating movie with a good cast."
Beirut,82,56,audience,Just couldn't shake the feeling I was watching a B movie. Jon Hamm just not charismatic enough to carry a movie as the main actor. 
Beirut,82,56,audience,"This was a great movie for people who know something about the MidEast. The population born after 1984 probably will not be as transfixed. I remember the massacre at Munich and the car bomb in the Marine barracks, the two events which bracket the action. This has all the best elements of a John Le Carre novel (and better than most adaptations of the same). Who's the enemy, who's the ally, what's the fight about. The motivators are political and personal. The obstacles moveable."
Beirut,82,56,audience,"Beruit is a well plotted spy thriller, full of intrigue and complex Middle East politics. The movies got superb casting and performances, great production values with the historical setting, makes it feel all so real.  It does get confusing at times with all the different factions, everyone's having their own agenda, but all is clear by the end delivering us a gripping drama. "
Beirut,82,56,audience,"Beirut is an exciting political thriller that's full of intrigue.  The story follows a former US diplomat who's recruited by the CIA to negotiate a hostage exchange in Beirut, but when internal politics get in the way he's forced to go outsider of official channels to save the hostage.  Starring Jon Hamm, Rosamund Pike, and Mark Pellegrino, the film has a pretty strong cast.  And it does a good job at creating tension and suspense.  Also, the costumes and sets are especially well-done, creating an authentic look and feel for the time period.  However, it can be a little confusing to follow the different political factions and the deals and trades being made.  Yet despite a few script problems, Beirut is an intense and gripping drama."
Beirut,82,56,audience,Jon Hamm does a splendid job. The movie keeps everything on the edge. Well done suspense thriller with not too many irrelevant twists and turns. Standard average thriller.
Beirut,82,56,audience,"Beirut was ok, your typical international spy chess match. Jon Hamm and Rosamund Pike delivers good performances. I just wasn’t into it too much. "

After years as Don Draper, Jon Hamm shows a new side as a U.S. diplomat in Tony Gilroy's intricate political thriller.

 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
No doubt, this is Hamm's finest role to date after his Mad Men series...
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
Not much that you haven't seen before, from the war-torn Middle Eastern city setting to exchanges illuminated by headlights, but it's still worth a look thanks to the intelligence and political clout of Gilroy's script combined with Hamm's star power.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
There's political intrigue abound in Beirut. The actors do their jobs well and director Brad Anderson has put together a thriller that sometimes thrills, when it's feeling gracious.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
Jon Hamm gives his best performance yet.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
There was so much more that could have been said in Beirut, but Jon Hamm is a strong enough actor to make the thriller work.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
Hamm's nuanced performance elevates the actor to stardom.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
Gilroy often fares better with more human elements to ground his often too-complex-by-half plotting, and here the solid cast makes the most of it.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
Imagine that Mad Men's Don Draper got out of the advertising business and went into the spy game.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
Feels like a throwback to old school political thrillers of the past and delivers little fresh or trendy by way of its story line.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
Beirut is a disappointing display of what filmmaking can accomplish in terms of offering artistic reflection into the world's affairs.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
But while the philosophy of Beirut is lacking, the film is generally entertaining.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
It's not edge-of-your-seat riveting, but it is interesting enough to get audiences to the end.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
Jon Hamm is like the Don Draper version of James Bond: sardonic, invested, talented but world weary and wryly humorous.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
Tony Gilroy's script is intricate and intelligent, with an appropriately cynical view of US foreign relations. And Hamm makes hay with his best role since Mad Men.
 "
Beirut,82,56,critic,"
[Beirut] is definitely a step up, with a stronger cast, led by Jon Hamm and Rosamund Pike, and a more polished screenplay.

This trilogy is the film equivalent of bad sex. Part 1 was awkward foreplay. Part 2 went through the motions with monotonous moves. And now, Part 3 reaches a clumsy climax that's so obviously fake that you just want it to end.

League of Exotique Dancers,83,,audience,"The women of League of Exotique Dancers provide vibrant and enthusiastic subjects. Although their burlesque days are behind them, they all look back fondly. Director Rama Rau has gathered an array of burlesque legends all with very different ideas of what burlesque is and how it operates as a feminist art form. Rau's subjects include every one from a sweet little old lady who refuses to walk around naked even when she's alone, to a working dominatrix. League of Exotique Dancers gives us a look at the vast arrays of people and personalities who found freedom and joy in the strip tease. It is a wonderful celebration of femininity and the female body being reclaimed by women as an active force."
League of Exotique Dancers,83,,critic,"
League of Exotique Dancers is an upbeat look back on burlesque's glory days, told through the eyes of one-time practitioners who still have all the right moves.
 "
League of Exotique Dancers,83,,critic,"
A film about burlesque can't be all feathers and fluff. It needs to examine all aspects of the art form to add nuance and humanity to the film's subjects.
 "
League of Exotique Dancers,83,,critic,"
The ways in which they reclaimed the feminine mystique and controlled the way they used their bodies serve for evergreen lessons for women on what it means to be proud of what you have and how you choose to use it.

Mosul,84,82,audience,"War is hell, and interesting to see a non-English speaking version of events that are very fresh. I also appreciated that no cowardly, civilian-shooting Daesh murderers were given any name, identity or distinguishing features. Great feature from the Producer."
Mosul,84,82,audience,This movie is fantastic. Start to finish. Never heard of it. Found it on Netflix. Stunningly solid from top to bottom. May be the best Iraqi war movie I have ever seen. Definitely the best filmed.
Mosul,84,82,audience,A nice change in perspective but still falls in to some tropes of the genre.
Mosul,84,82,audience,"A violent, sad film about one SWAT group in Mosul."
Mosul,84,82,audience,"A gripping story about real-life heroes fighting to get their country back from a truly evil and vile organization. This is a raw, and hard, look at the grey realities of warfare and the sacrifice made by those who ultimately saved their nation at great cost. Must see."
Mosul,84,82,audience,"Overall, I think Mosul is a solid, gripping middle eastern drama that satisfies throughout and sticks to its subject. The film has many great action set pieces as ISIS and the Iraqi SWAT team fighters go head to head which I am sure will delight audiences. The performance from Suhail Dubbach as the team's leader, Jasem, is very noticeable for me and its certainly the standout in the film. Despite being slow at times, Mosul is certainly a film I will be recommending others to watch for its action and that it's a really well-done biopic. 

Quote – ""Don't be afraid, you're not the enemy"" – Jasem

Rating – 3.5/5"
Mosul,84,82,audience,Spellbound watching this.   Really interesting movie with all Arabic actors made this very different and uplifting and sad at the same time

Mosul,84,82,audience,Fascinating terrifying beautiful incredible movie I loved it so much.
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
Even if you find yourself wanting more out of the experience, Mosul offers a humanising look at post-2003 Iraq, with a powerful Oscar-worthy performance from Iraqi actor Suhail Dabbach.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
An Iraq War movie that's actually about Iraqis.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
""Mosul"" isn't the kind of easy, sentimental TV viewing often provided during the holidays, but it is a potent reminder of the deadly struggles and sacrifices some people have endured to earn their freedom.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
Writer/director Matthew Michael Carnahan has crafted a spare and purposeful narrative in which character and incident are allowed to tell their own story without heavy-handed editorialising.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
Bessa has terrific presence as the newbie through whose eyes we enter this extreme situation.... Dabbach adds engaging personality touches to the hard-nosed Jasem... One partcular standout is Elgadi as a mercurial colonel in another militia.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
It's a shame that Mosul's storytelling can't match up to the action or the power of the real-life story, because then Netflix might have had another Russo Brothers hit.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
A different take on the conflict in Iraq. There are some great actions scenes that are a great combination of over the top while being grounded.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
While one could list the familiar clichés readily found in the various American-themed war films of this kind, the added viewpoint brings some inherent complexity.

Mosul,84,82,critic,"
Constant war violence in excellent movie about Iraq War.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
Despite the Arab actors and subtitled dialogue, it's still a crappy American action picture.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
Mosul commands attention because of its fresh perspective; the movie tells its story from the viewpoint of Iraqis whose lives have been shattered by war.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
Mosul, like most great war (and by extension, anti-war) movies of our times, uses the vérité style of filming to great effect.

This is one of the best movies of 2020.

Mosul,84,82,critic,"
For my money, the best action picture on Netflix right now.

First-time director Matthew Michael Carnahan establishes himself as a talent to keep an eye on with a solid feature debut in the form of Mosul.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
Mosul is a well-made action film with an important message and a lot of heart, a combination seen all too rarely these days.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
It might come across as inadequate American compensation for having invaded an entire country, but the new war film, produced by the Russo brothers, is more than that.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
A harrowing war film, directed with urgency, in a way that's always clearly rendered, and not dependent on shaky-cam techniques
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
Some of Carnahan's choices rely on certain Western stereotypes to underscore the awfulness of the Islamic State ... but what Mosul gets right more often is its prioritization of the Iraqi perspective, and the weight of all this violence.
 "
Mosul,84,82,critic,"
Balances admirable ambition (it's an American film, but the characters speak Arabic) with the cruder goosing strategies and red-meat dialogue of a revenge picture.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
Its desire to inscribe the astronaut experience with feminine traits is admirable, but underbaked, namely because Sarah remains uncritically beholden to a fantasy of maternal virtue even as she prepares to make history.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
Proxima is a thoughtful and engrossing drama featuring an open, honest and possibly revelatory performance by Green.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
Alice Winocour's Proxima is a poignant tribute to a mother's resilience.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
Green deftly captures the push-pull of motherhood and stressful professional demands as she anchors this luminous, unique film that's grounded in reality, but transcends its earthly themes for something otherworldly.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
This is a personal journey of carrying her weight in one place and her responsibility in the other with detachment looming.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
Unique in its genre, Proxima does something rather radical in contemplating the heavens.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
This is one of Winocour's most striking qualities as a storyteller: Her gaze is wide, but she has a gift for keeping order, and so nothing in Proxima goes unconsidered-not one person, not one detail.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
Brings a fundamental new humanity to the story of those who court great danger in order to advance human knowledge. Eva Green is immense. Writer-director Alice Winocour's compassion is achingly acute.

Proxima,83,,critic,"
An earthbound space tale about dealing with the astronaut training quarantine.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
The film does a remarkable job illustrating a difficult process.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
A curiously empty film, not helped by the subdued and bland visual world of the cold, clinical astronaut facilities.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
Green has never been better, and Winocour ... again proves herself as a gifted writer. She's also one to watch as a director.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
It's a muted film, a mature and intimate film that doesn't lean into histrionics, instead finds beauty in the bonds of a mother and a child...
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
It's an impeccably observed drama that's hugely involving.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
Proxima avoids feeling overly maudlin while presenting its characters' emotions in a way that feels totally natural, a drama with its feet on the ground and its eyes on the stars.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
The result is an immersive, often ponderous exploration of what it means to become, as Sarah puts it, ""a space person.""
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
...this is an intelligently crafted, interesting fictive angle on a profession that never fails to fascinate.
 "
Proxima,83,,critic,"
The director defines her characters so broadly that it is difficult to invest in what befalls them.

Proxima,83,,critic,"
Alice Winocour's inspiring drama orbits similar terrain as the overdone Hilary Swank Netflix series ""Away,"" but handles everything better.

Judy & Punch,77,59,audience,Enjoyed the grim fairy-tale like feel and was quality enough to watch as part of a subscription.  Would not necessarily rent.
Judy & Punch,77,59,audience,"What would have made one hell of a good 30 minute ""Tales from the Crypt"" episode gets stretched very thin in a 90 minute movie.  Case in point, the third and fourth acts of the film could both have been cut as they are just a series of pointless montages that do more to confuse the timeline then advance the plot.   The tone of horror and comedy never quit lands ...until the 5th act where it all comes together well.  The music is hideous, it seems most of it was just placeholders that were just left in.  The director also decide to set it in a fictional ""time"" more out of laziness then any plot reasons."
Judy & Punch,77,59,audience,"The tone of the movie is all wrong. Or, better said, the different tones are all right, but they cannot blend for the life of them. Shame. The good thing is that you need the whole movie to figure that out, so at least you will reach the end without too many complications."
Judy & Punch,77,59,audience,Pretty good but hard watch at times
Judy & Punch,77,59,audience,"The tone is all over the place, and the movie becomes an amateurish romp with no backbone. It is completely unmoored. There are at least four distinctly different tones, and put together they make an inane movie. Not one of these massive shifts works at all, and every one is a huge shark jump. The movie comes across as confusing and stupid. Even so, I got through it okay, not hating it, but close. I would not recommend it."
Judy & Punch,77,59,audience,A genre-bending period drama with fairly chewable renaissance and feminist implications that would keep you entertained.
Judy & Punch,77,59,audience,"Feminist Fairy Tale, plodding with a horrible pay off in the end. Backhand this movie."
Judy & Punch,77,59,audience,Amazing. Very enjoyable.
Judy & Punch,77,59,audience,"An excellent period piece, witch trial story with dark humor and a nice message. A welcome variant on the classically realistic, dramatic, sometimes painful-sometimes spooky witch trial stories of the past (The Crucible, The Witch, etc.). The bizarre, hyperbolized, stereotypical characters and their plot twists were captivating--reminiscent of Monty Python-esque historical humor. I was intrigued the whole time!"
Judy & Punch,77,59,audience,"I viewed ""Judy and Punch"" on Amazon Prime. Easily the best film I've seen since I can't remember when. The music, the cinematography, the cast, the story line.... everything about it was STUNNING!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie!"

Judy and Punch feels like it has one too many strings attached to grow into the enthralling and thought-provoking story that it needs to be.

Aside from the obvious female empowerment message in the story, Judy & Punch has very pointed social commentary about the dangers of mistreating others just because they're 'different' from the majority.

The narrative of male aggression and female empowerment provides a perfectly cynical commentary for current times.

An odd exercise in violence and domestic strife...not really sure why anyone would want to watch.

Well-crafted, magical fable with a compelling contemporary feminist message.
 "
Scales,86,,critic,"
The film is a great technical achievement, with stunning use of black & white photography that plays with the shadowy nature of the village and its shores, and the brightness of the day that feels cynical rather than promising.

It's an impressive if repetitive yarn that marks [Shahad] Ameen out as a filmmaker with a potent visual style as she sets sail through restless waters and offers hope through rebellion. She is definitely one to watch.

Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,audience,There's very little story here Don't expect any third act reveals or anything interesting about the character. The archive footage of historic events is interesting to watch.
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,audience,Marion Stokes was a complicated woman who in the last 30 years of her life taped at least one channel of television for 24 hours and usually many more than that.  She accumulated tens of thousands of hours of television that are now archived on the internet.  The story of how we got there is fascinating and the result was a satisfied hubby and wife date night documentary.  Credit to Matt Wolf on another outstanding film.  Hubby: 8.0/Wife: 7.0 Average: 7.5/10
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
It is, of course, of immense archival value, but the effect of the sheer weight of such a vast store of media, layered upon itself like an enormous cake of pure information, is far more metaphysical than mere archival utility.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
Stokes is a fascinating, elusive protagonist - she was a recluse who enjoyed daily martinis and felt a kinship with Steve Jobs. Yet Wolf treats her archive with reverence, rather than writing her off as an eccentric.

This documentary shows Stokes to have the fanatical energy of a hoarder, the zeal of an evangelist and the intensity of a visionary.

Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
The documentary is at its best when it contrasts how Stokes's recording was received at the time versus how the value of her work has appreciated.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
Recorder could have easily withstood the inclusion of an additional 25 minutes of material, if only to make these two disparate half-movies into a more complete profile of an under-appreciated mind.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
""Recorder"" shows the link between Stokes' brilliance and her craziness, and the damaging effects of obsessive behavior to the quality of a life lived. She was documenting the story, but ""Recorder"" shows how, in a way, she became the story.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
Stokes remains something of an enigma, but watching Recorder, one thing becomes clear: We can learn a lot from the ability to rewind.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
Clips from Stokes' collection are seen throughout, turning this weird but rewarding movie into a kind of review of 30 years of history.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
While the documentary doesn't live up to its promise, Marion's 35 years of work appears to have found the right home and will reward researchers, and curious members of the public, for years to come.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
Press play and be amazed.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
In Recorder, Wolf paints a compelling portrait of a woman whose unambiguous hoarding tendencies made it difficult to identify her enormously valuable media archival project as anything beyond yet another obsession
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
The Marion Stokes Project captures both the inherent humor and the utter absurdity of what this single-minded woman devoted her life to. Buried within all those hours of footage are gems and relics to capture a time and place in an unprecedented fashion.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
Its main focus, as established by director Matt Wolf, is to paint this one eccentric, often prickly woman as a keeper of the flame of truth.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
The camera doesn't love Stokes, but it certainly respects her. The intensity of her presence is unmistakable. That intensity is attested to, not always favorably, by the various people we hear from in ""Recorder.""
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
This is a really fascinating documentary... The movie gets into these definitions of what is the difference between calling someone a hoarder or a collector?
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
But more than its occasional resemblance to a very special episode of ""Hoarders,"" Wolf's strange, sad and finally exhilarating portrait is one of radical consumerism turned into a searchable legacy - the viewer as activist.
 "
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project,95,50,critic,"
What makes Recorder so utterly compelling and beautifully textured is the absolute compassion and sympathy that director Matt Wolf has for his subject

The Antenna,55,,critic,"
Orçun Behram's moody and eerie thriller is a stylistic winner, but is the atmosphere worthy of its narrative?
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
slowly evolves into a legitimately creepy tale about media consumption, conformity, and the generally selfish nature of mankind
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
The visual flourishes can't compensate for an unfocused, lumbering screenplay in which the logical gaps overwhelm the muddled sociopolitical subtext.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
A striking directorial style adds interest to this pitch-black Turkish satire, as filmmaker Orcun Behram mixes political themes with expanding dystopian horror.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
We must consider where the message is coming from and what it conveys in The Antenna. What Behram says is important and outshines the length of the film or any nitpicking.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
The Antenna is a spellbinding horror film that scarily communicates the dread behind controlled media and why we should fear it.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
Berham is more concerned with spooky and galvanizing effects than with coherent statements or satire.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
The film looks fine enough, the performances sufficiently bleak, and the score is quite emotive, but it asks a lot of the audience's attention and then never rewards them.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
The Antenna is an eerie dystopian horror that reflects Turkey's descent over the past decade or more into a state of mass surveillance.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
More allegorical than interesting.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
It's a collage of obtuse authoritarian and technological symbolism, presented like a trip through Silent Hill without any of the self-reflective pathos.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
A tedious downward spiral into the empty heart of nothing in particular.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
Orçun Behram's Turkish horror film, The Antenna, doesn't live up to its promising logline.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
The Antenna fails to conduct enough of the much-needed spark to switch up the film's rather bland blend of B-movie shocks and half-charged satire. In the end, The Antenna just gets its wires crossed.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
a dystopian parable exposing the hidden pipes and wires that feed the propaganda machine of an oppressive regime.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
It is Behram's eye, Engin Ozkaya's gothic photography, Ufuk Bildibay's surreal production design, Can Demirci's schizophrenic score and the angsty sound design that makes this atmospheric horror so fresh and inventive.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
An ambitious and imaginative sci-fi thriller.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
The Antenna is way too simple to warrant the time and attention it begs of its audience.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
A handsomely designed but perishable dystopian horror-thriller that impresses through imagery and audio cues... but doesn't scar the soul like it should.
 "
The Antenna,55,,critic,"
The Antenna functions as an odd parable, one which may be a bit too late.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,audience,"Beautiful and atmospheric picture which masterfully balances between the realistic horror and ironic touches. Cage's performance is just brilliant, though he never fails to do this kind of roles lately.
Can't wait to see the rest of the trilogy if it sees the light."
Color Out of Space,86,82,audience,"Absolutely love this move. As a long time lovecraft fan who has read 90 percent of the material created by the providence Master of Cosmic Horror, this is one of my favourite lovecraftian movies. It respects the spirit of the original tale while taking some creative licences on characters and elements. It´s a slow tale as it was in the original but the last quarter gets weirder and weirder until it reaches the top of the horror as it should, with the madness that can only come from the realization of what Horrors lie in the spaces in between our Knowledge and the Truth. Can´t wait to see the next movie from this trilogy. And with this start the Dunwich Horror will be at least this good. Can´t but recommend it to any Cosmic Horror fans and of course to any Lovecraftian Cultists as well :D"
Color Out of Space,86,82,audience,"It was seriously good and creepy with a couple of ""oh sh**"" parts....you never fully understand but you really don't need to."
Color Out of Space,86,82,audience,Color Out of Space is an intensely creepy and terrifying Lovecraft adaption that comes equipped with good acting and phenomenal effects
Color Out of Space,86,82,audience,"I read the short story by H. P. Lovecraft before watching the movie; the ""color"" seemed more magical in my imagination, and the events of the story more horrific. Reading the piece gave this creepy feeling of the color slowly spreading, — like it had no intention of doing any harm. In fact I think the ""color"" just wanted to spread in all its splendor, and it just happens that it had a harmful effect on living things wherever it went. This quality of innocence (like a virus that has the good intention to only spread) made it all the more horrific. Whereas the movie made the ""color"" seem like a monster that you could face and hate, and eliminate.
Mostly I enjoyed seeing how a movie could be made out of a short story like that."
Color Out of Space,86,82,audience,"This movie is a pretty good watch, fun and entertaining "
Color Out of Space,86,82,audience,"lousy film, it seems that they tried to mix science fiction with the supernatural and in the end there was neither one nor the other, special effects that seem done in the 80s but not in a good way, an example of a great waste of time ..."
Color Out of Space,86,82,audience,Slow paced and didn't go anywhere. Not okay.
Color Out of Space,86,82,audience,One of the worst films iv ever watched.
Color Out of Space,86,82,audience,16.01.2021 ---------
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
A parody of self-actualization in which an isolated family undergoes grotesque cosmic metamorphosis after being irradiated by a prismatic meteorite.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
Even Nicolas Cage, compelling as he is, is interesting in spite of the underwritten script not because of it.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
The hardest thing to wrap your head around is how beautiful it all is, even the gross bits, and just how much that alone can carry you through.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
I found the results authentically nightmarish, perhaps especially thanks to the film's unusual rhythm for horror: not a panicky staccato but a fuzzy-edged, narcotic throb.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
Stanley and his crew masterfully use practical effects and brief glimpses at the terrors to toy with audiences' imaginations and send them into unsettling territory.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
A trippy and grotesque vision of the real and unreal colliding in the New England wilderness, energized by memorably out-there effects and its reliably rage-y leading man.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
Color Out of Space is a little uneven, cramming too many ideas into the mix, but the mix of two gonzo artists like Cage and Stanley offers up an movie that amps up the cinematic anxiety in unpredictable ways.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
COLOR OUT OF SPACE holds nothing back. Stanley enthusiastically dives into his source material to create a dazzling technicolor nightmare, complete with deranged alpacas.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
Psychedelic, cosmic dread with a dash of gnarly body horror, Stanley's first feature in decades is a gonzo rollercoaster bolstered by off-the-walls performances and hypnotic cinematography.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
Though we are still far from having a definitive cinematic version of The Color Out Of Space, Stanley's film has a lot going for it and will certainly interest fans.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
In the end though, there's just not enough bat shit Nicolas Cage moments to make this one worth your while.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
If you're a Nicholas Cage fan, and you have a friend thats a Nicholas Cage fan, this is a perfect film to go see together... It is a wild trip.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
For the more adventurous viewers, Colour Out of Space is a visually spectacular, insanely exhilarating, and unfathomable piece of work that could only have come from the minds of Lovecraft and Stanley. Highly recommended.
 "
Color Out of Space,86,82,critic,"
Depending on your mood, Color Out of Space will either be an entertaining yet manic escapade of fun or a disappointing adaptation of Lovecraft's source material.

Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,audience,"Doesn't often happen that a movie makes such a bad impression that I feel criticism is warranted. In this case, the disappointment I felt left me little choice. Where the first movie was a nice bit of over-the-top silliness, this sequel is an unstructured collection of Disneyfied memes and flat-falling pop cult references that takes itself way too seriously. How could you go wrong with a movie that has Lizard Overlord Hitler riding a T-Rex into a Nazi Moonbase, you ask? Well, watch this, and find out."
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,audience,Wanted to like it more. Not as good as the first one. 
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,audience,"Funny
It was because of them that the calamity of humankind"
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,audience,Some fun moments but overall extremely bad.
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,audience,Seriously the lead actress was just overly self absorbed. I couldn't get pass the first 20 minutes. Who ever wrote this trash needs to retire. I think that feminist need to just have their own network and focus on doing them. I mean they seriously don't get that nobody not even women are feeling this overly macho alpha female crap. If you claim it doesn't look good on guys why mimic it? A blatent contradiction.
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,audience,"The perfect movie vehicle for the likes of Tom Green.
Check out the band Laibach who provided music for the film."
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,audience,This was genuine stupid genius. I have not had so much film with a campy movie in an age and Malcolm is possibly now my spirit animal.
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,audience,"Malcolm pulls the plot along, he is amazing. He reminds me of Kronk from Emporer's New Groove. Essential.

Watch with friends and have a laugh. Top 10 movies to giggle at and cheer for the after-credits ending. 10/10 would recommend."
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,audience,"Its great, its cheesy, and it doesn't take itself seriously. Watch it and be open minded it's a funny nonsensical watch."
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,audience,nice effects and interesting characters but the story is meh
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,critic,"
The Coming Race doesn't have the love and affection of its predecessor, nor does it have a sense of discipline or focus, and unfortunately falls flat.
 "
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,critic,"
As much as this premise could make for a good time, it's largely a bore and a mess.
 "
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,critic,"
Call it mindless schlock if that makes you feel better about liking it, but campy movies are supposed to be ridiculous and entertaining. Iron Sky: The Coming Race is light years from the latter.
 "
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,critic,"
Just like the first ""Iron Sky,"" the sequel is frustratingly unfocused as a commentary on the modern world - and even more so as a story.
 "
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,critic,"
Noisy and unfunny, still pawing at the same obvious political targets while expanding its capacity for mayhem, hoping to wow viewers instead of tickle them with relentless absurdity.
 "
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,critic,"
The Coming Race might not sell the need for this absurd series to continue, it at least provides a reason to go back and watch the original, and help its creators get the money they need to try to recapture their uniquely bizarre form of movie magic.
 "
Iron Sky: The Coming Race,29,32,critic,"
... there's something so refreshing, so pure, about the Iron Sky series in what it attempts, that audiences can't help but get swept up in its wake.

I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,audience,"Outstanding.  Brilliantly directed and acted.  Its theme is the prevalence of historical amnesia in societies that want to forget their brutalization and extermination of racial and ethnic minorities.  That's what makes this Romanian production relevant for Americans, so many of whom prefer not to think about how slavery and genocide were instrumental, indeed essential, in building our country.  It does help to have a knowledge of Holocaust history, and even more so if you already know about Romania's role in that event, which I do.  And you have to have the patience to listen to the thought-provoking dialogues in the film.  So if you can find that hard-to-get DVD, by all means do so."
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,audience,"One of the worst films I've seen. Awful acting, pretentious and senseless dialogues. Long useless shots of penis and hanged people. Why?"
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,audience,"Я никак не мог пропустить кино о Холокосте в Одессе, который забрал моих прадедушек и прабабушек.

Но это кино не переносится ни в Одессу, и не в то время. Это наше время и это место где евреев почти не осталось. И несмотря на это, оно расскрывает Холокост так, как я никогда не видел. Потому что это не трагедия прошлого.

A brilliantly conceived film.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
What gives it nearly all its bite is the big questions it asks about history, and representing history through art.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
It is a layered, masterful work that proves that artistic mediums carry tremendous weight, and that what audiences bring to them will determine exactly how much they will take away.

I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians doesn't plays games. It is exactly what it is: an indictment of Romania's past...
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
The movie's refusal to dumb down its ideas, truncate its arguments or skimp on the power of its own verbiage is precisely what makes it so mesmerizing.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
Radu Jude has turned Antonescu's words against him, using the authoritarian's callous proclamation as the title of his latest movie. The effect is so damning that if Antonescu lived today, he may find that he cares after all.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
Director Radu Jude presents a simultaneously playful and intense meditation on the ways in which recreating the past can obscure history's meaning as one gets caught up in the making of illusion.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
Just the latest example of how Romanian cinema is on the cusp of the leading edge politically and artistically, as much as the French new wave of the 1960s.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
Like other contemporary Romanian filmmakers, Jude is well attuned to human absurdities, especially those of pompous public officials.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
Jude's reproduction of the on-set vibe-presented almost as a pseudo-documentary-produces genuine narrative dynamism (think Day for Night or A Cock and Bull Story).
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
Until its devastating final scenes, the way ""I Do Not Care"" makes its points is discursive rather than dramatic.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
Barbarians makes the nightmare of Communist oppression, and its continuing effect on the popular and artistic psyche, absolutely clear -- and pertinent.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
Barbarians is, in other words, anything but subtle.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
Radu Jude's film is a bitterly comic essay on nationalist mythologies and historical amnesia.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
Barbarians may be one of the more intellectually daunting movies at SIFF this year, with its single-take scenes, philosophical references, and meta approach. But it is, unfortunately, relevant and necessary viewing
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
A potent argument for truth in art, and a provocative challenge for all nations to reckon honestly with their own history.
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
An experimental dive headfirst into controversy, it leaves you wondering: what would happen if more films embraced the complexity of their subject like this?
 "
I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians,96,57,critic,"
[The film] makes clear that you can have all the right answers, but they hardly matter when you're missing the questions and in fact aren't even having the same conversation.

Ode to Joy,45,63,audience,"I am someone who actually has narcolepsy with cataplexy,and I didn't make it pass the wedding scene to be totally disappointed! The hardest thing about narcolepsy with cataplexy is feeling alone and misunderstood,these Hollywood movies making jokes out of narcolepsy,and not getting it right,is why we will continue to be misunderstood and taken as a joke!"
Ode to Joy,45,63,audience,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

The concept of living a life without ""joy"" is intriguing, but it doesn't feel like a very cinematic story as a concept.  The movie takes great pains to try to compensate for this.  I believe the casting definitely helped here.

And sure I understand guys fainting at the thought of being with Morena Baccin, but I'm not about to kick Melissa Rauch out of bed either.  Both ladies brought their abilities to the roles excellently.

While the movie is fun, the motives are rather crossed and you're forced to try to think a bit more than you normally would as the story lends towards you thinking like he thinks to understand a bit better.

Overall a great little love story though."
Ode to Joy,45,63,audience,Pleasantly funny romantic flick with  lovable characters. And Martin Freeman! What's not to like?
Ode to Joy,45,63,audience,"This was a funny movie about quirky, lovable people.  I didn't know anything about it except for the name of the lead actor so I was delighted to find myself laughing out loud quite a bit."
Ode to Joy,45,63,audience,I was thoroughly charmed! It's a sweet sad romantic comedy set in Brooklyn with cool music too! Super funny!

Ode to Joy,45,63,audience,Martin Freeman is brilliant in the film
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
Cataplexy, in turn, is more of a plot gimmick - a sad case of missed opportunity. Even the laughs are few and far between.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
Ode to Joy doesn't really work as either an efficient comedy or drama (or even a bit of both), with the familiar beats and tropes lacking in any real thought.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
The romantic aspects also fail to move you, and as for the comedy, it is the supporting cast (Rauch and Lacy) who make you laugh.
 "

A charming, character driven rom-com.

Ode to Joy is one strange little motion picture.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
Inspired by a true story - yes, cataplexy is very real - from events in co-writer Chris Higgins' life, ""Ode to Joy"" is held together by an amazing performance by Freeman.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
I found the real joy of Ode to Joy in its cast.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
Freeman and Baccarin have little chemistry, even when their characters are trying to generate some, and Lacy is too convincing at being a shallow jerk to make his role any fun.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
This movie is so charming, smart, and funny... This movie full of quirky people ultimately got me.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
Instead of being a song to lift the heart, Ode to Joy is a discordant, off-key tune that lasts too long.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
A comedy that encourages viewers to reflect on what makes them happy.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
Adorable and very funny.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
I was about to describe Ode to Joy as being ""the most insufferable romantic comedy to come along since... "" but had to stop when I realized that I could not immediately think of one quite as painful and off-putting.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
... mostly avoids exploiting its affliction for cheap laughs, although denying the audience the same emotional triggers as Charlie is unintentional. In other words, it's not funny or touching enough to give us joy.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
What makes this movie work are the interactions between the quartet of main cast members. Morena Baccarin, Martin Freeman, Jake Lacy, and Melissa Rauch are all a ton of fun.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
A plainly affable romantic comedy that's not too powerful with its romance, and certainly not its comedy.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
Humorless to a paralyzing extent, this joyless effort illustrates how a bad-on-paper idea can turn into something cringe-inducing onscreen.
 "
Ode to Joy,45,63,critic,"
The movie makes its inherently sympathetic lead character into a rather unlikeable jerk.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,audience,"I'm a big Melissa McCarthy fan so almost anything with her will get me into the theater, and this had a couple of other good additions as well in Elisabeth Moss and Tiffany Haddish. Based on a comic book series, this story tells that of these 3 women who take over their husbands mob business while they serve a jail sentence. The story could have been better early on to flesh out the characters. Pretty early on in the film their husbands are sent away and they take over. However, my main issue with the film was believability. I wasn't buying that these women, in 1978 in Hell's Kitchen New York could muscle out the other men who were looking to take over for their husbands while they were gone. Short of walking tall with a confident look on their face, the story was clunky and Elisabeth Moss was really the only character to have an interesting character arc out of the 3."
The Kitchen,24,69,audience,"Una volta passata la novità iniziale, con l'ingresso nel mondo del crimine delle 3 protagoniste, il film si perde in un susseguirsi di gestione ordinaria degli eventi, che ogni tanto vengono intramezzati da qualche scossone.
Forse il problema principale sta nella mancanza di simpatia che si prova, almeno a tratti, verso le tre donne.
E il finale non offre assolutamente nulla di interessante."
The Kitchen,24,69,audience,"Saw this one on a Delta flight.  I would not recommend.  Are we supposed to feel sad for the pridictament these girls are in because their crimal husbands went to jail, and they have no other skills to make ends meet except picking up where their (mostly rotten) husbands left off ?!?  What a weird concept.  And I'm supposed to feel good about ladies who run a protection racket (or men for that matter) taking money from honest business owners in the neighborhood?  Besides turning into bloodthirsty mobsteresses (?) the morale decline of these women is pretty fast.  Also there is a lot of killing.  I was expecting a little more off-beat laughter, or story, or something.  They just go around killing all their comeptition, and then some of their people get killed too, and then their husbands come back and they all get killed, and then the two ladies want to kill each other after the theird one gets killed, oh, and the third ones boyfriend gets killed.  See where I'm going here?  There is a lot of killing.  And of course the unapproving Dad who goes on all the time about raising her (Melissa McCarty) right, suddenly has a change of heart when her kids get kidnapped and says, go ahead we now approve of you being a mobster, and doing a lot of killing.  This film reeks of having an underlying women's power message, but does not perform.  Don't get me wrong, I love tough women messages in movies, like Peppermint, or Joy, or Girl With the Dragon Tatoo.  Empowered women fighting against the system are great.  These gals, sadly, are not."
The Kitchen,24,69,audience,I didn't find either the story or characters convincing. What made it worse was the Mrs passed out with the remote in her hand in the first 10 minutes...
The Kitchen,24,69,audience,"I can tell The Kitchen is really trying. It has strong performances, well-realised production design, a good, natural arc for Elisabeth Moss's character and some pretty good shots (double-entendre not intended). But the occasionally haphazard pacing, poorly thought-out reasons as to why we should be rooting for these gnagsters' wives and convoluted plot end causing this crime drama to become an uninspired comic book movie, that might even affect Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish's future attempts to play against type."
The Kitchen,24,69,audience,"This ‘70s story of the wives of New York gangsters who continue to operate their jailed husbands' Hells Kitchen rackets, has potential, but without the opportunity to really connect to any characters is it difficult for the audience to be really engaged. There are some twists and turns in the plot and Melissa McCarthy, Tiffany Haddish and Elisabeth Moss do decent jobs in their roles as the wives, however, ultimately it is the period setting and costumes that shine brightest."
The Kitchen,24,69,audience,"Kept my attention and was well written. Elizabeth Moss and Melissa McCarthy shined! Tiffany Haddish wasn't best suited for this role. Maybe another choice would have helped the cast and the movie. Haddish over acted to portray a tough character. It just wasn't believable and by the end of the movie, a bit annoying. Otherwise, the movie was great!"

The Kitchen,24,69,audience,"As a VERY big champion of female filmmakers, I wanted to love this but it's just bad. McCarthy holds her own but that's the only pro. Moss was in a completely different movie than the entire cast. Her performance unjustified, nonsensical and erratic, at best. The film was choppy. The characters are one-dimensional. The worst part is subtly is dead in this film, in a very bad way. The writer never heard the phrase ""show, don't tell"". Women don't want a film where the women lecture men about how strong they are. They want REAL women living their lives in their strength. This movie felt like an after school special with violence. McCarthy & Haddish deserve better."
The Kitchen,24,69,audience,"Yes it has some....okay maybe a bunch of flaws, but it has plenty of Entertainment and it a fun ride. I get the impression that the ones who dis like it are the artsy nitpickers."
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
The Kitchen should have been a showcase for both its stars and writer/director. Instead, it's a dumpster fire of a movie that makes little sense and is a black mark on the reputations of its many well-known actors.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
Nothing quite adds up, character or story wise, and what might have been an interesting and timely look at dismantling of patriarchal structures it instead finds its female empowerment within violence.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
The drama, storytelling, and performances are top-notch.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
It's at its most interesting when seasoned screenwriter Andrea Berloff, making her directorial debut here, allows her movie to become genuinely nasty.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
Sometimes you can have all the ingredients but too many cooks in the kitchen. That's the case in the new crime drama ""The Kitchen,"" which features a killer cast and stylish period details, but suffers from an uneven plot that feels slapped together.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
The film is not great. It's too long, it's heavily laden with crime and relies heavily on firepower. The story feels choppy, with no sense of direction.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
In a different film the tension between the demands of the gangster genre and the female empowerment genre would be electric. Here it just means a lot of stock standard gangster movie scenes delivered with a modicum of competence
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
Dramatic moments can and do work within dark comedies, and vice-versa - but by being both at once, The Kitchen ends up giving its audience cinematic whiplash.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
The characters are all one-dimensional, the attempts at catharsis feel canned.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
The Kitchen knows how to communicate the general outline of the story's emotional beats, but it has absolutely no idea how to make any of them land.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
There is a great movie buried somewhere in here.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
The Kitchen is a good late summer crime movie and a different type of comic book movie (that most won't think is one).
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
The Kitchen is a half-cooked crime drama that never quite rises to the occasion.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
If you are a fan of the cast or the genre, it is absolutely worth checking out; it is a solid three-star movie.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
This story about three mob wives taking the reins after their husbands are imprisoned is uneven, at best.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
The Kitchen is a moderately competent crime flick and that's all it is. Given the cast, it could've been much sharper.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
This is a degrading movie for everyone involved with it. So badly written and executed it almost feels offensive for the culture it portrays. [Full review in Spanish}.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
I understand the appeal for McCarthy, Haddish, and Moss to take on a film like this, but The Kitchen wastes all of their talents.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
The ultra-lean screenplay has no chitchat, no color, no personality. But the actors have plenty of charisma and magnetism of their own, which makes the movie passable grown-up entertainment.
 "
The Kitchen,24,69,critic,"
McCarthy, Haddish and Moss deliver great performances in a forgettable film.
 "
Knowing,34,42,audience,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. This movie adds something fresh and inspiring to the disaster genre.

Certainly the action scenes are well staged, they are grand and tense. Movie had a lot of surprising, riveting turns due to which audience is bound to know what will happen next.

At first, I thought it was ""save the world"" type but by the end we get to know that it is not.

I had a complain regarding the film. The middle portion of the movie was slow and stretched. Still, I think the captivating final third more than makes up for it. Ending should not be spoiled because it changes everything."
Knowing,34,42,audience,"Total bullshit.  Poor plot, shit fires just lame"
Knowing,34,42,audience,"Extremely underrated. Absolutely love this end-of-days new-noir conspiracy film that was pulled out of a time capsule, from a disturbed little girl who put it into the ground 50 years earlier! I love following the investigation how Cage is the only to see the dots connecting, and the of course proving the naysayers all wrong (woohoo). Love Knowing "
Knowing,34,42,audience,2 hours of my life I will never get back.
Knowing,34,42,audience,"""Knowing"" is a great example of how to make a good film into something really stupid. The entire film is based on theories and ideas with a plot being very well written up until the time when nearly everything is a coincidence and adding of some sort of a fantasy part. I know adding whispers is something that could be considered sci-fi, but there is no explanation to why kids react to them like that or especially some of the qualities they are able to do. There is in fact very little a viewer knows about them, but at this case it works very poorly. Ending feels banal and that is one of the main reasons I'm giving this film such a low rating. Nicholas Cage plays perfectly the entire film and makes you believe in his madness, the emotions in the movie are clearly felt. But, besides that, some of the scenes are very poor, as of how terrible the CGI is. The movie was made in 2009, when ""Iron Man"" was already a year into cinematic industry, so seeing such unrealistic computer ""Game of 2004 3D"" style CGI is just uncomfortable to watch at, as it brings you out of the events. The ending is not just bad, but illogical, as it leaves you with a feeling of nothing. There is not a single thing in existence that would have actually made characters come to such decision, as well as besides all coincidences being something explainable in the movie, it feels like all those coincidences are very rushed and are out of place at some point. A good sci-fi movie with an actual potential got wasted, which I didn't expect seeing while choosing the film, a 6/10, has some great concepts but disappoints a lot in the end."
Knowing,34,42,audience,"Este é um filme relativamente bom, que eu assistiria várias vezes.
Com cenas muito bem executadas."
Knowing,34,42,audience,It's just another beginning.
Knowing,34,42,audience,"Guilty pleasure or not, I like Knowing quite a bit despite all the bad reviews. The second act was typical in its disaster tropes and the movie can be quite silly in its SF elements, but there is no denying the powerful parts that are the intrigue of the first act and the unexpected darkness of its batshit insane ending. It's a highly entertaining, mystical and very suspenseful SF disaster flick that works more often than not."
Knowing,34,42,audience,"It's a two hour sermon from the church of the end times, telling all of us non-believers that we're gonna burn (and soon).  The acting is okay (if very morose) so it gets a star, and the premise is interesting up until the deus ex machina, but boy do they lay it on thick.  Are you one of God's chosen?  If not then I'd suggest avoiding this drivel."
Knowing,34,42,audience,A highly underrated sci fi film with strong special effects and an in form Nicholas Cage. The ending is memorable and thought provoking. I never understood the dislike for this movie and to this day my opinion stays the same. Definitely worth a watch or two
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
The plot is hinged around a predicament so overwhelming that its conclusion can't possibly resolve satisfactorily.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
Nicolas Cage being Nicolas Cage in a film that requires Cage to be Cage.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
Part science fiction cliché, part religious crackpotism, [the ending's] genuinely bad enough to cast a shadow over the entire film.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
Unbreakable quickly descends into bad CGI set-ups and portentous, hysterical exchanges.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
... I was dozing off...
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
The impressively grim finale ensures that Knowing ultimately ends on a decidedly memorable note...
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
A damned entertaining movie despite the fact that it stars Nicholas Cage.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
A shotgun spray of metaphysics, cosmology, the Old Testament, flying saucers, angels, spooky blonde-haired men in black trench coats, mysterious little black rocks, two cute kids and a moose on fire.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
Suffice it to say that the last third is a mélange of Close Encounters and Christian eschatology, and you'll wish the film had stopped about 15 minutes sooner.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
If those space-dudes are so friendly, why drive children insane with a bunch of weird code? Why not just show up on The Tonight Show and tell everybody the exact date and time? Lame! Also: Why fake Massachusetts? Why not just say: 'This is Australia.'
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
Knowing is about faith; the belief that one day the mysteries of the universe will be explained to us, and the knowledge that anything is possible.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
It's a folly and a failure, but an intriguing one - an ambitious vision from a tremendous filmmaker that, sadly, had too much going on with not enough to say.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
Alex Proyas has gone all out on a film which, unfortunately, will be seen by many as an interesting experiment gone awry, rather than the sci-fi masterpiece it aspires to be.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
A slog through lazy writing, indifferent acting and blase direction with no hope of anything but chaotic violence as reward.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
A broad, leisurely jumble of Alfred Hitchcock-style suspense architecture and a dreary, paint-by-numbers Sci-Fi Channel Original, Knowing only seems to extract two reactions: nail-biting and eye-rolling.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
... starts off as director Alex Proyas's take on ""Final Destination"" before going all ""Close Encounters"" on us. If only we hadn't seen it all before.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
Basically two movies wrestling around in a burlap bag full of rocks: one an ambitious, big-idea sci-fi yarn, the other a horror movie as dumb as ... well, that's where those rocks come in.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
Pay attention to Mr. Proyas' lighting and set design as well as the intense disaster sequences that dot Knowing: As with the rest of his oeuvre, the movie looks great.
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
This year's prize for most ludicrous set-up and most ludicrous punchline
 "
Knowing,34,42,critic,"
Knowing feels like a bunch of cool ideas that were strewn about a table, picked up, shoved together, tied up with duct tape and, somehow, managed to stay working for the ride.

RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,audience,Overly dramatic. Makes it hard to agree (even though I kind of do) with the author when they are that dramatic and when they present such an unlovable character in such an unlovable way as they did Girl Talk.
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,audience,"A documentary about an incredibly important subject that highlights many of the key points that need to be made about the subject, but that unfortunately disregards any and all nuances present in the issue, instead relying on poor rhetoric based on a black-and-white worldview, which is a shame considering the point it's trying to make is actually an important one."
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,audience,"Expertly edited and directed, plus being overall well made, Brett Gaylor's RIP!: A Remix Manifesto is truly a supremely fascinating documentary whose ideas are expressed honestly and will surely connect with many younger people in this day and age of copyright regulations, even if it's already somewhat dated in aspects."
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,audience,"Powerful and based on strong arguments, it's a punch against abuse of copyright laws, but more focus could have strengthened the message."
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,audience,Easily my favorite movie
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,audience,an interesting debate about who owns culture
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,audience,What a great subject to do a documentary on.
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,audience,"It seems forceful and very one-sided, but there is some informative quality to the film's arguments, even if it isn't organized as effectively as it should be."
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,audience,"This documentary isnt so much about remixes and remix culture as it is internet piracy, intellectual piracy and copyright laws. Everything but the kitchen sink is thrown in, including Culture jamming, Disney, Napster, Metallica, and Brazil trying to mass market generic HIV drugs. Besides Girl Talk, you'd think there would be a lot more music in the movie, but their isnt..hip hop and dance music pioneering in sampling are glaringly ignored. Dada, Futurism and Pop Art get only a brief mention."
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,audience,"A great film on the topic of copyright and remixing. The only negative thing about this film is director/narrator Brett Gaylor's omission of the fact that Negativland actively sought to confuse consumers by releasing their U2/Casey Kasem mashup album with ""U2"" splashed across the cover in big bold letters. I support their right to invent new art by combining existing source material, but not their shameless marketing tactics."
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
Rip is a dazzling frontal assault on how corporate culture is using copyright law to muzzle freedom of expression.
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
The film is so wadded full with ideas that they come squishing out the sides.
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
A healthy punk attitude informs this documentary.
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
Gaylor shows us a glimpse of what a creatively free world can look like on the artistic scale, via artists like Girl Talk, and on a broader, societal scale via a look at Brazil, which has become a world leader in copyright progressivism.
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
issues are complex and the approaches to the solution are even more so. This film makes it hard to agree with either side.
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
There are better guides to the subject than Gaylor, who discusses everything from Napster to pharmaceutical patents without ever varying his dated we-the-people rhetoric.
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
There is a feeling, as the film goes on, that a more subtle, sophisticated debate is being sacrificed in the interests of a video clip.
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
As a piece of polemic, it's a well worked doco, using energy, narration and home video style footage to ram home the message. Pity the message is flawed
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
This documentary by Canadian-born filmmaker Brett Gaylor, who was born at the same time as the internet was conceived, fails to present a rational debate
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
A forceful, vibrant and immensely entertaining call to action.
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
A movie that manages to cut through the tangled history of intellectual property clearly and colourfully.
 "
RiP! A Remix Manifesto,42,74,critic,"
A half-baked, poorly argued assault on the very notion of the sanctity of intellectual property posing as cutting-edge cinema.

Fired Up,24,52,audience,One of my favorite movies. Eric Christian Olsen is comedy gold. I have watched this over 100 times
Fired Up,24,52,audience,"There's a couple moments to chuckle at, but it's pretty disheartening to realize just how easy I was to please with comedy at a younger age. I used to think this was alright, but nah. It's just juvenile, crass and mediocre."
Fired Up,24,52,audience,"Funny every time I watch it, and I've rewatched it a lot.  That something I rarely do with movies. A feel good movie that isn't uptight and preachy. Just lots of fun.  And a pretty smart parody/ takedown of cheerleading movies in general, which I think should be acknowledged.  Funny."
Fired Up,24,52,audience,This movie is hilarious! What's that spell??? F....U!!! Prohibidibabado!!!! 10 and a half in Crocks! Lol
Fired Up,24,52,audience,One of my favotite bad movies
Fired Up,24,52,audience,"Extremely funny and clever humor. Silly plays on words that might go over your head the first time watching it, but after the second time you will really appreciate all the sly and underhanded jokes that can be found everywhere in this movie. Very well casted and has a playful tone, with a slight message of teen love and feelings."
Fired Up,24,52,audience,Worst movie I've ever watched :( or started to watch but turned of half way because it was terrible.
Fired Up,24,52,audience,"If this is a satire then it is an incredibly clever, funny movie. It intentionally soaks itself in stereotypes and breaks the third wall as the characters question the numerous clichés that the movie revels in. Dedicated cast, likeable characters, and great soundtrack. But judging by the horrible reviews, I'm getting the impression that this movie wasn't intentionally a satire. If you watch it from the perspective of ""this movie satirizes the stereotypes and clichés in teen movies,"" then you will really enjoy this."
Fired Up,24,52,audience,one of my all time favourites
Fired Up,24,52,audience,"Good movie. It's clichéd, formulaic, misogynistic and cheesy, but it's still a lot of fun thanks to some quick-witted humor and great performances from its leads, D'Agosto and Olsen."
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
Boasts a remarkable amount of clever and inventive sexual metaphors, and a few eccentric characters that mask the lackluster, stereotypical illustrations.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
It's hard to figure out, then, what went wrong.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
A markedly generic teen sex comedy.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
All spunk and no spark make for a mediocre movie.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
Seriously, an R-rating and this would have been a totally different, way better movie.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
It sounds like that the kind of thing that would have been right at home with the teen comedies of twenty years ago, or even the brief American Pie-ish revival. But compared to current stuff it's actually kind of quaint.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
This is not made for anyone with more than a sprinkling of intelligence.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
A charmless, witless, lumbering mess. Almost nothing could redeem this lame comedy.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
Fired Up is big on stereotypes (hello, gay Indian guy), overstatement (if you didn't already realise, loud = funny) and borderline homophobia. To paraphrase Repo Man, the longer you watch this, the stupider you might become.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
A lamentably unfunny flick.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
Five, six, seven, eight; Fired Up is not so great.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
This aggressively stupid comedy tries to have it both ways, advocating sexual probity while its cameras linger over acres of golden female thighs.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
Fired Up is a desperate and vacuous attempt at a teen comedy that not only lacks laughs, but even the gross-out moments and shameless nudity used by other such genre offerings.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
Clichéd execution, paper-thin characters.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
Fired Up is cinema as abuse, and its chief victim is any paying audience. To have shelled out cash for this witless farrago of sub-Porky's japery and straight-to-bargain-bin acting would be the airborne spin that broke the cheerleader's back.
 "
Fired Up,24,52,critic,"
Surprisingly, first-time director Will Gluck takes this raunchy premise and twists it into a boobs-free romantic comedy.

Examined Life,77,73,audience,Thought provoking interview of scientists who support: Intelligent Design. Must see!
Examined Life,77,73,audience,Interesting movie.  Wish they would have interviewed philosophers with a more conservative perspective just for the sake of balance.  Although in order to balance out Avital Ronell they would have had to interview Thomas Aquinas himself.
Examined Life,77,73,audience,"Makes for an intriguing film. At times funny, and at its best, insightful."
Examined Life,77,73,audience,"With the exception of two segments featuring Cornel West and Michael Hardt, this is a profoundly insipid documentary about the state of academic philosophy today. The ""going-for-a-walk"" format of each segment is gimmicky, and the ""insights"" of several interviewees -- notably Peter Singer and Martha Nussbaum -- are shockingly dim. I didn't like Taylor's documentary on Zizek, and this one proves to be just as fawning and banal."

For those interested in seeing philosophers on the screen, this engaging movie offers the opportunity to see eight of them walking the streets.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
The ones that work, Cornel West and Peter Singer for example, are intriguing and compelling but they don't all hang together so effortlessly.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
You can't help but feel that director Astra Taylor fails at her own challenge of making an academic subject come truly alive as cinema.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
A fascinating introduction to the big issues in modern philosophy, presented with a pleasantly light touch.

Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
Never dull, but it will make your head hurt.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
Each of the half-dozen or so thinkers gets around 20 minutes to maunder on - simultaneously not long enough and far too long. Frustratingly, no subject is investigated in depth, and the glibness is dull.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
This is an addictive and stimulating experience all round.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
Eccentric but always accessible, Taylor's boff-doc avoids the idiosyncrasy that her work has previously exhibited. In bringing philosophy into the real world, Examined Life is at once illuminating and intellectually stimulating.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
A film that can haunt you for the rest of your life.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
Although a sporadically stimulating and thoroughly challenging exercise, Examined Life too often feels like a forum for brainy big-thinkers' annoying penchant for being as inscrutable as possible.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
Taylor's stimulating film, enlivened by creative location shooting, will surely find an appreciative audience among highbrow cinephiles.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
Director-writer Astra Taylor wisely avoids turning this talk fest into a talking heads fest by filming these effusive intellectuals in a variety of visually diverting, real-world environments.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
Yes, examining philosophy for the greater effect it can have is admiral but it seems to get lost as the film jumps from one personality to another.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
There's plenty of food for thought here, though the movie is more a buffet than a meal.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
To [director Astra] Taylor's credit it's as inviting and accessible as a smart conversation with fascinating friends.
 "
Examined Life,77,73,critic,"
She gives eight thinkers 10 minutes each to unload on tough topics like the meaning of life and right and wrong and comes up mostly with a lot of platitudes about treating other people nice.

Watching ""Examined Life"" is sort of like sitting on a plane next to a total stranger who insists on making conversation. Except this is that one time out of 100 when the stranger turns out to be a completely fascinating person.

Comédias francesas não são um produto vasto no nosso quotidiano, embora recentemente tenhamos tido uma agradável surpresa com A Gaiola Dourada.
De facto, tentar trazer uma comédia à tona é uma tarefa complicada.
Num registo mais leve temos sempre Astérix e Obélix; Delicatessen (1991), de Jean-Pierre Jeunet, é também uma aposta segura, se bem que com um tom mais negro e macabro. Mas se quisermos apontar uma comédia dramática que possa agradar a toda a família, e proporcionar gargalhadas intensas, este filme é o ideal e, sem dúvida, uma das melhores surpresas no género.
Ao fim de alguns minutos de película torna-se fácil perceber o porquê de Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis se ter tornado o filme mais visto de sempre em França. A sua história tem um pouco de comum com a vida de qualquer pessoa e isso aproxima-nos do produto final de um ponto de vista emocional.
Philippe Abrams é um coordenador de postos de correio que, devido a uma infantilidade cometida no local de trabalho, é forçado a aceitar um novo emprego numa região remota da França, onde, aparentemente, se passeia um fim do mundo e um festival de ocorrências assustadoras. Ao deslocar-se para essa nova região francesa, Philippe começa a habituar-se aos costumes das redondenzas e das pessoas que as habitam. O filme é um retrato cómico, e ao mesmo tempo triste, da estranha relação que o Homem cria com o desconhecido. Já todos nós nos vimos fora da nossa zona de conforto, receosos de um tempo que inadvertidamente se nos introduz dolorosamente eterno, só para mais tarde chegarmos à conclusão de que agora é àquele sítio, outrora estranho, que agora pertencemos.
Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis não vai deixar ninguém indiferente, quer seja pela sua análise perspicaz às nossas emoções, quer seja pelos muitos e bons momentos de diversão que apresenta."

Welcome to the Land of Ch'tis,67,78,audience,"This is one of those movies that made me hate myself for not knowing the French language.

Great movie, very well acted and never gives you a chance to feel bored. It's a funny ride all the way from South of France to the Dreaded North. Hilarious."

Inkheart,39,45,audience,"This movie did start out really fun! However, halfway through, it did lose my interest. I felt  also that even for a movie that is only 100 minutes long, it felt overlong. I felt it should have been cut down. I get to make a 500 paged book into a hour and a half movie isn't easy, but still, I felt if they would have spent last time on the action, since the action scenes did feel very overlong. I feel this movie would have been more successful. It wasn't a bad film, but it's probably not gonna be a movie that I'd watch again for 30 years."
Inkheart,39,45,audience,"I think this movie is very fun, and exciting. When we see this movie, we could know thi smovie is extremely fun. My favorite character was meggie, that have her dad's gift.(silvertongue). It was a fun story that when the character reads the book, the character in the book came out. Next, l will tell the summary. Mo, who can bring characters to live (silvertongue), accidentally sets free the evil capricorn. 10 years later, his daughter meggie was silvertongue too, and they rescue her mom, his wife, and trap the villains.

If I had never read it, it might be good but the movie misses almost everything and is nothing like the book. In my opinion they could have done so much better. I am so disappointed in this movie. Wish it was good enough to watch."

Inkheart,39,45,audience,Love this movie! Great fun fantasy!
Inkheart,39,45,audience,I was hoping silver tongues would read passages from other books as defences and fighting back. It was worth being on TV but not in the movies. 
Inkheart,39,45,audience,"The supporting characters are actually far more intriguing than the story followed by Meggie and Mo. Unfortunately, the book is far better, when a movie based on it could have been much more magical and fascinating to the imagination. With the ending, it appears a sequel to be impossible, as the other books are based off the one specific point. That's probably a good thing."
Inkheart,39,45,audience,This movie is a really good adventure! Itï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s such an original movie there had never anything of the kind that was as good. This is obviously a really good and unique movie!

Saving Luna: The True Story of a Lone Orca,,100,audience,So I basically sobbed my way through this movie because it was so wonderfully bright but heartbreaking at the same time.
Saving Luna: The True Story of a Lone Orca,,100,audience,"I was lucky enough to win tickets to see this or otherwise I might not have heard about it.  The co-director Michael Parfit was there to answer questions after the showing which really added to the experience.  I was reminded of Farley Mowat's book A Whale for the Killing but I'm glad to say that in the time since Farley tried to save a right whale in Newfoundland humanity seems, for the most part, to have become more humane in its treatment of wild animals.  I also loved the cinematography which is of a very beautiful spot on Vancouver Island.  You could go just for that."
Saving Luna: The True Story of a Lone Orca,,100,audience,"Excellent movie. Really makes you think about our relationship with nature. It really shows how out of touch many city folks are (especially govenment beaurocrats). Very sad story, but uplifting too. Couldn't get a better leading actor than Luna. I guess if the same government types that made so many bad decisions about Luna are the same ones making decisions about the salmon fishery, then its easy to see why its going extinct."
Saving Luna: The True Story of a Lone Orca,,100,audience,"Highly recommended for the thinker/introspective type of people. 
Straightly as a film, it's 4-star. But the story it portrays , it's a 6-star! The story is so powerful and thought-provoking, both about the relationship between humans and wildlife, and humans and humans.  I left the  theater and spent a good extra hour just to reflect and to collect my thoughts."

The real-life story of Luna -- the orphaned male orca that found itself abandoned in 2001 in B.C.'s Nootka Sound and opted for human company over finding its pod -- begs big-budget Hollywood treatment.

Whether you loved or hated the idea of an orca seeking human company, the story resonated across generational lines and tugged at something deeper, perhaps even primal, in the human psyche. Because directors Parfit and Chisholm explore this psycho-spiritu

I liked that they depicted the intensity between the two woman without having to throw down and actually steamy sex scene, which would have been epic, but this movie did better with just showing that intensity and chemistry between the two women. it was very realistic and believable. i really enjoyed how the relationship between the two was grown and escalated. loved the ending it left up to imagination instead of giving a definite this is what happened type. Great acting I saw another movie with the same leading ladies they have such great on screen chemistry and really have good instinct when acting together. overall rather enjoyable. :) Recommend"

The World Unseen,27,69,audience,"Since I enjoyed the fim ""I Can't Think Straight"" from director Shamim Sarif, I surmised this one would be just as good but not quite. However; it is still a good, solid film with good acting and I am impressed with director Shamm Sarif (watch the interview with her under special features of the dvd). The film is somewhat interesting and it takes place in 1950's apartheid-ruled South Africa where two women of Indian origin begin a tenuous friendship. We have Miriam (played by Lisa Ray) who is a repressed housewife and mother of two, living in a remote house on the outskirts of Cape Town. Amina (played by Sheetal Sheth) is a rebel, â~masculineâ(TM) in thought, deed and dress, part-owner of the Location Cafe and misunderstood by her traditionalist family who only want to see her married off and domesticated. This is a touching story of friendship, of possible love between two human beings and how each one of them helps the other one. Kudos to Shamim Sarif for being able to bring to the big screen a movie that resonates with many people; that makes you feel so much empathy and understanding for the two female characters! And thank God I was not born during that difficult time period. Definitely recommended..."

College,5,27,audience,"2008:  Three high school guys (a nice guy, a nerd, and an overweight dude) go to a college over a weekend to experience the life.  They run into a group of fraternity guys who delight in hazing the high schoolers in various acts of raunchiness and disgust.  The high schoolers end up getting the revenge on the fraternity guys.  This movie seems to have ripped off several other movies, including ""Animal House"" and ""Revenge of the Nerds"".  In addition, the activity is beyond mean-spirited (even between the high school guys), and the raunchiness is over the top.  Can't recommend it.

Stars:  Drake Bell, Kevin Covais, Andrew Caldwell, Nick Zano, and Gary Owen."
College,5,27,audience,"Possibly the worst comedy of the decade and one of the worst of all-time. It's boring, unfunny and just downright dreadful."

College,5,27,audience,"Poor excuse of a college comedy that's unusually colder, duller, and more offensive than the genre typically is, but it offers no wit or laughs in order to redeem that lack of quality."
College,5,27,audience,"This movie is so shallow it makes Superbad come across as Citizen Kane. Stale dialogue. One likable character (Morris) with NO development turned any plot to be salvaged to the garbage disposal. It infuriates me knowing I can make a film with superior quality for literally less than 1/100 the price. Everyone should watch this movie before they apply to film school; and learn how to make cinematography, lighting, sound, dialogue, and acting performances meaningful before they shit money down the toilet."
College,5,27,audience,"'American Pie' - like 'Star Wars' - is a double edged sword. On the one hand, it's a great movie, one that people remember and probably will always remember. On the other hand, it has spawned hyperemetic, vomit inducing, iniquitous copy cats, like a little film called 'College'. In the words of one of the characters from the film: ""College fucking blows.""

The story, or lack of, is about 3 high school boys, Kevin(Drake Bell - from that tween show on Nickalodeon), Carter(Andrew Caldwell), and Morris(Kevin Covais - his feature debut - oooohhh)who decide to go to college for the weekend in order to play like the big boys. They get there, and of course, the 2 year difference between them and the college kids deems that they be unusually short and scrawny, while the college guys are tall and muscular. Well, one of the fraternities allows the boys to stay in their dank basement so that they can play horrible tricks and pranks on them.

Well, if you thought 'American Pie' was offensive, wait till you see(or hopefully don't see) Carter drinking alcohol that's being poured from a man's hairy butt crack. Offensive material in movies can work one of three ways: 1 - disturbia 2 - humor 3 - porn. 'College' is porn with an incoherent plot, useless characters and endless gimmicks designed solely around the fact that the filmmakers just want to show the audience giant, fake hooters and endless sex. And more sex. And more sex. And more masturbation. If there's a film out there that's more of an exploitation flick, I haven't seen it. Not even 'Porky's' stoops to the level of indecency that this movie so proudly exudes itself in.

By the end of it, the movie pretends to be a self discovery flick, where the characters realize that they don't need to drink and have sex all the time; they just need to exploit it to teenagers(who will see the film, despite it's 'R' rating - speaking of which, it should be 'NC-17' - and will, no doubt, be influenced by what happens on the screen). I hope teenagers are smarter than to be sucked in by the marketing ploy made by the producers for this nasty piece of work.

In short, this movie sucks ass. Literally."

College,5,27,audience,"Typical male teen comedy about a bunch of guys trying to get laid, and figuring going to a college would be the best way to go about that.  the story was predictable, but I will say that there were a few things thrown in that I didn't expect, but didn't necessarily want to see in the first place.  There were also some funny parts that did make me laugh.  Basically depending on your mood/sense of humour/maturity you may or may not like it.  Pretty vague I know but there it is"

Beaufort,85,72,audience,Unexceptional war film based in Lebanon and following a young band of occupying Israeli soldiers. Acting is OK and its shot well enough but it's not really stand out in any way.
Beaufort,85,72,audience,"Exciting at times, this movie does not consistently hold the viewer's interest."
Beaufort,85,72,audience,"It's well directed and shot, but says very little that hasn't been already said - and better - in a myriad of other war films. There are several unique and interesting scenes, but not enough for a movie of this length. The acting is also mediocre, so no help here either."
Beaufort,85,72,audience,"Following the lives of a battalion stationed at Beaufort. You never once see the enemy hezballah who rain down missiles on the guard post, nor the generals calling the shots of the war."
Beaufort,85,72,audience,"One thing I've learned from watching Israeli war films is that you must expect them to be like the american one, because in these film there's no heroes, no meaning nor any armed combats. The reason of course it's because it is so in real life. Beaufort was the name of a fortress located in the southern part of Lebanon which Israeli forces occupied from 1983-2000. In this film we follow the last mouths of the occupation when Beaufort still was fully armed. But rockets from Hezbollah rained down every day.

Beaufort main focus is on the Israeli soldiers long days doing nothing else but guarding their outpost and not getting hit by the rockets. The only thing to make the time pass is by talking, about who they are, their dreams and what they gonna do when they come home. But the risk of some one's getting killed is still there, and they know it, so every one looks forward to the withdrawal.

I can say as much that this is a real anti-war film, but the question is it a good movie because of that. I have to admit I was kind of bored because nothing really seams to happened, there was no armed fights, but rather a long distant one. But I feel that I must have in mind that the characters in the film is as bored as I am. But is that a good promises for a movie? I don't know. But I ending up giving this film a marginal thumbs up."
Beaufort,85,72,audience,"Beaufort refers to a military fortress held by Israeli troops during the occupation of Lebanon.  this film chronicles the tail end of the occupation for a group of soldiers positioned there.  We examine the day-to-day of these men as they slowly come to realization that withdrawing from Beaufort is a foregone conclusion.  The commanding officer, Liraz was the character which I found to be most interesting in the film.  He is a man that is raw and inexperienced, yet cares greatly about his fellow soldiers.  Every time they fortress is attacked, the viewer gets to experience the torment which Liraz goes through, knowing he is just following orders, but hates to see his men suffer.  The film doesnt have much action and explores a few of these soldiers, but Liraz, along with Ida, a soldier who sorely wants to go home, are the two which I was most interested in.  The film doesn't make any sweeping statements about the occupation, rather it just shows the lives of these soldiers and how they are essentially puppets just waiting for orders of what to do.   While it's a solid film the biggest problem I had is that it just doesn't bring anything new that I haven't seen in other films dealing with wartime.  It's cinematography has its moments but overall its rather mediocre, although there is some use of sound early on in the film which is like some sort o f faint whisper, that is perfect and really escalates the tension in the early goings of the film.  By no means a bad film and it has a few things that stand out, but its nothing you probably haven't seen before."
Beaufort,85,72,audience,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Unfortunately someone with the attention span of a five year old may not see it that way.
Beaufort,85,72,audience,"Well deserved Academy Award Nomination, but the pacing in this film was PAINFULLY slow.  However, the substance more than made up for the speed (lack there of).  Enjoyable to the end, truly an anti-war film in every sense of the phrase.  As much as we males love our glorious war films, there is certainly a place for films like Beaufort that portray a more realistic view of the battlefield without all of the excitement and power.  Instead, we are painted a picture of what seems like a pointless existence where, day in and day out, little changes and gains and losses are at a minimum.  Welcome to modern warfare, a true testament to stalemates, where politicians do the fighting and soldiers, landmarks, and territory play the political pawns while the wars themselves drag on for years and years.  On a more positive note, Beaufort certainly sets the precedent.. and the argument with regards to how important history is to a people, good or bad."
Beaufort,85,72,audience,"about the pointlessness of war, but way to overlong & slow. a group of bored soldiers in a outpost for 2hrs.you'll be even more bored as the random incoming shell isnt a danger to you."
