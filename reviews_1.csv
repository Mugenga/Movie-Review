Night Raiders,,,critic,"
The originality of the ending, which is a genuine and clever surprise, shows how cliched apocalyptic shoot-'em-ups have become.
 "
Night Raiders,,,critic,"
With impressive performances by the ensemble cast, Night Raiders is an exciting addition to the rising body of indigenous genre films, firmly establishing Goulet as a thrilling -- and skillful -- storyteller.

On the strength of its performances and overall filmmaking, Beans successfully weaves together an affecting drama.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Will get passed around between teenage girls the way Judy Blume books did back in the day.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Tracey Deer uses her background as a documentary filmmaker to good effect in editing together news footage of the protests and fights... ultimately a powerful and compelling film.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Deer lays out an incredible arc of self-discovery for Beans, and the journey is relatable from start to finish.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
An eye-opening and compelling story about the weight and oppression of racism, and the courage it takes to build a self in spite of it all.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
I left thinking who was this made for? It's definitely not for kids and it sure wasn't for me.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Fueled and propelled by the personal experiences it is based on, Beans is a deeply moving film, wrenching the heart as well as the gut in its raw urgency.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Beans achieves the laudable task of astutely dealing with an assortment of pertinent issues.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Tracey Deer's Beans is a flawed but incredibly moving about a 12-year-old Mohawk girl's political awakening during the Oka crisis.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
It is easy to tell that Deer put her absolute all into Beans and created a piece of art that is a stirring and eye-opening masterpiece.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
After almost a century of inaccurate representation, Beans is evidence that we have entered a Native cinema renaissance.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
If rendering their stories artfully through a camera lens opens just one mind, then ""Beans"" is already an unmitigated triumph.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Oddly listless and dramatically inert, leaving the unfortunate impression that the Mohawk uprising and its enduring legacy deserve a film that offers more than good intentions.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
An affecting personal spin on recent history.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Not that we needed any convincing, but Deer makes a strong argument for why representation and culturally-specific storytelling needs to be a vital part of cinema.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Kiawentiio is a gem.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Drawing upon her documentary roots, and her experience growing up in the Kahnawake Mohawk Territory, Beans poignantly intersects the personal and political.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
An accessible, unsanitized drama foregrounding Indigenous experience - one that doesn't hedge on depicting embedded Québécois racism and discrimination - [director Tracey Deer] is staking out a fertile patch of filmmaking terrain.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Deer's Beans exults as a sweet debut for both her and Kiawentiio.
 "
Beans,93,,critic,"
Beans is simultaneously a metaphor for what's happening and a depiction of its horrors [that's] astutely rendered and universally understood.

"Moon, 66 Questions",100,,critic,"
A captivating and painful film about repressed trauma that explores miscommunication as a basis for understanding family relationships. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
"Moon, 66 Questions",100,,critic,"
Moon, 66 Questions comes down to a predictable and inevitable end but I would be lying if I said I wasn't moved by it.
 "
"Moon, 66 Questions",100,,critic,"
The tidal currents of Moon, 66 Questions gently pull us out into an ocean of captivating gaps, ellipses and silences, granting an enormously rich emotional rich experience for those willing to go with its flow.
 "
"Moon, 66 Questions",100,,critic,"
Delicate and empathetic, Moon, 66 Questions is an impressive debut feature. Part coming-of-age, part illness narrative, the film is above all an intimate portrait of Artemis as she is forced to reevaluate her relationship with her father.
 "
"Moon, 66 Questions",100,,critic,"
Jacqueline Lentzou's intriguing, unconventional feature debut eschews anything as trite as a big emotional rapprochement, but it does ultimately carve out a shared emotional space for the pair.
 "
Memory Box,89,,critic,"
There's an amazing shot of Raja and Maia on his motorbike, racing down a city promenade as bullets whiz through the air around them.
 "
Memory Box,89,,critic,"
It's introspective, affecting, and an visually inventive depiction of how memory, good or bad, plays a huge part in shaping us in the present. Hadjithomas and Joreige have done it again.
 "
Memory Box,89,,critic,"
Ultimately transcending the personal, Memory Box documents a greater part of Lebanese history through the lives of its characters. The film itself becomes a curated time capsule, filled with sensual and visual impressions that last long after viewing.
 "
Memory Box,89,,critic,"
Memory Box brings buried memories back to life in its tale of New Wave teen dreams (and nightmares) in wartime Beirut in a fresh, poignant and deeply personal way.
 "
Memory Box,89,,critic,"
A monotony sets in with Memory Box and ultimately feels like an intimate portrait more meaningful for its makers than the audience.
 "
Memory Box,89,,critic,"
Becomes an intoxicating cocktail of recollections while also addressing how different generations process the touchstone triggers of memory.
 "
Memory Box,89,,critic,"
This affecting drama tackles intergenerational trauma while espousing the value of preserving the past for future generations.
 "
Memory Box,89,,critic,"
A warm, dense tale about women.
 "
Memory Box,89,,critic,"
The film overcomes a conventional set-up and framework to blossom into an imaginative and touching evocation of her Beirut adolescence in the 1980s.
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
It's fascinating to see how well some filmmakers are working within the pandemic restraints, and Ms. Morales does the most possible for her film with what it's got to use.
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
What could have been a topical, forgettable sketch winds up speaking to an anxiety and pain that's true and universal.
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
This exceedingly modest tale of a Spanish-language instructor and pupil who meet online becomes more genially engaging as it goes along, although it never aims very high other than as a technical experiment that more or less succeeds.
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
A charming small-scale production made to be viewed on a laptop screen, Language Lessons is still an admirable feat, successfully highlighting the importance of emotional connections above anything else.
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
Language Lessons reduces me to monosyllables; it is just pure and good and hard and kind and - ultimately - just so, so, so real.
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
Language Lessons find the ways in which words can fail us in times of uncertainty, but expresses itself with impressive clarity.
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
Zoom fatigue may be real, but ""Language Lessons"" ventures to show how true connection can come at any time, and through any medium, barriers be damned.
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
Had the film trusted its self-imposed minimalism a little more, it might have been a lot more successful as a character study.
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
Films explicitly about the formation of friendships are rare, and Morales and Duplass have fashioned rather a perceptive one...
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
Slender but sweet.
 "
Language Lessons,91,,critic,"
Morales and Duplass convincingly convey a fluctuating platonic bond, even if Cariño proves the more complex and fleshed-out character at every turn.
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
A strange but hypnotic gay love story sits at the heart of this politically charged pic.
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
The venerable veteran director Agnieszka Holland has made a tasty, if not fully-baked, biographical drama about an obstinate man whose life was as difficult as he was.
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
Charlatan uses Mikoláek as a sort of metaphor for post-war communism in order to ask whether the new regime is really a form of liberation or just a variation on a fascist theme.
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
'Charlatan' asks too many questions it seems unwilling to answer.
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
Jan Mikoláek isn't the only charlatan here, that title also qualifies the makers of this fraud. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
Despite the turbulent events of Mikoláek's life, Holland and screenwriter Marek Epstein have produced a remarkably calm film.
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
Polish director Agnieszka Holland has made another fascinating but disjointed biopic about a little-known figure whose story helps to reveal the soul of 20th century Europe.
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
[A] handsome, intelligently questioning but slightly dry biopic.
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
It's easily accessible on a visual level while being remarkably inexpressive on a sub-textual one.
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
A rich psychological puzzle about a compromised political survivor.
 "
Charlatan,91,,critic,"
It is intriguing, if a little frustrating...

Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,audience,Sexual orientation is on the line in this funny documentary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,audience,"Documentarian David France chronicles the anti-gay purges in Chechnya during the late 2010s. LGBT Chechen refugees with the help of hidden cameras give the viewer an inside look at how they get out of Russia through a network of safehouses aided by activists who are trying to shed light on the human rights abuses in Chechnya.  The faces in the film are not real, but they are computer generated because they would not be safe if recognized.  This story should be on national news every day until queer people stop being killed for no reason.  This is a very tough watch and a break or two may be needed just to wrap your mind around what you just saw.  Final Score: 9/10"
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,audience,"""Welcome to Chechnya"" documents the persecution of gay men and lesbian women in Chechnya, a republic of the Russian Federation. It follows the Moscow Community Center LGBT group and their efforts to shelter gay people in danger, including ""Grisha"" (later revealed to be Maxim Lapunov), an event planner who is not even ethnically Chechnyan. The story is powerful, gripping, and tense, and at times hard to watch, especially when they intercut candid footage of gays being beat up."
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,audience,"Welcome to Chechnya offers a tragic, intense and important look into the atrocious gay purges happening in this questionable region. The film needed to have more facts in it and it is overly modern in approach, but that still mostly worked as the thriller elements are successfully executed, many scenes here are very suspenseful and moving, and the movie's use of VFX is very strong and unique."
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,audience,Some of the bravest men and women I have ever seen. A sobering documentary that everyone should see.
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,audience,"Shocking, infuriating and extremely important. The cruelty experienced by Chechnya’s LGBT community should be known by all who care about human rights and dignity. "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,audience,"It's hard to write a review because this is an important subject matter. But I think it was a very poorly made documentary for a very important subject. It was very traumatic to watch because of how it focused on certain very violent, graphic scenes, rather than presenting the subjects as people. I wanted to learn more about the victims, their lives, rather than being force fed horrific videos. Many of the videos should come with a warning - there is a scene of an attempted suicide with graphic video involving blood, there is a very very graphic scene showing a rape happening involving a man. This to me was very concerning, I don't believe this video would have been shown if it was a woman. What does this serve, to show these very graphic videos? There are so many graphic videos online of people being killed, or tortured to the point where it is almost ""porn"" to some people and it encourages desensitization and it is very traumatic to view for people who may have experienced these things or who are sensitive. There are no warnings when you watch the film however, so I am warning you now. I would have rather read about these issues than ever watch this film. I used to work for an international tribunal on genocide and war crimes so I am no stranger to reading about horrific things but I try to understand the issues rather than have graphic imagery being forcefed to me. I did make a donation to the center after watching the film. I hope to learn more about the stories about the people involved in the film from articles or a better made film in the future that doesn't try to reduce the people to graphic scenes. It reminds me of the American version of the movie Traffic that focused on violence and divisiveness versus the British series that actually captured the stories inclusively and explained the situation better."
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,audience,"The whole world should be aware of this outrage, that nobody knows about.  It's unbelievable that these things keep happening."
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,audience,"The filmmaker and his ""subjects"" are amazing. This documentary is horrifying, compelling, and yet somehow hopeful. Highly recommend"

Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
Feels all too real.
 "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
Welcome to Chechnya is a stunner not just because of what it shows, but for its clear implication that what is portrayed is barely a fraction of the mass terror currently taking place.
 "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
This documentary shows the horror of what happens when the power of society, customs and religion are all focused on eliminating a certain segment of the population.
 "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
It's the stuff of gripping Cold War espionage thrillers, except that this is real life.
 "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
If there's any documentary that could bring the beatings and horror alive, it was Welcome to Chechnya: The Gay Purge.
 "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
With harrowing, often nauseating testimony and the incredibly clever, digital alteration of faces, it shows how a ""lucky"" few have been smuggled out and given shelter by the Russian LGBT Network, with the aim of flying them to safety in Canada.
 "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
France's documentary is suffocating, as testimonies are interspersed with confiscated videos of police brutality and mob violence... What makes France's film compelling, however, is its immediacy.
 "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
Welcome to Chechnya: The Gay Purge. brought home the horror with a dramatic urgency. David France's grimly compelling film was a docu-thriller, with heart-stopping moments as activists spirited people out of the country in clandestine operations.
 "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
Welcome to Chechnya is a blisteringly painful watch, one that imparts new meaning on the practice of bearing witness. This is the kind of film destined to be on ""essential"" documentary lists for decades to come.
 "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
France sensitively draws out the personalities of his subjects, ensuring that, despite the digital disguises and pseudonyms, they emerge as distinct individuals.
 "
Welcome to Chechnya,100,85,critic,"
David France has made a difficult, distressing and often tremendously bleak film about the torture and murder of LGBT people in Chechnya, and the brave efforts of community activists and organisers to ""extract"" them from the region.

The queer people of Chechnya live in fear day and night, at home and in public. Chechnya the movie blends this terrifying message with glimmers of hope and resistance.

Welcome to Chechnya is nothing short of sounding the alarm that there is a modern-day holocaust of LGBTQ people.

Delete History,80,,critic,"
A grotesque film in the same way that a certain precisely French literary tradition can be. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Delete History,80,,critic,"
Drawn into complete ridicule, there is very little that remains relatable, and the superficial narrative which leads all three to ultimately renounce their digital dependency (at least for a while) fails to move.

After the laughter dies down, the bitterness of Delepine and Kervern's analysis on the sad-sack-sorry state of the world we live in remains.

 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
With no real sense of climax, the only viable option is to decelerate events back to normality.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
Whishaw is utterly compelling and committed to this performance, and we watch the slow-motion car crash unfurl with mouths often agape, but Surge needs more depth to really leave a lasting mark.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
At times it feels relentless. Indeed, where Surge is most successful is in transferring the anxiety and anxiousness of its lead onto its viewers.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
In this most unforgiving of ages, that hard-won sympathy for mental illness makes Surge a deeply political film, drawing our gaze to what is usually overlooked or dismissed - even as the film also whispers into our ears its recognition of us all.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
Whishaw's work is a masterclass in not just carrying a practical one-man show, but crafting a wordless character arc.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
It's undoubtedly Whishaw who keeps the film compelling with his startling performance, even when the script stumbles somewhat in the final half hour.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
Whatever your mileage for such an actor-y showcase performance, Surge will certainly test it.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
Whishaw's talent deserves more.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
Set over 24 hours, Anei Karia's Surge takes a cracked mind and lets it spill out and, be it through self-discovery or self-destruction, finds the humor in life's absurdism.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
Joseph's actions don't build to a satisfying ending the way they needed to for this film to work.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
The sound design in Surge submerges us in a fractured mind, but that doesn't save the film from feeling like Ben Whishaw's discarded Joker audition tape.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
Even though Whishaw is mesmeric, by the end of the 105-minute running time the whole experience starts to feel like being trapped in a broken-down subway car with a violent mental patient.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
The story of a mentally ill man with built-up rage boiling inside, which is one of the scariest things you can imagine in today's world. The film is disappointing because none of these issues are explored in greater depth.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
As an experiment in steering a potentially tight thriller entirely by one character's irrational whims, it's abrasively compelling, even if the go-go-go plotting doesn't withstand closest scrutiny.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
It's a shame that the screenplay by Rupert Jones and Rita Kalnejais didn't dig further. As a showcase for Karia's talents as a visualist, though, it works.
 "
Surge,63,,critic,"
Karia is a smart film-maker and this is a valuable beginning.

Shirley,87,55,audience,haunting and original take on a biopic
Shirley,87,55,audience,"Good acting, boring story. Drags on and on and it's not even really about much.... Wouldn't recommend. There's other movies out there. "
Shirley,87,55,audience,"It's messy, confusing and all over the place but Elizabeth Moss is one hell of an actress. Her performance is captivating and while Shirley is a boring psychological thriller, it's watchable thanks to her."
Shirley,87,55,audience,"Kind of a weird movie, not sure if I'd like it if I wasn't a big Shirley Jackson fan. Regardless, ok concept, solid execution."
Shirley,87,55,audience,Beautiful performances. Very underrated film.
Shirley,87,55,audience,"Slow and hard to stay in touch with. Continually bored throughout. Acting was a good saving grace as well as the soundtrack. Wouldn't define as a horror, not scary in the slightest."
Shirley,87,55,audience,"If you're looking for a formulaic biopic of acclaimed horror writer Shirley Jackson, this is not the place to look. 'Shirley' is a slow-burning, mesmerizing and deliberately sinister adaptation of the eponymous novel of the same name written by Susan Scarf Merrell. It follows a young couple, Rose and Fred Nemser, played by Odessa Young and Logan Lerman being taken in by Shirley Jackson and her husband Stanley Hyman, played superbly by Elizabeth Moss and Michael Stuhlbarg, while Fred is being mentored by Stanley to become a young professor.

In a 'Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf'-ish setting, Rose, the main character and audience stand-in, observes the complicated, mostly toxic, sexual and inter-personal dynamics between Shirley and Stanley slowly unfolding between her eyes, all while falling into the rabbit hole of Shirley's novel in progress about a local girl's disappearance. The film is merely a complex game of domination and submission between the fascinating foursome, with gender roles swapping as quickly and frequently as the roles of victim and aggressor. Elizabeth Moss crafts an act of pure witchcraft in Shirley's portrayal, projecting the woman's complex power with underlying sexual tones onto Young's impressionable but strong Rose.

Jackson, with her intimate close-ups, clever use of low focus and enthralling naturalistic shots, creates a mix of themes as elusive as the film itself, navigating between the ineffable connection between femininity and creation to the contradiction between the sheer freedom found in separating oneself from the opposite sex and an inexplicable necessity to remain connected to it in order to truly flourish."
Shirley,87,55,audience,I'm glad there was an attempt to emulate Jackson's writing style in this portrayal but the probing of the characters never gets beyond surface level observations.
Shirley,87,55,audience,This movie feels so so long and I feel like I've watched nothing. Acting is amazing but the story is dull. I would have rather taken a nap.
Shirley,87,55,audience,"A: 3/5
E: 3/5
R: 3.5/5"
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
The proposal is... effective, although so much excess is at times unnecessary, especially when you have a very good actress and she's portraying a writer who is so fond of forcefulness and narrative clarity. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
[Josephine Decker] displays a mastery of the medium in a story that defies easy and precise articulation. Her portrait of the creative process as an atmospheric thriller is subversively spooky in a way Shirley herself would approve.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
Shirleyis a psychosexual, theatrical piece buoyed by the magnetism of Moss and Stuhlbarg's loathsome performances, but sometimes at the expense of riveting drama.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
While it's clear that Shirley is supposed to be a type of psychological thriller, the way its story is told and the imagery used to tell it make it less than thrilling.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
Decker's distorted dream-like visual approach is often beautiful, as though we're looking through a psychological prism. It creates atmosphere but doesn't provide the thrills that Jackson herself might have infused into the telling of this tale.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
Shirley is an unadulterated delight, and it is not a prerequisite for you to have read or even heard about Shirley Jackson. This is a story for everyone.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
Shirley has far different aims than does the usual laundry-list biopic, but it's far, far more powerful for it.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
Despair, desire, and madness are all entangled in Josephine Decker's Shirley...
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
'Shirley' will likely pull decent enough numbers, but it feels like it wants to lean into its crazy solely by telling us about it rather than showing us.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
Shirley is a rollercoaster of emotions that will have the viewer getting in line to experience again.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
The look of the film is as lively as the story is sluggish. The acting, by the three main characters, however, is very strong. Overall, the story is not compelling, and the characters are unappealing.

In the end, there's no ambiguity to be found, just pure madness and deception.

Shirley,87,55,critic,"
A look at the very morose Shirley Jackson (Elisabeth Moss), presented in a way that mimics the famed fiction author's horror writing...
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
With Moss and Young on superb form, it's a film that doesn't just provide a warts-and-all portrait of its eponymous subject - it's also full of revealing insights into the sorry lot of women in sexist 1950s America.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
Elisabeth Moss and Michael Stuhlbarg devour their roles with fearless prickliness and predatory slyness.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
It's a riveting film with skillful performances from this small ensemble cast of characters who deftly convey their innocence or regrets as they look into their rear view mirror or crystal ball of life.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
It's worth seeing for their craft and the cast's uniformly excellent performances, but if you're after a movie about Shirley Jackson's life, or a filmic taste of her style, or preoccupations as a writer, you'll have to go back to the books.
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
Shirley is a hypnotic psychodrama that takes the literary essence of Shirley Jackson and translates it into audiovisual language. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Shirley,87,55,critic,"
Decker's style of creating ominous tension while using soft focus lenses adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty which Shirley poses, almost as if trying to recreate one of the author's novels themselves.
 "

Shirley is frustrating because it's difficult to dismiss. It's narratively effective and its dreamy and nightmarish sequences are aesthetically pleasing.

The Intruder,59,,critic,"
Had Meta stayed as engaged throughout as her filmmaking is at the start and end, pushed a little firmer at key moments, this could have really landed.
 "

The Intruder walks its own path, striding in and out of genres with momentum. However, this wayward nature proves the film's undoing as audiences can become disconnected with the emotional journey.
 "
The Intruder,59,,critic,"
Beyond a decent central performance and a glimmer of genre pastiche, there's very little for anybody to chew on.
 "
The Intruder,59,,critic,"
a bizarre psychological thriller about the real effects of trauma.
 "
The Intruder,59,,critic,"
The Intruder begins with a mountain of good ideas but it seems to prefer the view at the half-way point, remaining ambiguous throughout, unfortunately not in terms of story, but in terms of enjoyment.
 "
The Intruder,59,,critic,"
Érica Rivas' sensational performance rescues an enticing horror film which nevertheless struggles to conjure a satisfying resolution.
 "
The Intruder,59,,critic,"
Audiences looking for a straightforward psychological thriller with some planted scares will be pleasantly surprised with what it has to offer. It's a film that has so much to say, and luckily, uses the great Érica Rivas as its capably talented messenger.
 "
The Intruder,59,,critic,"
The lack of genuine thrills, however cheesy or implausible, proved a turn-off.

""The Intruder"" generates so much intrigue to maintain a breathless pace and unsettling atmosphere at every turn, with Rives' layered performance fusing the strange trip together.
 "
The Intruder,59,,critic,"
An oddly flavorless supernatural psycho-thriller from sophomore Argentinian director Natalia Meta.
 "
The Intruder,59,,critic,"
Fun, efficient, and snappy, The Intruder is a pleasurable example of how genre remains a potent mechanism to wheedle its way under our skin, allowing its subtexts to ruminate.
 "
The Intruder,59,,critic,"
Like the ragged mental state of its main character, it unravels as it goes on. But it is also never less than stridently entertaining, in part thanks to a brittle central performance from Erica Rivas.
 "
The Intruder,59,,critic,"
The spirit of the film is one of mischievous fun, and the story's refusal to take itself seriously wins a regular laugh.
 "
My Little Sister,92,,audience,"A beautiful film about the love between a set of fraternal twins.  Every actor is pretty much just right, and the choice of music and the understated, lyrical cinematography makes this little film a piece of great art.  The two directors of this film must be geniuses.  This lovely, quiet picture will make you better for having watched it."
My Little Sister,92,,critic,"
This is another intimate, personal tale from writer-director duo Stéphanie Chuat and Véronique Reymond... and boasts standout scenes and characters you believe in, for all their flaws. It is also moving without being mawkish.

My Little Sister is many things, but tragedy porn it is not. Once one gets on the same wavelength with the movie, a wonderful sibling relationship unfolds.

Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,46,audience,"An intimate, delicate, and agonizing portrait of a young girl facing an unwanted pregnancy, that depicts the dangers that represent being a woman, out alone, in a world that seems to be against her for just being.

A very necessary and relevant view, if you ask me."
Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,46,audience,"What a horrible movie. With all the great reviews there had to be something to this movie, but nothing ever happened. The story could have been told in a 15 minute short."
Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,46,audience,Unwatchable. No dialogue. Almost a silent film.
Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,46,audience,"It is one of the best films that demonstrates women's rights without it feeling forced. Hittman puts these two young teenage girls in a very believable situation and shows how life does not give easy paths for everyone. It's a simple story with a very powerful message that can be viewed by almost everyone. 

Full analysis - https://backseatdirectors.com/2020/04/review-never-rarely-sometimes-always/"
Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,46,audience,"Uncomfortable. Intimate. Gentle. Gripping.

Just some of the words I can think of to describe Never Rarely Sometimes Always. This grim story does not withhold any detail, yet is as soft spoken as a film can get. The dialogue, especially between the medical staff and the main character, is so realistic that it almost leaves you with a feeling of being invasive or out of bounds. The two main characters are absolutely at their best in their roles."
Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,46,audience,"Though the intent is clear, so is the idea of normalizing abortion and this isn't where the focus should lie. This intent is also why the film struck me as unpleasant from the beginning; not solely because of the content, but largely because of its tone. I get it, men are terrible for the most part and its understandable why Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) only sees the worst in the men she observes as they each bring it upon themselves. Whether it be her father/step-father/mom's boyfriend (it never really clarifies) who shows more affection to the dog than his would-be daughter to the guy checking out at the grocery store where Autumn and her best friend Skylar (Talia Ryder) work who thinks a kind inquiry about his purchase is code for these clearly underage girls desiring to attend the party he's throwing. Why would anyone want to bring a life into this degrading, disgusting, one-sided society? 

The intent is clear, but writer/director Eliza Hittman's Never Rarely Sometimes Always looks to criticize the healthcare system more so than it does the lack of humanity that has brought this girl, this baby herself, to thinking that abortion is the only option. I hate the idea that abortions exist, are acceptable, and are carried out despite understanding that worse things could happen were services such as this not provided and that less abortions happen when more money is given to resources built to help young women in the same situation as Autumn. I understand that no one in their right mind is pro-abortion and that it's a last resort and I understand even more that most people care only about whether or not the child is born rather than what happens to that child once it's born, but every child born - every life - is an opportunity to swing this society that is so lost and self-consumed back toward the balance of empathy and love. That's optimistic, sure, but while the intent is clear and Autumn's plight is devastating and more destructive to her than she'll ever let on, it's difficult still to not want to choose optimism over a last resort."
Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,46,audience,"This was too real, too raw, too precise and it had me sobbing."
Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,46,audience,"Never Rarely Sometimes Always' extreme austerity, instead of serving the gravity of the film's subject, just makes it completely flat, not helped by the dull performances of its mostly non-professional cast."

The Roads Not Taken is a film that will undoubtedly resonate with those who have had similar experiences, but will likely fail to captivate an audience looking for anything more than personal reflection...

Pinocchio,84,40,audience,An absolutely brain-numbing & very slow-paced movie!
Pinocchio,84,40,audience,Don’t take young kids. I took my six year olds. She didn’t hate it but I was bothered by the hanging scene. Just too dark for young kids. I was very bored and did not find it funny.

Pinocchio,84,40,audience,It was beautiful visually but the story was a little chaotic for me but I’ve only seen the Disney cartoon to compare.   I enjoyed it.

Pinocchio,84,40,audience,Good movie packed with lots of adventures. A few “scary” scenes but my 6yr old was ok.
Pinocchio,84,40,audience,One of the worst all time movies I’ve ever seen. Don’t waste your money as this movie is laughable. Absolute trash!
Pinocchio,84,40,audience,Beautiful movie!!! My child inside was very happy!!!
Pinocchio,84,40,audience,"This Italian filmed version of the classic tale of Pinocchio, a little boy who was lovingly carved and chiseled out of wood is magical!  The prosthetic wizardry of the make up and costuming is remarkable.  The little boy who played Pinocchio is great!  The one thing I regret is that Roberto Benigni was not on screen for a goodlier portion of this fantasy film.  The soft focus cinematography adds to the period piece which is simply beautiful.  The characters appear to be in the turn of the century (20th) from the preceding Victorian era (I know - two different regions and manner of dress and clothing) but - this is a miracle film and the clothing and settings are of this time period - it gives confidence to all ages who have been the brunt of bullying and learning about real life the hard way.  The almost gargoylian appearance of the fantasy characters is something that can teach 'Hollywood' films a lesson - you do not need all those CGI's and computerized f/x to get into the Alice in Wonderland all over experience.  I initially talked my friend and co-cinemaphile, to attend this film with me.  At first - the dialogue is somewhat stinted and feels as if it was still in Italian, but the accents - which are real - make the rendering of the script into English a fait accompli!  I do not understand why the other reviewers did not like, or perhaps understand, what went into making this film.  Pinocchio, the character, is not an animated variation of the original darker story - this is true to a n ethereal experience that makes the time fly - great pacing - and the entire ensemble have a depth that no animated feature can truly achieve - this is definitely a film for adults and youngsters (although I would suggest that under the age of 5 would not understand its impact and become restless during the screening), although the greatest lesson for youngsters may be gleaned from this tale - be true to yourself, be true to your maker, be blessed by your own ability to create and be positive about the gift of life.  Geppeto (Benigni certainly is the father that even the poorest peasants can see loves deeply and wants a better life for his son - and when the magic of non-impulsive whims are shown to be the righteous path, Pinocchio and Gepetto walk arm and arm in the flesh.  BTW - the mint green haired fairy - who astonishingly does age on screen - most versions of 'fairies' show them as simply stuck in time - age-wise - creatures that try and steer the confused ones to find the meaning of real life..in the ending, Pinocchio does capture that dream!  Accolades and kudos for this FINE film that I hope will not be bypassed by the awards this coming year.  I know I will see it again and again, for the film itself is a work of art. It is become, indeed, a timeless classic!"

The result is a bizarre fairytale extravaganza, and Garonne should be credited for the thoughtful way he has brought his vision to life.

Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
A beautiful and cleverly crafted piece which manages to be a faithful return to Collodi's original tale and very much the director's own take.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
This movie should not be bad.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
Right from the start, Garrone's Pinocchio seems like a real boy, which makes it even more disturbing, and delightful, when the wood becomes flesh.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
Garrone's steady eye for the bizarre and ironic ensures an engrossing spectacle to spark children's imaginations, in a world adults will wearily vouch for.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
Pinocchio's ultimate transformation from puppet to human boy lacks much of the transcendence inherent in the parable, and thus the film never moves beyond its wooden machinations.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
Get our your handkerchiefs for this gorgeous, live-action take from Italy on the Disney animated classic, starring Oscar winner Roberto Benigni as Geppetto, the woodcutter who builds a puppet to replace the son he never had.

Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
It has the makings of a stealth classic.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
Fairy tales have always held the threat of darkness as punishment for misbehavior, and this ""Pinocchio"" is no exception.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
Garrone's take is darker than Uncle Walt's, but like Disney, he imbues his take with a reliable sense of wonder. As a result, Pinocchio's path away from being a literal blockhead is delightful.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
This new cinematic imagining of Carlo Collodi's classic fantasy tale is alternately enchanting and befuddling.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
The visuals are inventive, though not as spectacularly scary as Disney's depiction of the fish as Monstro the whale.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
... boasts picturesque landscapes but some curiously detached storytelling while attempting to capture the darker aspects of the familiar source material.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
Those accustomed to the softness of previous takes might be overwhelmed by this picture, which is imaginatively made with amazing technical achievements, but not an endeavor that touches the heart.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
Matteo Garrone's wonderfully bizarre and visually stunning take on the classic tale is a genuine movie treat.
 "
Pinocchio,84,40,critic,"
The film itself remains stuck in a half-baked fantasyland, hopelessly awash in its own unpleasantness and with nothing new to bring to its well-worn table.

Nighthawk,92,85,audience,"In the words of the great Dom Toretto,


""This is BRAZIL!"""
Nighthawk,92,85,audience,I came for the Brazilian scenery and beautiful actress. I stayed for the brutal critique of American imperialism.
Nighthawk,92,85,audience,"Starts off like it might be a comedy, but is very dark and disturbing.  Solid performances and great directing."
Nighthawk,92,85,audience,Nope.  No thanks.  Uh uh.
Nighthawk,92,85,audience,"One of last year's most noteworthy and impressive films is the Brazilian produced Bacurau. A masterclass in form and genre subversion, the film follows a series of bizarre and violent events happening in a small eponymous Brazilian town, regarding cruel and vicious invaders, visualized through the eyes of various members of its tightly-knit community working in a sacred togetherness to defend their home. You've surely heard this premise countless times and it sounds entirely predictable, but Bacurau is anything but.

There are themes of ancestral concepts of family and community, the inevitable enforcing of divine providence. There is a nuanced critique of systemic political misconceptions, there is a a harsh satire of the well-known American cultural shalowness, all packed in the challenging form of a neo-Western. Nonetheless, the real spark of brilliancy in Bacurau is the fact that it cinematically and thematically encompasses all of the above. Such an organic integration of a vision so large in scope would never have been possible without a large, impressive cast and layers upon layers of subversion.

Dornelles and Filho's mastery of their craft and suitably diverse inspirations from the depths of American cinema ensure a savory cinematic experience, sweet and sour at the same time. I believe if Tarantino were born in Brazil, his films would have something of Bacurau's varied blend of spices."
Nighthawk,92,85,audience,"Bacurau is a bizarre genre bending film that has to be seen to be believed. The entire cast was very solid. The story is consistently interesting. It starts off very normal, setting up what this town was like. But then slowly but surely it takes a turn. The film mashes up many genres while still keeping a consistent tone. The violence is wonderfully gory and well earned. It also has sociopolitical commentary that works very well. Overall, this was great. I wanna say as little as I can as possible. Go in blind, and enjoy the insanity. "
Nighthawk,92,85,audience,"un panorama de una brasil desconocido pero con profundidad, es grato ver que el cine exprese esas historias con toques humanos tanto que lo hacen universales."

There are entire books to be written about how Bacurau uses its narrative to confront capitalist exploitation of Brazil, as well as violent native resistance against internal corruption and international colonialism.

And yet, these faults pale in comparison to the auspicious first half. As the credits roll, the general feeling is of a wild tale well told.
 "

Though if you haven't heard anything about it, that's even better. It helps to go into Bacurau knowing as little as possible, so that the delights of confounded expectations can work to their fullest extent...

The Extraordinary Journey of Celeste Garcia (El viaje extraordinario de Celeste García),67,,audience,"A fun, delightful yet thought-provoking little comedy that fills much bigger shoes than what one might think at first glance. When a retired teacher and volunteer planetarium docent who has led a largely frustrating life is part of an alien-invited contingent to visit their faraway world, she looks forward to the prospect of being able to start over. But is the offer all it's cracked up to be? And is it what she really wants? That's what she must wrestle with in this quirky but insightful Cuban offering full of colorful characters, offbeat incidents and absurdist humor, with ample symbolic political commentary thrown in for good measure. There's more going on than meets the eye in this one, so pay close attention and don't be so quick to dismiss it as throwaway fluff."
The Extraordinary Journey of Celeste Garcia (El viaje extraordinario de Celeste García),67,,critic,"
What starts out as an absurd premise start to lose steam in the final act as the film focuses more on Celeste's inward journey of self-discovery - and less on the light satire of Cuban bureaucracy. Still, it's an utterly enjoyable ride.
 "
The Extraordinary Journey of Celeste Garcia (El viaje extraordinario de Celeste García),67,,critic,"
Celeste García is a truly original and affectionately humorous take on the sci-fi genre. Instead of focusing on the actual space travel, the film foregrounds the very human emotions of those desperate to escape their mundane existence.

Vita & Virginia,42,61,audience,"Very much liked it. Literary, pretty and gay."
Vita & Virginia,42,61,audience,Needs more context & more realism
Vita & Virginia,42,61,audience,"I feel a lot of people who found this film 'boring' or are giving it negative reviews didn't really understand it. This is a film made by women for women. There are so few good films about queer women, especially bisexual polyamorous women, this was just the kind of film we needed following the success of films like Carol. It was beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and really just a compelling representation of Vita Sackville-West's and Virginia Woolf's relationship. I think some people might think the monologues an odd choice, but the film was adapted from a play, which was adapted from the letters between these women, so it was a very conscious decision. If you love Virginia Woolf and/or if you are a queer woman, ignore the negative reviews. This film does not need to be validated by the heteropatriarchal norms upheld by the film industry. This is our film."
Vita & Virginia,42,61,audience,Odd strange music throughout - every time I heard it the period mood was broken. Other than that it was an interesting movie.
Vita & Virginia,42,61,audience,"The synthesizer score is annoying A-F. No themes are established as Vangelis did with BLADE RUNNER and CHARIOTS OF FIRE. It's hailed as ""Elizabeth Debicki's actual heartbeat"" -- and it does nothing for what I was seeing on screen. The electronic score, while subtle, was distracting every time it crept in, pulling me out of the visuals.

I like both lead actors a lot and the supporting cast is strong. The sets and costumes are glorious. I blame the director for the failings of this piece.

The script -- based on correspondence between the women -- veers away from the source material at times, so why couldn't it tell more about Virginia's mental health issues. Instead, Virginia's moods come across as disjointed. The film should have been able to establish this without viewers needing foreknowledge of the historic characters.

A multitude of shots feel static, and some of the action feels divorced from what's being said. All the pieces are here, but it never came together for me."
Vita & Virginia,42,61,audience,Gemma Arterton and Elizabeth Debicki are the two main leads that hold this movie afloat. A strong connection is felt between these two characters throughout. My only concern was the electronic music at the beginning of the movie because it didn’t quite fit the period of the time. 
Vita & Virginia,42,61,audience,"Multiple issues lead to the downfall of a great idea. The lack of chemistry between the actresses and Arteton's portrayal of Vita left the movie feeling stale and cold. The odd, ambient soundtrack felt rough and out of place, making this film feel messy overall. The effects of the forest and birds looked cheap and were left unexplained. Part of me feels this movie would work better as a theatre piece. Overall, this was a great idea with some mildly pleasing moments but bad casting and a catastrophic script left this movie feeling cold and monotone."
Vita & Virginia,42,61,audience,An absolutely wonderful film!

Much of the dialogue in Vita and Virginia is scooped directly from love letters exchanged between the writers - which, unfortunately, makes for a rather cumbersome screenplay.

Destination Wedding,51,57,audience,"The movie captures the budding romance between two socially-inept, cynical outcasts who have long-viewed the world as grey, life as meaningless, and love as as irrational exercise in futility. This movie is not for everyone, but if you harbor a shred of cynicism along with an ability to use context clues or vast vocabulary, you will find an enjoyable yet different brand of rom-com here."
Destination Wedding,51,57,audience,"A very small-scale romantic comedy that avoids the tiresome tropes with scathing dialogue between two unlikable characters. Fortunately, Reeves and Ryder make the underwhelming and hollow premise entertaining enough to make the 86 minute runtime not feel like 186 minutes."
Destination Wedding,51,57,audience,"Good watch, could watch again, but can't honestly recommend.

This is a very odd movie.  It is literally Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder playing awful people (allegedly ""the worst"", as claimed by family).  Like, they're so ""bad"" that they openly talk around and away biological survival instincts.

I think if you like ""Clerks"" (or Kevin Smith movies), then you might actually like this.  It's definitely dialogue heavy with some interesting conversation.

The weird twist is that this is clearly intended as a romantic (non-) comedy, so there is a difficultly level in making these 2 particular characters interested in each other, let alone acting on it that I think both the writing and actors manage wonderfully.

I personally struggled with it, because if I sat on a plane with Winona Ryder acting like she does in this movie, I still would have been into her.  I'm honestly not sure if its because I think they actually make good points (which worries me about me) or I just find her that attractive.

There is a neat sociological perspective here, but it is almost all character interaction, between 2 characters, so I would completely understand if there is limited interest for this one."

Reeves and Ryder do their best, but for the most part this is an misanthropic exercise that becomes too grating to be worthy of much ceremony.

It's with the heaviest of hearts that I regretfully inform you of the sad fact that [this] ""not a rom-com"" rom-com starring Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder is not a good film.

Reeves and Ryder get miscast as brittle, misanthropic loners connecting during a dreaded wedding weekend. The film demands congratulations for having a vocabulary, but the nonstop jabber is merely time-filling, sub-Kevin Smith prattle.

As it stands, the best measure available to judge its appeal before watching is this: how much do you love Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves?

On-screen chemistry between two magnetic leads can overcome a lot in a film, but it can't mask questionable screenwriting.

A missed opportunity. The two leads are anchored by a script which skirts so close to being informed and interesting, but ends up like an overheard conversation between two people who should definitely not be together.

It is clunky, sophomoric, unconvincing, obvious, painful and dreadful and our erstwhile film stars gave this word vomit the delivery it deserved. Which is to say, terrible.

Destination Wedding is nothing if not wasted potential, weighed down by a script which fails to produce any spark on screen, underlined by an incongruously cheesy score.

 "
Destination Wedding,51,57,critic,"
While Reeves and Ryder have an undeniable charm, the film soon becomes very monotonous.

Nevertheless, Destination Wedding is an entertaining exercise in misanthropy that will delight those with no love for the average romantic comedy.

Destination Wedding,51,57,critic,"
This is, hands down, the most ridiculously overwritten film in the history of romcoms, possibly even of all movies.

A couple of scenes in Destination Wedding fall so calamitously flat I had the disconcerting sensation I was watching the film dubbed in a foreign language or for a spoofed internet meme.

Doña Quijote contra los nuevos molinos

Extracto

Inclasificable, original película islandesa sobre una quijotesca activista ambiental y una decisión que cambiará su vida, con ecos del cine de Kusturica y que combina admirablemente el relato intimista con el cine de acción.
Reseña
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

Reseña:

Halla (Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir) es una directora de coro islandesa cercana a los 50 y al mismo tiempo una solitaria activista ambiental que lleva adelante una serie de atentados para desalentar inversiones chinas en la contaminante industria local del aluminio. Pero una novedad que puede alterar radicalmente su vida privada entra en escena.

La película de Benedikt Erlingsson suma al carisma de su protagonista, varios rasgos de originalidad en su puesta en escena (que recuerda al cine de Kusturica), un humor seco (por momentos absurdo) típicamente nórdico, los hermosos paisajes islandeses (no como postal sino como marco necesario), una clara crítica a las industrias contaminantes y agudas reflexiones sobre el manejo de la agenda política y una lograda y curiosa integración de relato intimista con película de acción.

Halla es una mujer comprometida con su causa, quijotesca, que pone en juego su comodidad burguesa (con una importante demanda física para la actriz protagónica), frente a una encrucijada cuya resolución es conmovedora, en un filme con un desarrollo difícilmente previsible.

Doña Quixote against the new mills

Abstract

Unclassifiable, original Icelandic film about an quixotic environmental activist and a decision that will change her life, with echoes of Kusturica cinema, admirably combining intimate storytelling with action cinema.



………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………… ..



Review:

Halla (Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir) is an Icelandic choir director in her late fifties and at the same time a lonely environmental activist who carries out a series of attacks to discourage Chinese investment in the polluting local aluminum industry. But a novelty that can radically alter her private life enters the picture.

Benedikt Erlingsson's film adds to the charisma of its protagonist, various traits of originality in its staging (reminiscent of the Kusturica cinema), a dry humor (at times absurd) typically Nordic, the beautiful Icelandic landscapes (not as a postcard but as a necessary framework), a clear criticism of polluting industries and sharp reflections on the management of the political agenda and a successful and curious integration of an intimate story with an action film.

Halla is a woman committed to her cause, quixotic, who puts her bourgeois comfort at stake (with an important physical demand for the leading actress), faced with a crossroads whose resolution is moving, in a film with a development that is difficult to foresee.

Woman at War,97,88,audience,"Talk about white privilege! The woman is a domestic terrorist, but her family is still able to adopt a child. The musicians are creepy, very stalkerish. The best part of the movie is the Latino guy who keeps getting arrested while on vacation...that is the most believable part of the film."
Woman at War,97,88,audience,"Brilliant film - the storyline, the context (trying to protect the future for our children and our environment), actors, script, the sharp wit and dry humour, the music, the astute observations of our politicians and industry. 

I can't recommend this movie highly enough - one of the best I have seen and experienced. Long may women stay at war for the future generations."
Woman at War,97,88,audience,"Woman at War is a film about a woman who has taken on the role of eco-terrorist to try and fight increased industrialization in Iceland. The question is, can she fight for what she thinks is right, keep her identity hidden from the authorities, and live a normal life in the meantime? This movie was exhilarating in all the right ways. I was totally invested in her adventures, and always wondered if she would take things too far. When regular life comes into play, I was even more interested to see what she might do, since balancing life as an outlaw with domestic life could be impossible. I was totally intrigued by this character. She is likable, and feels like one of the most friendly women you could possibly meet, and yet she is also fiercely passionate about a cause and does what she can for the betterment of her country (without hurting anyone in the process.) One of the more quirky elements of Woman at War is something I’d rather not spoil for those who haven’t seen the film. However, it’s a fun way of breaking the fourth wall that I never saw coming. It made me laugh every time they went there, and added a unique element that sets this film apart from others I’ve seen. Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir is absolutely awesome in the lead role. She has to carry a great deal of this film on her own, and she manages to do it all and make it look easy. The tone of the film ranges from serious to silly, and that could throw some people off. Personally, I thought it worked remarkably well, and I enjoyed both the chuckles and the stress of our hero possibly being caught. It’s a movie that entertains you and makes a point all at the same time. I would highly recommend Woman at War to anyone looking for something off the beaten path. It’s a delightfully different kind of film."
Woman at War,97,88,audience,"Inspiring, clever, whimsical, quirky. A must watch."
Woman at War,97,88,audience,Gandhi and Mandela photo-frames in one living room! This movie is brilliant - it touches everything from obvious climate change to racism to government surveillance to war.
Woman at War,97,88,audience,"This is an intelligent, funny, intensely dramatic, captivating movie, with fantastic views of Iceland, and an extraordinary portrait of a woman who is torn between several deep-seated motivations and loyalties. It's fascinating, beautiful, action-packed, funny, and deeply moving. It's a film that I expect to think about and talk about for a long time."
Woman at War,97,88,audience,"It felt very politically correct; a fable for the woke crowd. Halla is clearly a hero in her head, just as any activist is, I suppose, but is she? Not to stretch this too far, but I'm sure suicide bombers consider themselves heroes as well. 

I'm an old guy, and our generation was taught that breaking the law in the cause of ""right"" was a good thing. Wouldn't it be cool if the German peasantry threw off the Nazi's, etc. etc. Yay Berkley! Yay Kent State! Yay civil disobedience! But is that true? Isn't that what legal systems were created for? To challenge authority and to right wrongs? It's much more fun, though, to sneak around and blow stuff up. No skin off your nose, and, as for the workers affected by your ""actions"", they shouldn't have been such exploitative minimum wage environmental profiteers in the first place. 

I know I'm coming off with a curmudgeonly ""damn kids, get off my lawn"" kind of vibe, but I'm seen one too many of these propaganda pieces, even when they're genuinely charming and funny. I've seen sufficient people standing in unemployment lines to fail to connect with a fairy-tale of the ill-informed taking the law into their own hands."
Woman at War,97,88,audience,"This was one of those films at you become one with. If that doesn't make sense, I apologize. It's hard to explain, sometimes a film can pull you in and make you really feel like you're part of the story.

I'm not going to say this is an amazing, groundbreaking film but it definitely was something different. It was smart and offers a compelling look at one woman's drive to save the environment and what it ultimately costs her... (maybe?)

I personally loved the music choice (and how they went about incorporating it into the movie. It was subtle yet fun at the same time!

Well deserving of a solid 3.5/5 gotta love those Icelandic/Ukrainian films!"

Hannah,82,62,audience,"The movie takes you into a deep reflexion of dealing with loneliness, lack of affection bonds, aging, lack of trust, feelings of rejection. Yet you are not able to take you eyes off of it. It urges some anxiety and desperation on you. Fantastic movie."
Hannah,82,62,audience,Absolutely heart wrenchinlgy beautiful! A must see
Hannah,82,62,audience,"Charlotte Rampling puts on a one-woman show in this drama depicting a woman's life since the imprisonment of her husband. While winning the Best Actress award at Venice, the film itself is a long and dreadful series of pretentious overacting resulting from the deliberate obscurity of the main issue from the audience, cutting off their ability to relate and sympathize with the protagonist. 

If you wanted to see an experienced actress in an acting class, this would be it. It pretty much contains so many exercises that one might call it an improv instructions manual. The subtle relief of not being judged by children - check, the embarrassment of being banned from a public swimming pool - check, the desperation of being rejected by ones own child - check, oh and of course, pretending to be in an acting class - several examples actually. While Rampling proves she can act anything, we never find out what she or her husband did that was so horrible. And so all these emotions become merely senseless fragments, unworthy of anyone's emotional investment, let alone appreciation."

It's a beguiling and opaque movie that doesn't quite provide the answers an audience needs to connect the dots.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
Hannah is a tough watch, but it's a fascinating experience to see this person slip slowly from her own life, sometimes because people shut her out, other times because she's afraid to test the waters and see how they react to her presence.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
[Andrea Pallaoro's] focus on the quotidian may wear you out before he finally lays down his cards and the depth of the protagonist's despair is revealed.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
The film's stripped down minimalism, paired with the subtle cinematography of Chayse Irvin, working on 35mm film, creates the perfect vehicle for Rampling's formidable craft.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
Probably one for hardcore Rampling fans only.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
Undoubtedly, though, Rampling is compelling: Hannah is impassive for much of the time, but we can tell she's weighed down by misery.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
Yet Rampling, ever the pro, kicks back against the material, occupying practically every frame, glowering and defiant.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
This is a film that doesn't attempt to seduce in the conventional way.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
Rampling elevates an otherwise fairly middling film.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
The script is minimal. It probably covers only a few pages. But the power is in Rampling's superb performance.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
It is a haunting portrait of emotional undeadness.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
It's a bit rum to make a sophisticated performer go through the motions in this way.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
Though too scrupulously enigmatic and reserved for its own good, it unfolds as a magnetic showcase for Rampling, whose powers of fine-tuned restraint and release sing out of every frame.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
Watching Rampling reveal Hannah's emotions is simply stunning.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
Rampling's performance is in itself a master class in the quietest kind of desperate turmoil, but other than further proof of her undeniable talent, there's not much else to be taken from this.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
A film as sparse as this only works as well as the performance leading it, and I'm glad to say Rampling remains in fine form.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
The plot therefore unfolds between the lines. Pallaoro creates a scenario and then removes it except for its impact on his lead's motivations.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
Achingly morose, Hannah is an arrhythmic piece of beautifully composed, carefully deliberated miserabilism.
 "
Hannah,82,62,critic,"
Pallaoro's Hannah is a another strong showing in the genre of Charlotte Ramping. [Full Review in Spanish]

Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,audience,"Great insight into a truly brilliant, beautiful and misunderstood woman."
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,audience,fascinating movie that gives insight into the tragic life of Hedy Lamarr. A real treat to watch.
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,audience,"Well made documentary about fascinating actress and inventor Hedy Lamarr. The film follows Lamarr's life from childhood in Austria, to her becoming an international sensation for her notorious nude scene in ""Ecstasy,"" to escaping Nazis and hiding the fact that she was jewish, to moving to America and becoming a major Hollywood star, and most interestingly her wanting to help the war effort by inventing a way for the Navy to wirelessly control torpedos without having their signals jammed by the enemy. It's this part of her life that I've always found the most fascinating. She was widely considered to be the most beautiful woman in the world, and I'm inclined to agree with that assessment, but she was so much more than just a pretty face. Unfortunately, because of her ravishing beauty, no one took her ideas seriously and they were dismissed by the military and went unused during the war. Lamarr was a tinkerer and a maker before there was such a thing. For a time she dated Howard Hughes, who set her up with a workshop and put his scientists and engineers at her disposal. She received a patent for her war effort invention (spread spectrum and frequency hopping) which was in fact later used by the US military around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, but Lamarr received no credit or monetary compensation for her contribution (she sadly failed to sue the government for copyright infringement within the legal time). The very same technological concepts she came up with were later used to to keep cell phone signals private as well as kept wireless internet and bluetooth signals from being hacked, but she never received any recognition or financial benefit for her ideas. As Lamarr got older, she began to see her Hollywood career fade and she became something of a recluse. It's not said in the film, but I've always held the theory that Lamarr had faded from the public consciousness because none of her movies have endured. She appeared alongside some major stars in her time (James Stewart, Judy Garland, William Powell, Lana Turner, Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert, Spencer Tracy, etc.) and made some entertaining films, but none of them would be considered classics. ""Algiers"" is likely her best film, but it's not a classic and not one that's well known outside of classic film lovers. I suppose this review ended less of a critique of this documentary and more of my own biography of Lamarr's life and my own thoughts on the actress/inventor. To this film in particular, it does a good job of telling her story, but what this documentary did better than others I've seen on Lamarr  is that is used newly discovered recordings of Lamarr, which allowed her to narrate her own story for the first time (there was an autobiography that was ghost written and made into a sensationalized and highly inaccurate account of her life that she disowned), so it's a real treat to hear her tell her own story to a great extent. Lamarr's was a brilliant and beautiful woman, who has wrongfully been largely forgotten, but hopefully this documentary and the renewed interest in highlighting female contributions to science will bring well earned recognition to Ms. Lamarr."
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,audience,Absolutely blown away!
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,audience,"This documentary shines in its intelligent presentation of a luminous person. I knew little of Hedy Lamarr beyond knowing some of  Hedy Lamarr's movies along with a brief bit of personal knowledge concerning her association with an invention used by the military. I knew little of this person. I incorrectly assumed the title of this documentary was strictly on concerning Hedy Lamarr's status as a movie star of mid-20th century. Bombshell details the life of a woman whose intellect did not permit her to suffer fools or their foolishness, whose ""hobby"" was staying home inventing things and was the most beautiful woman of her time. While this documentary has the usually amount of ""talking heads"" none over stayed his or her welcome. This documentary contains portions of World War 2 period history, the early movie industry in the U.S. along with actual technical data from Lamarr's part in an innovative concept called, Frequency Hopping. The director moves the scenes along quickly, but not rushed way. The soundtrack emphasizes not overpowering the story. More than just a life, this documentary details a large portion of history that should have much more awareness. After viewing Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,  I may the full meaning of the title. Frequency Hopping has exploded into all of our lives changing them forever"

 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
Athough a string of famous talking heads - from Mel Brooks to Diane Kruger - pop up here to celebrate Lamarr's remarkable achievements, the sense of wasted gifts gives director Alexandra Dean's film an underlying sadness.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
Bombshell suggests that Lamarr was largely wasted by the film industry, which could make little use of her personality and intellect. ""
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
Director Alexandra Dean gets the most out of a peculiar mix of on-camera interviews, archival footage and recently discovered audiotapes of Lamarr explaining herself posthumously.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
Not your usual silver-screen documentary.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
By coloring Lamarr's life story in with shades of gray rather than distilling it to the black and white of ""film star"" or ""inventor"" or the like, a full picture of the woman-inquisitive, talented, flawed-comes into focus.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
The documentary is informative and thoroughly engaging with its narrative fluidity.

A fascinating documentary about Hedy Lamarr, an extraordinary woman who was so much more than the moviegoing public ever imagined.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
A witty, fascinating and sometimes melancholic biography of a clever, complex and beautiful woman. It rattles along at an impressive pace, with a drive and verve of which inventor and Hollywood actress Hedy would surely have approved.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
This is a terrific introduction to a fascinating life.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
The film succeeds in the more basic sense by surveying a complicated woman's existence. It also does so without diminishing the intimate details that help audiences relate to Lamarr's complexity not just as an icon, but as a human being.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
This documentary of actress and inventor Hedy Lamarr is engaging and poignant, expanding the view (and our understanding) of the famously beautiful Hollywood star.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
With a central thesis unable to fully grapple with her beauty and her intelligence, it ultimately fails to fully create a narrative of a woman who was more than her beauty, and more than brains-despite-her-beauty.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
A recently discovered set of 1990 interview tapes with this amazing woman fills out a detailed and revealing portrait.

Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
It's a reminder that, even for world-famous icons, it's pointless to reduce people to a single piece of notoriety.

This film is packed with emotional kicks.
 "
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story,96,85,critic,"
The real tragedy against humanity uncovered by Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story is the millions of ideas that never came to light because society refused to listen to women.

The movie star who inspired Snow White's face had bad luck in Hollywood, but she was a drop-dead beauty who saved countless lives.

Amazing Grace,99,80,audience,Amazing vintage footage from the 1970s of a younger Aretha going back to her roots in a Baptist church to sing with family & friends present
Amazing Grace,99,80,audience,This is an insightful film into the talent and career path of one of the most talented singers of this era.
Amazing Grace,99,80,audience,Great documentary which amplifies the vocal power and talents of the Queen of Soul ⚓⚓
Amazing Grace,99,80,audience,I dig music biopics but there are so many better ones out there.
Amazing Grace,99,80,audience,"Smiles+ love+ admiration+ tears throughout the movie is my review. We have ""church"" in our own living room the entire time! Love it. 5-Star history for sure!!"
Amazing Grace,99,80,audience,It was a great musical experience.
Amazing Grace,99,80,audience,"It is a wonderful moment in history captured on film of an iconic singer at her best. If you love talented singers, gospel music and/or the queen of soul (Aretha) .... you are in for a treat. "
Amazing Grace,99,80,audience,Absolutely beautiful and moved me to tears.
Amazing Grace,99,80,audience,Recording of the spellbinding performance which transcends the pared back simplicity of the visual.
Amazing Grace,99,80,audience,"It's hard not to be overpowered by the 1972 documentary featuring Aretha Franklin singing a gospel album.  She's recording at the Reverend James Cleveland's church with his choir.  Sydney Pollack, who was just a young director, was originally calling the shots.  In 2010 and 2015 it was almost released, but it was blocked by Franklin.  Finally, after her death the movie was released.  It's immersive, and does what you're expecting.  If you don't like the singer (and how could you??), or can't stand Gospel music then this is one you should stay away from.  I shouldn't score these concert films, but this is about the best that can be done.  Final Score: 6.0/10"
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
The making of the biggest selling gospel album ever, reconstructed into an 89-minute film many years later. A great listen, a fascinating watch, though not entirely successful.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
So, was it worth the wait? But of course, and then some.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
Elliott and Buchanan follow [Franklin's] lead instead, framing the footage with a deft, almost invisible hand to make for 87 minutes that are teeming with life.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
With a beautiful resonance, Amazing Grace is a stunning tribute and celebration to the late singer.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
It's hard to see why this emotionally resonant movie ... was kept from the public for all these years.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
Aretha documentary has soaring music but no narration.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
People got up and danced in church. They could not help themselves. That's the power she has. In the movie, I think it was James Cleveland who said that Aretha can sing anything. There is no doubt about that.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
The result is a rough gem that will send your soul soaring.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
Great musicians, a great performance, and that's all you really need.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
The work as it stands now has considerable merit as a document recorded during a watershed period of the American civil rights movement. As a concert film, it's elevated by Franklin's powerhouse three-octave range and soulful phrasing.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
Amazing Grace is not a film you watch at home. You need to see this in a theater with commanding sound, a clear image on screen, and with an audience that isn't afraid to applaud and maybe shout out an ""Amen"" a time or twenty.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
The long-buried concert film is a tremendously powerful tribute to Aretha Franklin.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
This musical feast was filmed a very long time ago - but it feels like only yesterday.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
In Amazing Grace, Aretha Franklin transcends the blues by saying a little prayer - or singing one - for all of us.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
Here's a release that should prompt cries of ""Hallelujah!""
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
Amazing Grace is a deliberately unadorned film, and the raw footage that Pollack shot has an intimate, unguarded quality.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
This is a portrait of an artist at her peak and her most vulnerable, singing praise to the heavens.
 "
Amazing Grace,99,80,critic,"
It serves as a testament to one of the greatest singers our country has produced. It also honors the black churches that launched her -- and created the foundations of funk, soul and jazz.

What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,audience,Good to learn about Kael and the influence she has had on film.  Saw it on TCM.
What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,audience,"Here I am writing a review of a film reviewers life! Thumbnail re-cap - if you want to see a somewhat cerebral film that looks at the life of a renowned, yet snarky, NYC film critic - well ""What She Said"" is for you.

""What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael"" is one of those documentaries that is engaging to see how someone's life can be very interesting, even when not at the center of the field, in this instance filmmaking. Here we have film critic Pauline Kael and her impact and influence on film and film makers from the late 1960s until the beginning of the 1990s. While a warts and all re-caping of Kael's life, it does end up being more skewed to hagiography, some of it deserved for a woman who was breaking in to a gentlemen's domain. I will be honest, I've read few of Kael's reviews and none of her books. And while the movie covers a broad range of films during Kael's career, there is a particular emphasis on genres or directors she advocate for and towards the independent, artistic and offbeat. That is films from the 'artistic' circuit of NYC/LA/SF. Well, it comes off as one of those outsiders looking in type films - us as the viewer watching coastal elites, especially the NYC intelligentsia. One comes away a bit awestruck, a bit envious and definitely a sense of a rarified realm of the privileged - and the somewhat out of touch."
What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,audience,"A polarizing figure, Pauline Kael deserved a better documentary and maybe someday one will occur.  This is rudimentary and cursory for a women that so many feel was the greatest critic of all time.  Others view her as a mean-spirited shrew.  The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle! Final Score: 6.0/10"
What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,audience,One of my favorites must see I loved this one
What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,audience,"A good summary of Kael's life and opinions, which shows the impact that she had on film criticism and the film industry and tells the story of her life."
What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,audience,"This cinematic homage to one of film critcism's most influential -- and controversial -- representatives provides audiences with a passable overview of its subject, but it feels unsatisfyingly incomplete, never quite getting to the meat of the matter as effectively as it could have. We're provided with the requisite biography, interviews with knowledgeable commentators and narrated snippets of the critic's prose, but what's lacking is a meaningful, in-depth, organized discussion of the motivations and sensibilities that drove her work. Instead, we're given a scattershot buffet of passing observations, reminiscences of colleagues and those she wrote about, and  anecdotes about specific films that she either liked or disliked. Viewers come away from this offering never really grasping what drove her work and why, leaving a more than palpable and lingering sense of hunger, a disappointment given how significant a role she played in the field in which she became such a powerful influence."
What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,audience,Excellent film—insightful and energetic.
What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,audience,I loved it. A wonderful tribute to the greatest film critic of all time.

If it convinces one young moviegoer to pick up one of her books- or, better yet, interrogate their own relationship with film and film criticism- it will have done its job.

Would film critic Pauline Kael prevail today?
 "
What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,critic,"
What's most impressive about ""What She Said,"" which was written and directed by Rob Garver, is that it is, at times, nearly as critical of Kael as she was of those whose work she had no use for.
 "
What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,critic,"
If What She Said is clunky, however, it hardly matters. Kael's life and influence is worth preserving and celebrating; the movie achieves that goal.

Pauline Kael would probably have hated the Pauline Kael documentary, is what I'm saying. Hell, she almost certainly would have, and it would have been great.

Sit tight when the credits run and see just how many movies, great and not so great, she wrote about. The number, like Kael herself, is impressive.

It's exactly the kind of stuffy hagiography Pauline probably would have hated.
 "

Thankfully, ""What She Said"" is balanced on the subject of Kael's clout in the film and magazine industries, which could be as bruising as it was influential.
 "
What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,88,56,critic,"
What is missing from this undigested, too familiar information is a discerning, analytical assessment of Kael's guiding principles as opposed to descriptions of her often acerbic, caustic dismissal of any opinion but her own.

It may ultimately be an exercise in mild self-indulgence, but if ever there was a filmmaker who deserved to put a final cap on their career entirely on their own terms, it was Varda.

Varda by Agnès,98,86,critic,"
This final film acts as a perfect button to a legendary life in art, and it's also a launchpad to viewers who want to go back and explore her groundbreaking contributions to the cinema.

Photograph,79,65,audience,"The streets of Mumbai are the star attraction of this overly buttoned-down but well-made love story, and the scene-stealing grandma does her best to liven things up between the inert lead actors. Yet I still enjoyed it despite its lack of energy."

I cannot explain how it was both gentle and powerful. It took my breath away. I will watch it again."
Photograph,79,65,critic,"
Photograph is a slow-paced dramedy that can't quite transcend its setup. So, Batra ends up with a bland and meandering tale that is all foreplay and no climax.

[Ritesh Batra] imbues Photograph with an impressive stillness and realism.
 "
Photograph,79,65,critic,"
It's a likeable, tender story, in the manner of Batra's 2013 film The Lunchbox, but it withholds a lot from the audience without giving us something we're owed: a good reason for all that elusiveness.
 "
Photograph,79,65,critic,"
It's certainly engrossing, but perhaps too gentle to deliver much dramatic punch, until we reach an ending that asks us to consider how movies themselves can ingrain possibly unfulfillable longings in our daily lives.

This bland, sombre love story from the director of The Lunchbox (2013) lacks that film's flavour.

Who You Think I Am,82,79,audience,"After a truncated cinematic run earlier this year, French writer-director Safy Nebbou's film now lands on Netflix and is a must-see for Juliette Binoche fans. She plays Claire, a 50-years-old divorcee who after being unceremoniously dumped by a boyfriend who's young enough to be her son, she begins an online relationship with an equally young mate of her ex, using the photo and profile of a woman half her age. However, before you can say Poisson-Chat the film, it takes a few unexpected turns that pique your interests and by employing a variety of narrative devices to play out different scenarios, it mixes reality and fiction, perception and deception dextrously to explore a plethora of subjects ranging from social media to age and beauty and of course the loneliness of a more mature woman in Claire's position. The casting of Binoche is crucial as she is able to draw the audience and their sympathies onto her side, even when she is, at times, behaving in a borderline psychotic manner. Anyone else less visually appealing or, someone less vulnerable and/or more menacing (like, say, a Sharon Stone) and this film would have a completely different tone. Which is also what makes this an intriguing and provocative film worthy of your (lockdown) time despite a second half that turns more schlocky as it keeps trying to pull the rug out from under its audience's feet, down to its very last scene."
Who You Think I Am,82,79,audience,Sadly this movie didn't generate enough hype in 2019 but it is sure a great Thriller with an outstanding performance.m by Isabelle Hupert
Who You Think I Am,82,79,audience,"I saw the film on a flight, was not familiar with the title and watched because of Binoche. It's a FRENCH film, and doesn't disappoint. Very surprised by the ending."
Who You Think I Am,82,79,audience,"Very slow. A little frustrating to watch, but an interesting story"
Who You Think I Am,82,79,audience,"I went in knowing almost nothing about this film and came out really impressed. The plot is a little contrived but the strong performances overcame that. I loved the in-your-face cinematography. Nothing was hidden from inspection and the actors embraced the vulnerability. Every twitch was captured, Binoche and Garcia were outstanding. Definitely worth seeing."
Who You Think I Am,82,79,audience,"Another Oscar-worthy turn by the sublime Juliette Binoche tells the story of Parisian Claire Millaud, 50-something literature academic and recently divorced mother of two. Gradually pared back through pithy therapy sessions between Claire and her increasingly perturbed psychiatrist Dr Bormans (Nicole Garcia in a subtle, layered performance), the film's many twists, turns and narrative arcs, told through the eyes of the perpetrator, give it an exhilarating, if at times truth-stretching, take on what is essentially a story about the perils of catfishing.
 
In the wake of losing her husband to a much younger woman, Claire rebounds with a much younger man Ludo (Guillaume Gouix), who abruptly ends their dalliance with a cruel remark: ""Did you think you were going to introduce me to your sons? Come on, I'm young enough to be their brother!' Going into stalker mode, she invents a Facebook avatar to gain information about him through his Facebook friends. So Claire becomes Clara, a 24 year old blonde intern working in fashion (no eye rolls please), with photo and video credits courtesy of the social media profile of her wayward niece, Katia. Through Facebook Messenger, she lures Ludo's photographer best friend Alex (Francois Civil) into conversation, which quickly escalates into a full-blown cyber romance, replete with incessant messaging, missed calls and phone sex. Claire's passion for him reinvigorates her frayed emotions, but starts to intrude on her professional life as an academic and personal life as a mother of two teenage boys. 


Safy Nebbou's sensuous direction focuses the camera firmly on Binoche's photogenic face, magnifying every nuance of her expressions - a flickering eyelid, a wry smile, a teary pupil - that are a pleasure to behold. Claire's academic teachings of literary figures like the Marquise de Merteuil from Dangerous Liaisons reflects the unchanging insecurities that she, as a single woman in her 50s, feels in attempting to proclaim her sexuality in a world that has already discarded it. While it may seem incredulous that a woman as luminous as Claire would have trouble finding love as a 'cougar', it is this very fact that is judged and picked at by her friends and her psychiatrist - the harsh glare of society that seeks to put her in her place as a woman past her sexual used by date. When one of her male friends at a dinner party labels her as a cougar, a female friend retorts: 'so what is the male equivalent of a cougar? Oh right, it's called a man.' The revelation of the identity of Claire's ex-husband's younger lover during the latter stages of the film also makes us rethink the limits of propriety with regard to relationships between two consenting adults. 


As with all online romances, things come to a head when Alex insists on meeting, and Claire realises with increasing desperation that her act is up. But just when you think things are going to end badly, the story goes on a completely different tangent, and an alternative ï¿ 1/2~Sliding Doors' scenario is brought to life through an idealised romance between them in a long second act. Alex's sudden presence on screen, putting a face to the voice of their earlier conversations, thrusts the beauty and naivety of his youth into the foreground; but a curious hyper-reality occurs when Alex discovers Claire's duplicity and a shocking accident ensues. The final denouement, though, involves the reappearance of Ludo and the involvement of the enigmatic Dr Bormans, who breaks doctor-patient confidentiality and calls into question her own ethics in the whole sordid affair.

Worthy of special mention is Ibrahim Maaloud's evocative music score, which tenderly enhances Claire's internal conflict between her real and virtual worlds and backdrops the film's second and third acts with an impending sense of doom. 

In today's youth-obsessed world of social media where live feeds on Facebook and stories on ""Insta"" (a word which Claire has to Google) reign supreme, it is refreshing to see a film where a mature, layered woman, unsure of her place in this online space and society at large, takes centre stage. When Clara asks Alex why he likes her, he replies wryly that he finds her ï¿ 1/2~intriguante' - and indeed, it is the older Claire, brought to life vividly by Binoche, who is all the more intriguing."
Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
With a riveting performance by Juliette Binoche, it subtly addresses a commentary about lack of affection, identity on social media, and the midlife crisis of women. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
There's a kind of illicit thrill about watching Binoche dive so committedly into this woman's damage, drugged by the dopamine hits she gets from the little green light of Alex's active status.
 "
Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
We should be appalled by Claire's behaviour, but in a much darker, more adult take on hit Stan series Younger, Nebbou is smart enough to layer in a razor-sharp commentary on ageism and society's urge to make the older woman disappear.
 "
Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
It's impossible not to get sucked into the social media nightmare that unfolds, which is made all the more excruciating by the exceptional performances.

Who You Think I Am is a compelling thriller about identity, deceit and the dreadful impact human beings can have on each other when they're concealed behind an avatar.
 "

Profound French melodrama about catfishing; sexual content.
 "
Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
Too much more detail about the narrative would take me into spoiler territory, so let's just say that it builds nicely and, in this day and age, entirely credibly, and that Claire's sessions with a psychologist give the story a useful framework.

An interesting piece of work that strikes a particular chord at the moment.
 "

While Binoche is reliably magnetic and the fitfully pretty visuals match a ripped-from-the-headlines script, Who You Think I Am's pot never quite comes to the boil.
 "

Binoche gives another outstanding performance in this thrilling psychological drama.
 "
Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
It all adds up to a very modern drama about age-old anxieties: the fear of ageing and death; the desire for intimacy and reassurance; the allure of artifice and deceit.
 "
Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
Juliette Binoche lets us feel the fragility of her character, Claire, an academic terrified of losing her looks in middle age, but the storyline, in which she catfishes a young man, is simply too improbable.

I've seen it twice and it's even better the second time.

Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
But if all the red herrings fail to satisfy, Binoche going full Catfish is enough to reel us in. 
 "
Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
Not even the treasure that is Juliette Binoche can make this cynical romantic thriller palatable. Does not say the things about social media and the lives of older women that it thinks it does.
 "
Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
A sensitive portrait of a woman navigating the minefields of her romantic landscape, juggling fears of a ticking clock and the simple yearning to feel tethered to another.
 "
Who You Think I Am,82,79,critic,"
Takes a premise that could easily be adapted as a straight thriller and transforms it into a character drama of considerable empathy, albeit one that never excuses its protagonist.
 "

Binoche's performance and the movie are elegant, ingenious and sexy.
 "

The script gives the star the chance to explore all manner of messed-up ethics, but the legwork on screen is all Binoche's.

Lucia's Grace,43,,audience,"Beautifully acted, magnificently filmed, a joy to watch the landscapes and colors. The film is full of religious allegories, comedic yet profound. I will not soon forget the interactions and relationships in this film: mother and daughter, woman and lover, mother and madonna. Yes, it stretches the imagination and is loosely concocted perhaps - but beautifully so."
Lucia's Grace,43,,audience,I love this movie very very much
Lucia's Grace,43,,audience,"Despite the scene of overflowing is of a pure visionary power, and the restoration of the dialogue with the ex gives off real sincerity, too little grace: direction, protagonist and little story are good at most for the pilot of a TV series, as already happened to ""Non pensarci"".

A Colony,88,,audience,"This is a coming-of-age story about a girl named Mylia, and her bright, exuberant, and uninhibited younger sister Camille, and their parents, as they move to a rural part of the Quebec countryside outside of Montréal. It's much less flashy and in-your-face than other coming-of-age stories, and also has a somewhat subtle cultural undertone and a societal message which others may lack. It really is about society, like the film implies early on. 

Mylia gets caught between wanting to be accepted by the in-crowd, led by a girl named Jacinthe, which exposes her to a world of spiked drinks, premature and forced sexualization, and being inauthentic with herself, and in contrast, partaking in a more healthy relationship and life path with the blunt, yet very percieving, knowing, and understanding First Nations boy she sits next to in History class, Jimmy. 

Mylia wrestles with this new environment, these opposing forces and her growing feelings of friendship mixed with love and fondness for Jimmy, a boy from a Native American family who will never have any standing with the school leaders. His perceptiveness and gentle ways with little Camille are in sharp contrast to his outbursts of anger at the casual racism of his peers, which is painfully reflected in the history books they read in school. But he recognizes the introverted Mylia as a kindred spirit when he asks her if she was one of the kids who ""colored outside the lines."" In the conclusion of the film, he's also hinted to have appeared to become a more natural and healthy outlet for a sexual/romantic awakening for Mylia, rather than the one in Jacinthe's world which did not seem as natural or healthy.

Eventually, she follows that more earnest relationship she shares with Jimmy and her sister Camille, and becomes a more confident individual, set to become a better adult."

The bleak chill of the Quebecois winter seeps into the very bones of Denis Côté's latest film, giving a sense of aching longing to the action.

The gradual, matter-of-fact way that Côté transforms Ghost Town Anthology into an actual ghost story is quite impressive.

As this elegantly unnerving drama peels back the mundane veneer of life in Irénée-les-Neiges, it finds a disquiet that manifests itself in supernatural visitations.

The dead don't die in this subdued and eerily strange drama, but Ghost Town Anthology isn't a standard ghost story.

Ghost Town Anthology is an entrancing yet unsettling allegory that builds like the pressure of an approaching storm that never quite arrives.

Ghost Town Anthology might be Côté's best film yet, and I say this as a passionate fan. It's a stripped down horror flick that sends shivers to the bone like a winter chill on a February day.

Apollo 11,99,90,audience,"It was great to watch a documentary about the moon landing in an epic IMAX format. As a millennial I always took the moon landing for granted, even once believed it was fake. This film allowed me a glimpse into the magic and the logistical magnitude of this world changing cultural event, all wrapped in an explosive IMAX experience."
Apollo 11,99,90,audience,"At times, a thrilling visual treat, especially the footage that must have been archival 35mm converted  IMAX footage. I'm old enough to have watched live coverage on television. I was almost moved to tears reliving the experience."
Apollo 11,99,90,audience,What a treasure! A perfect and definitive encapsulation of this historic event that will undoubtedly serve as an educational tool from this point forward. The footage on the ground is absolutely stunning and I'm so upset that I missed seeing this in IMAX.
Apollo 11,99,90,audience,I thought it was an interesting look at the space program in the early 70's and how it captured the world to get to the moon and back along with the men & women who made it possible.
Apollo 11,99,90,audience,"Most historical documentaries seek to provide as much context as possible, to create an authoritative retrospective that takes into account content that no one individual at the actual time of the events in question would have in full measure - think the carefully constructed narration and varied viewpoints of Ken Burns. What Apollo 11 does instead, is to transport its viewers back to the event itself, to recreate the feelings of wonder, excitement, and stress that those involved in the Apollo 11 project and the global audience themselves felt in the heat of the moment, taking the extraordinary step of utilizing entirely period footage and dialogue, only adding in soundtrack accompaniment in sparing moments. What results is a highly entertaining and transformative rendition of one of the most remarkable events in human history, and an entirely unique take on modern documentary film. (4/5)"
Apollo 11,99,90,audience,"Original footage of the moon mission has been put together in this documentary movie, to show the moon landing mission with the original dialogues (only in english) and technical data about the speeds and position of the spacecraft."

As a testament to the wonders of science and space, it's extraordinary; as a testament to the triumph of cinema and mankind, it's more a small step than a giant leap.

Apollo 11 is vibrant, full of energy, and an absolutely essential telling of the momentous events, which are unveiled in a way that makes is all feel thrilling and alive.

Until now, the documentary 'For All Mankind' (1989) looked to be the definitive word on the 1969 moon landing, but this one easily tops it.

Zack Snyder's Justice League may be messy and excessive, but it's nevertheless a beguiling exercise in cinematic reclamation; for better and occasionally for worse, Snyder's movie got its soul back.

When all's said and done, like the Ultimate Edition of Dawn of Justice before it, Zack Snyder's Justice League is the far superior experience. It may be longer, but the additions make the story grander and profoundly deeper ...
 "

The extended cut is ultimately a setup for future films. And could arguably be said that it's just one 4-hour long commercial.
 "
Zack Snyder's Justice League,76,,critic,"
Zack Snyder's Justice League is a lesson in proper handling of a story, especially in terms of editing, pacing, character building, and even cinematography. It just feels more cohesive. And the 4 hour runtime only benefits it.

Kudos to Zack Snyder, who took this film and these beloved characters from the ashes to be re-born anew in this clearly superior new film.
 "
Zack Snyder's Justice League,76,,critic,"
If there's more to come Zack Snyder should be at the front of the universe so long as he wants to, as somewhere buried in all the excess here is a satisfyingly darker breed of superhero tales that's perfect counterprogramming to Marvel's family fun

Everything the Snyder faithful hoped it would be, and a vast improvement over its 2017 theatrical iteration.

It's difficult to imagine even the most ardent Snyder detractor failing to admit that this 4-hour (we'll get to that mammoth run-time in due course) cut improves on the original film in pretty much every way.
 "
Zack Snyder's Justice League,76,,critic,"
Even a good superhero flick (and this definitely isn't) shouldn't be this long.

A bigger, bolder and ultimately better Justice League, but the veneer wears thin, and after its torrid journey you may find yourself asking - was it all worth it?
 "
Zack Snyder's Justice League,76,,critic,"
...a bold artistic achievement: a comic book movie that feels like a foreign film, and a reach by director Zack Snyder to enter Terrence Malick territory at times.
 "
Zack Snyder's Justice League,76,,critic,"
The film is dragged out and redundant to a comical degree, but the much-improved action finale and the emphasis on Ray Fisher's Cyborg make it worth seeing and worth the fuss.

Promising Young Woman,90,87,audience,"An amazing film, well acted, and I loved the ending.  I was totally engaged and on the edge of my seat through the entire film, and it left me thinking long after it was over.  Carey Mulligan is brilliant, as are other members of the cast.  Well worth the price to stream."
Promising Young Woman,90,87,audience,"It is shot superbly and beautifully.  It radiates feminine energy and darkness in glorious pastels and candyfloss.  It looks soft.  It looks lovely.  It looks snuggly and Insta-perfect.  Cassie is like a stern primary school teacher giving immersive lessons on sexual assault to the boys.  And the girls.  This film is bloodless… yes, bloodless.  I've read a few reviews that seem to have been easily confused by the tomato sauce.  It's funny, colourful, dark and ultimately satisfying."
Promising Young Woman,90,87,audience,"We've seen a lot of revenge films before, but not one like this. Promising Young Woman goes strong on a very necessary and relevant commentary about rape culture, in this cathartic genre-bending thriller, with Carey Mulligan pulling off one of her fiercest, coolest, and most powerful performances. 

Call it the Thelma and Louise of the MeToo generation, this candy-colored (yeah, I'm still obsessed with the aesthetic) debut by director Emerald Fennell plays with music, colors, humor, and costumes too, where everything has a purpose and a reason to be. Won't say much of that knockout of an ending."
Promising Young Woman,90,87,audience,entertaining but very overrated...
Promising Young Woman,90,87,audience,Every cliche and caricature on full display here. Nothing new or original. We've seen this story done many times over the years and much better than this one.

Promising Young Woman feels intentional from start to finish, every line balanced for effect and many-layered meanings. It's messy in exactly the way it needs to be.

Carey Mulligan elevates Promising Young Woman into a feminist vigilante thriller.

It's entertaining, well performed and has a real twist of an ending. Just don't expect this revenge fantasy to have anything serious or insightful to say.
 "
Promising Young Woman,90,87,critic,"
A daring, audacious inversion of rape revenge films that incites outrage and courts controversy by flipping the script on ""good guys"". Mulligan is absolutely exquisite and the costuming and music is on point.

It's precisely the film's focus on the symptoms that make Promising Young Woman fall a little flat for me...

Promising Young Woman is powerful stuff and should be compulsory viewing.
 "
Promising Young Woman,90,87,critic,"
Writer-Director Emerald Fennell pulled off a magic trick so many artists attempt, she made a political film fun. It's only after the credits roll that the audience is left with the heartbreaking echos from the script.
 "
Promising Young Woman,90,87,critic,"
At every moment - and as channelled through Carey Mulligan's fierce lead performance - the brilliant and blistering Promising Young Woman vibrates with too much anger, energy and insight to merely be a copycat of something else.
 "
Promising Young Woman,90,87,critic,"
This aggressively provoking film is close enough to a traditional superhero / revenge film to feel like a much-needed corrective to the usual action thrill-ride
 "
Promising Young Woman,90,87,critic,"
It's as if the movie wants to provide the audience with the satisfaction of a successful revenge plot while robbing its main character of everything the quest for vengeance was meant to give her in the first place...

Promising Young Woman makes all of your favourite people terrible, but it's precisely because nobody's laughing now that it's so hard to look away.

Promising Young Woman delivers a promising start to Fennell's career behind the camera, as well as a reminder of Mulligan's ferocious on screen presence.
 "
Promising Young Woman,90,87,critic,"
Fennell's initial desire to subvert the patriarchy reveals itself to be misunderstanding the subject of sexual violence and rape culture.

Largely, if not wholly, a commentary on the #MeToo movement, Promising Young Woman is an entertaining and thought-provoking piece of filmmaking from Fennell.

The ending has a powerful kicker, and the deep sense of unease lasts long after the credits roll.
 "
Promising Young Woman,90,87,critic,"
Promising Young Woman wants to push buttons and provoke reactions. It's a scorching indictment wrapped in a sophisticated revenge fantasy.

Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,audience,"The movie was passable. The cg in some scenes were atrocious. I think what made this worse was the first wonder woman was fantastic with a little bit of cheese, but there is so so much more chesses. Weird actions that break the rules of the universe, character actions that don't match there past actions and soo much more. If your good with turning off your brain for a bit and enjoying some dumb action then you will probably like this movie."
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,audience,"The movie was fun to watch with my daughter but overall, the story was all over the place, it transitioned from certain scenes weird, and it was severely lacking the type of action you expect from a comic book film. Fun to watch the first time but I don't expect to give it another go."
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,audience,Not the best but I really like it
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,audience,If u love Wonder Woman (2017) then it MIGHT slightly Disappoint U. The plot is much predictable & some times it really bore you. If u have time & patience then watch it.
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,audience,"I feel compelled to save at least one person 2.5 hours of their time.  I love movies, but this could be one of the worst I've seen.  This is NOT an action movie.  It is 95% dialogue and 5% action.  In general, the dialogue scenes are bloated, taking 5 minutes when only 2 mins are necessary.  So much time spent using 200 words when only 10 and a little emotion (i.e. acting) is needed.  Bad story.  Bad acting.  Did I mention almost no action?  There is no pace to the movie and it would.. just... not... end.  I want my time back!!!"
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,audience,"Wonder Woman 1984, was so horrible it couldn’t be able to stand against its first film. Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman once again, and she plays it wonderful. I have no trouble with Gal. However, Kristen Wiig plays Cheetah. Which I didn’t enjoy nor care about. The plot was so confusing and stupid. What the hell was the point of the title 1984. The rest of the cast did an ok job. I am going to give Wonder Woman 1984 a: F"
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,audience,"This film's one of the reasons why cinema can't die. Throughout the whole movie, I just couldn't imagine myself watching it on my TV (no matter the video quality or the sound system you own), you just can't compare the experience cinema gives you.

I liked it, but (sadly) I wanted to like it more. Yes, it was very 80s' (and we love 80s'), and may I say it was even a bit too much at times (especially during the first sequence, which was kind of goofy and corny, but colorfully epic at the same time). Diana Prince robs Wonder Woman's on-screen time, which is not a bad think since we haven't explored that phase of hers in the past, and the well-crafted action sequences and a touching love story (that's still the film's biggest asset) will definitely make you have a good time. You'll see Kristen Wiig as fierce as a wild cat (although I wanted more of Cheetah) as you've never seen her before. Chris Pine is lovely as always (I want more of Steve, he can't be gone... again), and a well-developed villain in hands of Pedro Pascal. The aesthetics and visuals are everything, not to mention the exciting score.

I bet it'll definitely feel better on a second watch (as I did with the first Wonder Woman). If you have the chance of watching this, do it on the biggest screen possible, with all the safety guidelines I know you follow."

At least ""Justice League"" had at the decency to be short
 "
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,critic,"
Gadot is so skilled at bringing vulnerability to her battles - whether it's a physical fight with Maxwell Lord or an internal struggle about giving up the one thing she's ever desired. She embodies a true superhero, one who is inclusive and noble.
 "
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,critic,"
It is even more absurd than the first one that grossly distorted history. Gal Gadot's delivery makes Tony Curtis', ""Yonda Lies Da Castle of My Fodda,"" seem Shakespearean.
 "
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,critic,"
Wonder Woman 1984 doesn't spin the most complicated story, but it's so repetitive and meandering across its 151-minute running time that it's needlessly bulky, muddled and weighed down.
 "
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,critic,"
Feels like this would be better suited for an episode of TV than a 2.5 hour film.
 "
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,critic,"
There are plenty of good times to be had as we pick back up with Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman/Diana Prince six-plus decades after the World War I-set first tale.
 "
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,critic,"
While Wonder Woman 1984 still has a bit of the old magic, and its leads all turn in terrific performances, the film is hampered by a frequently nonsensical plot, extraneous showy action sequences, and it's way too heavy-handed with the moralizing.

Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,critic,"
I have sorely missed this sort of big budget popcorn flick through this never-ending pandemic and Wonder Woman succeeds in filling that gap, though only by the slimmest of margins.

WW84 is a near perfect superhero film that outshines the original with its infectious sense of joy and optimism and nuanced deconstruction of the power of truth and how that can be a tool of good or evil.
 "
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,critic,"
""Wonder Woman"" (2017) was one of the best superhero movies ever made. It was idealistic, classy, aesthetically pleasing, and romantic, and should've kicked off a fabulous franchise. Unfortunately the sequel is a major letdown.

Wonder Woman 1984 adequately fills the superhero pandemic gap, but it isn't wondrous.

Given the standing of 2017's Wonder Woman as one of the best superhero movies ever made (Top 15, for sure), there's no getting around the fact that the highly anticipated Wonder Woman 1984 registers as a massive disappointment.
 "
Wonder Woman 1984,59,74,critic,"
With its confused messaging, lifeless action, and stereotypes as antiquated as the year it's set in, this is a second installment that aims to expand a hero's universe, but looks and feels like a franchise on its last legs.

The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,audience,Pure non-sense with predictability. This film had more plot holes then my Swiss cheese. 
The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,audience,Vanessa hudgens was amazing in the movie and to see how different all three characters that see plays in the movie react to each other. Can't wait for the next movie
The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,audience,"I respect Vanessa Hudgens, but her accent for Margaret and Fiona is excruciatingly painful. I was also displeased at how poorly Prince Edward was treated the whole movie. Other than that, it's pretty entertaining and has good holiday vibes, though it's not all that Christmasy."
The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,audience,"The Princess Switch: Switched Again is a worse version of the original. Look, I can go on about how objectively bad it is. But I think most know that this will be bad going into it. The first one barely got 2 stars because of how simple and cheesy it was. This one is definitely cheesy, but overcomplicates things by adding a third Vanessa Hudgens. The film seems more focused on hijinks than heart. Overall, this was terrible (which should surprise no one). If you go for these kinds of movies I guess you’ll eat it up. But I hope they don’t milk this franchise with a third. "
The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,audience,"Rubbish.

Vanessa Hudgens remains terrific, but 'The Princess Switch: Switched Again' is disappointing in every other way. I enjoyed the first, but this is a let down. The plot is woeful, with the set-up and execution equally as bad. The new characters are lame, while what they do with the original lot is boring.

The new character is just annoying, not helped by how poorly they are written; as are the clichéd goons alongside, though noteworthy (for me) to see Ricky Norwood cast as one of them - Fatboy himself. iykyk. Elsewhere, the main bunch from the first film reprise their roles, with the exception of Alexa Adeosun as Olivia - which is a shame.

I admit this isn't anything utterly terrible, I didn't dislike it massively. I wanted a better follow-up though, this is a rather lacklustre attempt. A third film has already begun filming, I'll likely watch it either way but hopefully it's an improvement on this."
The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,audience,My head hurts from watching this
The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,audience,"The original Princess Switch was perfect so this wasn't going to top it. The only hope could be that it be at least good. It indeed lived down to my expectations. Still, it was better than much of the other offerings that Netflix is currently spewing out. You can never get enough Vanessa Hudgens. She lights up the screen and always brings a smile."
The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,audience,I didn't like the movie one bit. I didn't like the third vanessa that was added it was a little to much and her accent is still not the best. The plot was a little silly.
The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,audience,Such a beautiful movie! So close to my heart❣️❣️❣️✨🌃
The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,audience,Genially pleasant seemingly moderately budgeted Netflix movie with a winning Ms. Hudgens stretching credulity even of this genre; requires watching Part 1 first
The Princess Switch: Switched Again,58,35,critic,"
As with many a sequel, Switched Again doesn't feel as fresh as the first movie - and, if we're being serious for a second, there was nothing in the way of a true surprise to be found the first time around.

Hudgens' acting may leave some scratching their heads, but one can't deny she throws herself into these roles and has fun doing them. As a result, so does the viewer; and not in an 'it's so bad it's good' way, but in a genuinely enjoyable way.

Hudgens is delightful playing a vampy, evil character, which she hasn't gotten to do yet in this series.

The Boys in the Band,82,74,audience,"Even though I haven't seen the source material, The Boys in the Band brings to the table some good acting (especially from Michael Benjamin and Robin de Jesús), smooth editing, and a great script that will make you laugh, and think at the same time. It does feel extra campy and theatrical at times, but I guess that was the intention in the first place. It can feel kind of dated and full on the typical homosexual stereotypes, but I felt that in the end, these subjects (tolerance, friendship, self-love, acceptance) are still relevant to this day."
The Boys in the Band,82,74,audience,"I remember watching the original film years ago and dismissing it as a bunch of over-indulgent camp queens competing for the title of queen bitch, with a couple of additional characters added to provide some sort of balance.   This new version captures the original perfectly.  The only question remaining is:  why did anyone bother?  An examination of the gay closet circa. 1968.  There were far better gay related themes to explore, even back then."
The Boys in the Band,82,74,audience,"This is such an important story to tell when it's 2021 and we still don't talk about internalised homophobia nearly enough. It shows pretty well that, even if you've got an identity, a label of some sort, that makes you part of a community, that doesn't mean you're all the same people and think alike. Hate generates hate and that's portrayed with mastery by Michael's character (Parsons). It's an unpleasant conversation we still need to have - which proves that not much has changed since the 1960s."
The Boys in the Band,82,74,audience,"Very well done and worth watching.  I was surprised that there were no golden globes for this film.  The cast is outstanding, Particularly Matt Bomer (as the good looking and empathetic Donald) and Tuc Watkins (as Hank) and of course Zachry Quinto (as Harold).  Charlie Carver as the Cowboy who is supposed to be ""stupid""  has perhaps the most insightful and hilarious comebacks in the movie."
The Boys in the Band,82,74,audience,Totalmente desconfortável de assistir!
The Boys in the Band,82,74,audience,This movie didn't really have a storyline and the acting was very cheesy and cringey. I got bored
The Boys in the Band,82,74,audience,"The Boys in the Band is a revival worth visiting. A classic play 50 years ago has been adapted with style and integrity. First performed in New York in 1968 this is not just a story of gay men but one of friendship, politics and love. It was quite revolutionary at the time and still feels relevant years later. Michael is busy organising a 40th birthday party for his friend Harold. Harold is late to the party but his other close friends arrive and things start smoothly enough but soon go pear shaped. When Harold arrives and Michael suggests a game is when the night truly erupts. The game involves asking various guests to ring an old love and tell them they love them. Of course this does not go well, bringing chaos and tears to an already stormy night. This is a vibrant, rambunctious film that examines friendship and the gay man's place in the world. The cast is all gay and they do a great job, especially Jim Parsons and Zachary Quinto as the caustic Harold. A poignant film full of life and love."
The Boys in the Band,82,74,audience,"This drama directed by Joe Mantello and produced by Ryan Murphy, based on the 1968 play of the same name by Mart Crowley, is set at a birthday party in 1968 New York, in which a surprise guest and a drunken game leave seven gay friends reckoning with unspoken feelings and buried truths. The theatrical nature of the movie is quite evident and Jim Parsons as usual, offers an impeccable performance with long dialogues and intense emotions on screen. The play was definitely groundbreaking at the time and even though society has come a long way with regard to acceptance and tolerance, it is shocking to think that after 60 years, there is still some prejudice in our times."
The Boys in the Band,82,74,audience,"In no way do these ""gays"" understand what a late sixties homosexual was about at all. Check out William Friedkin's film  adaptation of the stageplay with the brilliant almost intact ensemble of actors from the Barr and Woodward production at the Theater de Lys at a time just before ""gay liberation"". Also, in what world did the production designer think Michael would live in that shoddily decorated apartment?"
The Boys in the Band,82,74,audience,"This doesn't even come close to the 1970 original. Also, Jim Parsons was a huge let down for me when you compare him to the actor in the original."

Not a movie in the traditional sense. However, Beyonce's long-form video released to help promote her new album ""Lemonade"" was just about the most intoxicating piece of cinema released in 2016.

Lemonade,100,93,critic,"
Technically, it is a visual album (her second, and the follow-up to 2013's Beyonc), though ""visual album"" is hardly an adequate description. Lemonade is a film - the most exciting film of 2016 so far.

The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion (Manyeo),88,88,audience,"THE WITCH SUBVERSION is a scifi superspy thriller with an emphasis on the 'super.' The slower paced first 66% of the film is a keen example of how skilled the run-away is at being a spy. She convincingly integrates into her adopted life, while at the same time we get good examples of how everyone likes her and wants to protect her, exactly how she expects they would. the film uses good juxtapositions of light, dark and color, and the action sequences are well handled.

Robbie's second turn as Harley Quinn is even better than her debut as the movie is centered around her and she's really able to shine and stretch out this character. You feel Robbie was born to play this character and you can tell she's having so much fun with the dialogue, her energy, and bringing this character to life. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about Ewan McGregor as Black Mask as I didn't know anything about the character heading in to this. Originally, I wasn't buying his take on the character (felt he was a little too lighthearted and not menacing enough). However, after pondering on it for a day or so, it's starting to grow on me.

 "
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,78,critic,"
If Robbie explores more films like this, she could have a legit future as an action superstar. (pub. date Feb 2020)
 "
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,78,critic,"
Quinn is simultaneously self-aware and oblivious, smart and ditzy, weak for a man and empowered by their split. The film rests on her dichotomy.
 "
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,78,critic,"
The director brings the kinetic and chaotic energy demanded by Quinn and delivers an action film that thumps.
 "
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,78,critic,"
Yan delivers above expectations. The action sequences are intricately staged with a continual surge of energy, movement and brutality.
 "
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,78,critic,"
This fantabulous emancipation is a feminist tour de force with strong performances, a visually daring design, and a lot of fun, butt-kicking action.
 "
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,78,critic,"
Birds of Prey is a balancing act that includes pizazz, a reignited love for Harley Quinn, and a thirst to see where new ones can go.
 "
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,78,critic,"
Let's get this out of the way upfront, first and foremost, and most importantly, Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is dump trucks full of fun. It's almost as much fun as a dozen Golden Lab puppies.
 "
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,78,critic,"
For a film that swings for the fences with its use of filmmaking techniques such as an animated opening sequence used to tell Harley's backstory, Birds of Prey is clearly a strong acting showcase.
 "
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,78,critic,"
This is not to say that Birds of Prey isn't fun. It's a wild ride! Darkly comic and colorful, and the action is engaging without being too over-the-top (you know how superhero movies can get).

Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,audience,"The official end of Phase 3 for the MCU went out with a bang. This is a very worthy follow-up to 2017's SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING. I really enjoyed Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Quentin Beck/Mysterio. His charisma oozes through every scene he's in. Zendaya is a good Mary Jane, but after 2 movies, I'm still unsure how I feel about her ""awkward"" take on the character. The movie is probably best served when Peter and Ned (Jacob Batalon) are bantering back-and-forth (or Peter and Happy for that matter). The movie clocks in at a little over 2 hours but it doesn't drag and the pacing and action keep you entertained throughout. Just as good, if not better than HOMECOMING."
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,audience,"Surprisingly good! Good dialogue and a great, subtle sense of humor."
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,audience,"Just awful. So, so awful

I would rather Spider-man never get another movie in my lifetime than suffer through another Iron man movie disguised as a Spider-man movie 

They only have one plot for this character. 

Villain who hates Tony steals Stark Tech and Peter has to get it back while whining that he doesn't want to save lives because he wants to hang with his friends and he is just a Friendly Neighborhood Spider-man"
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,audience,"Jake was a perfect casting! And Tom outdid himself, of course!"

Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,audience,"Very good movie. In my opinion, it is better than Homecoming. I think it was a great idea to take Spider-Man and put him in a totally different location."
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,audience,"undoubtedly the worst spiderman movie that ever existed, the main character has a very poor development just like the story."
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,audience,I really liked Spider Man: Far From Home. It was witty and funny and just a really good movie. I liked that it was in an entire different country which was interesting. I recommend it though.
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,audience,My favourite recent Spider-Man
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
After the near-perfect fun of Homecoming, Spider-Man: Far from Home is a big letdown. While still completely watchable for anyone who loves these types of movies, it makes for a less-than-satisfying experience overall.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
A movie that feels like part of the bigger Marvel universe but, somehow, retains its own character.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
Far From Home's sleight-of-hand pulls off effective and high-impact twists and turns, even when you see them coming.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
My Marvel fatigue was real going into a screening of 'Spider-Man: Far From Home.' Fortunately, it wore off early on.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
Oftentimes the laughs are so frequent (virtually everyone provides their own comic relief) that the action fails to make an impression.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
Superhero fatigue is definitely a factor here, as the film can't shake the expected narrative beats of these sorts of movies with the third act a rote exercise of mass mayhem and close calls.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
Spider-Man: Far From Home continues the feels from Endgame, and there are definite callbacks to moments int he MCU that, if you're invested, will get you emotional.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
Spider-Man: Far From Home is far from perfect (get what I did there), but relying on that overt Marvel confidence, it's a fitting epilogue to close out the series.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
This film has the best Spider-Man scene that has ever been filmed. It's not just visually stunning, but emotionally charged like no other. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
It would be wrong to write off Far From Home as a complete and utter failure, but it's certainly the most disappointing MCU film since Iron Man 2.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
eaps of fun, Spider-Man: Far From Home steps up the comic pace established by the Guardian of the Galaxy and Thor movies with bonus excruciating hormonal awkwardness, never more so than when Aunt May refers to his Spidey sense as ""Peter's tingle"".
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
A joyous trek through Europe after the gloom of Thanos and Endgame is exactly what the doctor ordered.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
A totally enjoyable ride with a commendably creative premise. ... In the big picture, ""Far From Home"" is the second best ""Spider-Man 2,"" better than Electro in 2014 but behind Doc Ock in 2004.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
Consistently engaging thanks to its blend of humour, action and humanity.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
Breezy and light-hearted with some epic action pieces, it's a visual kaleidoscope that will send 'Peter Tingles' down your spine.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
A standard superhero movie, but introduces a few new elements I haven't seen in a Spider-Man film and would like to see explored more.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
One of the most entertaining films in the MCU, even more so than Homecoming, which almost didn't seem possible until now.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
It never abandons the sense of humor, fun characters, and wonderful chemistry between Tom Holland and Zendaya, as well as correctly balancing adventure, romance, and action. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
Entertaining, goofy, and packed with strong action, ""Far From Home"" is a satisfying superhero adventure.
 "
Spider-Man: Far From Home,90,95,critic,"
You could chalk it up to Marvel fatigue, but we should call it like it is: it's just not as good as Homecoming, and a lackluster endcap to the stellar phase 3.

Toy Story 4,97,94,audience,"I don't know if my imagination has just slowed down since I was a child but boy oh boy was this hectic. The film leaped from scene to scene in dizzying action montages and excellent animation quality that put the originals to shame. Whilst I prefer the simplicity and character rather than action-led plot of the first films, this latest installment was a huge step-up in inclusivity and nuanced humour that I think everyone will enjoy."
Toy Story 4,97,94,audience,"Toy Story 4 is a seamless addition to the franchise, introducing us to new and exciting characters. The new characters, especially Forky, add another level of humor and entertainment that even as an adult I can enjoy. The only thing keeping me from rating 5-stars in my disliking of the separation of characters. What made the previous movies stand out is that they kept the gang together. Instead, Woody separates from the gang and interacts with a bunch of new toys, and reunites with Bo Peep. While it's interesting to see his character on his own, the lack of incorporation of the other characters diminished the overall film. However, the storyline is strong, the comedy is solid, and the voice acting is stellar as always. This is a must-watch for both new and returning fans!"
Toy Story 4,97,94,audience,"Creo que soy de las pocas personas a las que no les gustó mucho esta película, la animación es excelente y tiene nuevos personajes que resultan agradables y graciosos. Como película individual está bien pero como secuela deja mucho que desear ya que tira por la borda el mensaje principal que nos repitieron durante 3 películas, además que los personajes principales cambiaron por completo, ahora resulta que Buzz es tonto y no sabe liderar a un grupo además que ahora sufre de amnesia, toda la esencia de Woody desaparece por completo y ahora resulta que Betty siempre fue una feminista, mujer empoderada desde que estaba en el cuarto de Andy, si realmente hubiera sido así las tramas de la primera y segunda película hubiesen sido muy diferentes. No me molestaría si su cambio de personalidad hubiese sido por el paso del tiempo y sus vivencias pero no lo muestran así."
Toy Story 4,97,94,audience,"Not as good as Toy Story 3, but still sweet, laugh-out-loud funny, and, of course, great animation and music! I appreciated that the villain's storyline was fully explained and the resolution was authentic. The ventriloquist dummies are SO creepy, though!"
Toy Story 4,97,94,audience,"Ok, do the people at pixar have super powers? There is no way that a four film franchise can keep making good stuff. First they made a masterpiece, then made another, and another, and now this! I swear something fishy is going on."
Toy Story 4,97,94,audience,"Fantastic film that could have easily been a tired 4th film in the franchise. The voice actors at this point have become amazing, really having developed wonderful, believable characters. The theme of the film is light-hearted but meaningful, which lends itself to the fantastic screen-writing. Lots of fun and really enjoyable."
Toy Story 4,97,94,audience,"This movie might be the PERFECT 👌way to end a franchise. being absolutely hilarious and beautifully animated, This is a big improvement upon three films"
Toy Story 4,97,94,audience,"Toy Story 4 took a story that had a beautiful conclusion, a beautiful ending and spit on it for an extra grab at more money. This movie destroyed the progress so many of the characters we had come to love had made and made others caricatures of their former selves. The new characters didn't elicit any semblance of staying power and, while I loved how bada** Bo had become and I loved her story, I felt like the overall plot was messy and unlikeable. Forky was better than I thought he would be and prompted some amazing shorts but that was all I could take from this. In my opinion, Toy Story 4 is the weakest of all of the Toy Story movies."
Toy Story 4,97,94,audience,"Not as good as the third, but solid enough worth watching. A great franchise"
Toy Story 4,97,94,audience,It is fun and cool. Families around the world will love this. I don't like that Buzz was dumbed down.
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
Pixar's franchise heads into new territory with this funny, poignant, charming road trip about passing on the baton.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
It may not have truly needed to be made, but Toy Story 4 is just as good as any of the other films in the series and proves once again that Pixar is the undisputed master in the animation field.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
While I have to acknowledge that it isn't a particularly necessary movie, I also must say I'm so very glad they made it.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
What Pixar does so well is they take something familiar or, in this case, done thrice before, and make it fresh ... Toy Story 4 is a beautiful bookend to a story that holds a special place in the hearts of many.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
Although it's unusual for Pixar to continue a series for this long, if each new episode is going to remain this spectacular, keep them coming.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
Though the film covers much of the same ground from the three previous entries, there's still enough emotional gas in the tank to make this worth seeing.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
Toy Story 4 is more like an epilogue than a new chapter. A funny, moving, surreal epilogue filled with existential angst.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
I'm not crying. You're crying.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
Let's hope new renditions of Disney properties continue such correctives, and that genre revisionism will again be in service.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
Toy Story 4 proves there's still life in these toys in an emotionally heartfelt tale.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
One of the most admirable things about Toy Story 4 is its refusal to bow to the easy call of nostalgia.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
At least the end result is a fun jaunt. Anything past this would just tug its threads to a fray.
 "

If the ""Toy Story"" trilogy took us to infinity, the fourth installment just took us beyond. Here's hoping Woody hangs his hat here and goes out on top.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
It plays like a nice, warm, final hug before we all have to grow up and move on.
 "

Woody and co will make you heartily smile in the heartfelt and wholesome fourth outing.
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
Competently done, but is that all you expect from Toy Story?
 "
Toy Story 4,97,94,critic,"
It wastes none of its nearly two-hour screen time, packing the story with a lot of humanity and heart that guarantees once again that there are no dry eyes left once the credits roll.

A surprisingly fun and effective close to this venerable franchise.

Avengers: Endgame,94,90,audience,Another superheroes movie with no script. At least was more serious and jokes were not too forced.
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,audience,It was incredible you do not want to miss anything in this movie.  In loved every scene in it.  it made sense I loved the time travel scene or the final fight scene. It was really good.
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,audience,Amazing conclusion to all the heroes that have been around over the years. Very well executed and was worth the hype.
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,audience,Avengers Endgame is a very confusing and a frustrating way to end of the avengers saga. The plot holes in this movie are very noticeable and are maddening. Overall this movie is irritating to watch. This film does not compare to the excellents of Avengers infinity war from the year before.
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,audience,Expectacular under every point of view
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,audience,Definitely a very unsatisfying conclusion after Infinity War. The writing is all over the place and the comedy ruins it.
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,audience,"If you are a true Marvel fan, you'll like this movie without a question! Wakanda forever!"
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,audience,"The culmination of over 10 years and 20 films.

A truly epic and emotional farewell to one of the greatest movie franchises in history."

Avengers: Endgame,94,90,audience,FANTASTIC movie. Everything is sooo good with this movie!
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,critic,"
Avengers: Endgame is everything Marvel fans could want and more. It will be interesting to see how the MCU moves into the future after the events in the film, but woe be upon anyone who doubts their ability to adapt and succeed mightily.
 "
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,critic,"
I found Avengers: Endgame wonderfully satisfying.
 "

There are [Marvel] movies that have been just as entertaining and a lot smarter than this one.
 "
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,critic,"
Feels like the end of the old cycle, the beginning of a reset. Old favourites gone, passing the mantle to others before they go. We even see a poster that reads, ""Where do we go, now that they're all gone?""
 "
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,critic,"
The MCU is the ultimate long game, and Endgame feels like its glorious final lap.
 "
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,critic,"
Terms like masterpiece and game-changer are often thrown around a bit hastily, but not on this occasion.
 "
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,critic,"
The fight scenes, while chaotic and intermittently exhilarating, are unable to avoid repetition; such is the nature of invincible entities dueling other invincible entities.
 "

""Avengers: Endgame"" was a wonderful surprise, filling almost every minute (all 181 of them) with excitement, drama, humor, and visually interesting and entertaining intrigue.

What The Russo Brothers did here is take high expectations and blow them out of the water with an emotionally thrilling finale. Get ready to be moved!

The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience.

Neither the best nor the worst of times in the franchise, it's a bit like a sugar rush. Endgame delivers both epics highs and a following crash that leaves you feeling oddly empty.
 "
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,critic,"
It's that the movie itself is overblown and half-baked, and without the audience, it's something of a glorified in-joke.
 "
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,critic,"
If Infinity War wanted to blow you away, Endgame wants to punch you in the gut and leave you a speechless, quivering wreck.
 "
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,critic,"
The 22nd installment is a fittingly epic, three-hour finale that packs all of the fan service you could ever want, laced with somber tones and emotional payoffs that will cause even the genre's biggest detractors to shed a tear.
 "
Avengers: Endgame,94,90,critic,"
It's one of the funniest movies of the 20-plus in the franchise, but it's also the one that made me the most emotional. But more than anything, it left me satisfied and thrilled that I kept watching them through the years.

Hellboy,18,48,audience,"this is horrendous, the completely just forget what happens in the old movies and just  change it but keep some of the old thing s in there, it doesn't make sense  at all"
Hellboy,18,48,audience,"Yeah, literally terrible"
Hellboy,18,48,audience,"This is one of the first comic book movies that was practically a shot for shot of the comic, one of the funnest movies I've watched"
Hellboy,18,48,audience,"Hellboy is a fun franchise, David Harbour is a good performer, Neil Marshall and excellent director; this is just disappointing.  No where near as bad as some say, but not great.  Makes you just want Del Toro and Pearlman to wrap up their story."
Hellboy,18,48,audience,Terrible reboot. Should have let Del Torro finish off his movies. Those were great. This was garbage.
Hellboy,18,48,audience,"Terribile accozzaglia di battute tristi e personaggi senza senso; il tutto condito da una sceneggiatura imbarazzante e piena di buchi (veramente Hellboy è discendente di Re Artù).
Non si salva nulla."
Hellboy,18,48,audience,They should have just asked Chumlee from pawn stars to play the movie. Poorly executed very bad storyline. Mila did an exceptional job though aside from her everything else didn't make sense.
Hellboy,18,48,audience,"Relied more on blood and gore, rather than actual story and dialogue. David harbor's acting and the practical effects are all this movie had going for it."
Hellboy,18,48,audience,"It seemed to have less of a budget than the first two films. But it did well with what it had. The story seemed rushed, I suspect the producers put a lot of good stuff on the editors floor. The acting was better for some of the people than the first one. The one thing that stuck in my mind that truly bothered me was that they got rid of the Irish character or the Irish in the character for a black American to take the role, then made a big deal out of replacing a European for an Asian for an Asian role. I like the Asian for Asian but not the black for Irish. It makes no sense. Stick to the characters as they were meant to be. It just makes a better story."
Hellboy,18,48,audience,"Absolute disgrace to the original 2 films (which by the way are TOP CLASS). 

I know they were paying homage to the comic's but come on.... What a load of convoluted cgi nonsense. Is only good for smoking a massive joint and monging out at cgi action sequences (which we can do with most mediocre cgi films these days)... 

Is a shame because the cast selection was not the issue - Jovovich, Harbour, McShane -  the rest were completely forgettable I can't lie. 

Anyways, I hope they can pick this back up in a few years and make proper use of the MASSIVE POTENTIAL these arcs have 'cus 2019 was a big ol' failure boys sorry."

For every amusing grotesquerie, a computer animated sequence threatens to destroy the momentum - especially those that involve human faces badly layered onto CG bodies.

If you are not a fan of the character, stay away. You'll just be dazed and confused.

It swears like it's just learned the words and splatters gore everywhere as if it discovered the only crayons left in the box were differing shades of crimson.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
As a monster movie, the film is fantastic; as a comedy, it's hit and miss; and as an action experience, I thought it worked, as long as you don't mind getting a little blood on your shoes.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
What is this movie supposed to be about? That's not a rhetorical question - I'm actually asking, since Hellboy makes no sense whatsoever.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
How does this incarnation of Hellboy stack up to its predecessors? The short answer: They're completely separate beasts.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
Comparison's to del Toro's vividly imagined and gorgeously crafted films only highlights the sloppy editing, puzzling needle drops and thread bare CGI of this reboot. The fans deserved better.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
Neil Marshall's reboot sure isn't the character's best movie to date, but it's undeniably the most proudly insane adaptation of Mike Mignola's work that we've ever seen.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
The one thing Hellboy has going for it, is that it's never boring. Trainwrecks tend to hold your attention that way.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
[T]he whole piece is like its eponymous character - chaotic, senseless and without direction.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
Everything seemed forced -- certainly the language, the jokes, and especially the gore.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
Yeah, this is terrible.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
The dynamic between [Ian] McShane and [David] Harbour is the beating heart of this new Hellboy.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
The performances are flat, the music is this weird blend of copyrighted songs and generic rock music, and the story is written in a way that prioritizes lengthy redundant talking over providing something amusing for its audience. Hellboy is just boring.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
The pacing is far too quick, yet the movie's runtime comes in over two hours. Hellboy overcomplicates a fairly straightforward story in the process.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
It's a depressing testament to the superhero economy that there's already a reboot of the Hellboy, franchise.
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
If you like gory action shlock, you should give it a try!
 "
Hellboy,18,48,critic,"
Hellboy is a messy, awkwardly vulgar, macabre adventure that can't decide how campy to be, which is ultimately far more entertaining than many self-assured, boring blockbusters.

Shazam!,90,82,audience,"This is the worst DCEU movie ever ...
Villain of the movie is lack luster , 
Storyline is mediocre at best , 
The superhero of the movie is Cringe Personified...."

Shazam!,90,82,audience,"SHAZAM! was a lot of fun. I didn't know much about the character going in to the film. Really the only thing I knew was he had many of the same abilities as Superman, but this is definitely one of the better DC movies as of late. Unfortunately, at times they almost ""shove"" their heroes in your face as one character constantly wears a Superman backpack, has Batman/Superman memorabilia in his room, at toy stores you only see Batman/Superman figures. I understand DC is wanting to promote their own brand and isn't going to plug Marvel; however, DC does have more superheros than Batman and Superman. Back to the film, it's funny, light-hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously."
Shazam!,90,82,audience,A good kids movie. I think anyone over the age of 16 will find it kind of basic.
Shazam!,90,82,audience,Cutesy nonsense and not very interesting.  No Iron Man.
Shazam!,90,82,audience,"É um filme bem divertido porém, eu esperava um pouco mais do Shazam, queria ver mais sobre a extensão das seus poderes assim como a da família Shazam inteira também e o Billy  parece criança quando vira adulto e quando vira criança parece que vira adulto.

Shazam! is as fun as they get and could be an indication of great things to come for the DC Comics universe.

This movie is a stew of secondhand powers, middling special effects, horror, and sentiment... and it is charming.
 "

I write this with sincere and heartfelt endearment: with its family-friendly, family-centric storyline and simplistic-bordering-on-ridiculous origin story, Shazam! is easy-consumption entertainment at its finest.

The humorous innocence soon gives way to obligatory superhero tropes, such as destructive battles, complex rescues, and computer-animated monsters wreaking havoc.

Shazam! shines light into the newly reborn DC Extended Universe. This is definitely the way to go. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
Unencumbered by the need to set up future films, it's an idiosyncratic beast with a tone that's entirely its own.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
heart of Wonder Woman and the silliness of Aquaman's bad dad jokes plus the dark side of horror-meister David F. Sandberg (Annabelle: Creation) on directorial duties.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
The parts in Shazam! are generally at the mercy of their respective actors, but sometimes that doesn't quite tide the film over.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
Shazam! is not a brilliant film, but it's also way better than I was expecting.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
Shazam! may not change your world, but it wants little more than to put a smile on your face and a little voltage in your system.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
A popcorn frenzy, it has bundles of fun, entertainment and charm, it's a welcome way forward if you are suffering from Superhero fatigue.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
Shazam! operates much more along the lines of a comedy than what we are used to with modern day blockbusters.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
I'm very amused with DC's interpretation of the Monster Squad. I had a blast.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
""Shazam!"" is so saccharine and hollow, the emotion so manufactured and false, and the goofiness wears so thin so fast, it becomes insufferable and leaves a lingering bad taste.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
The movie is a little goofy, which adds to its people-pleasing charm.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
Shazam! is the wish fulfillment fantasy all comic book fans dream about while poring over the pages. It's not only what has made Shazam such an enduring character for eighty years, it's also what makes this film so much fun.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
It's an enjoyable, simple, somewhat trivial superhero movie, but deviant from pretensions and steeped in a grace with which I have spent a good time observing the occurrences of this peculiar superhero. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
It's an interesting departure for Swedish horror director David F. Sandberg (Annabelle: Creation, Lights Out), who proves he has more tricks up his sleeve than just things that go bump in the night.
 "
Shazam!,90,82,critic,"
Perhaps a case could be made that there is a good film waiting to burst out of Shazam! but no matter how many times you say the magic word, it never makes an appearance.

Captain Marvel,79,45,audience,Like the character. Didn't like the storyline.
Captain Marvel,79,45,audience,"I don't understand the negativity towards Captain Marvel, it's not one of the greatest Marvel films but it is a satisfying and solid beginning for the character.

I thought Brie Larson was great, looking forward to the sequel."
Captain Marvel,79,45,audience,"I love the character, I love the comics I read, and I really wanted to love this more than I did. It's a watchable movie but it's not the great cinematic introduction the character herself could have had."
Captain Marvel,79,45,audience,Too Dark to Watch on TV thanks to whoever produced this product!!!
Captain Marvel,79,45,audience,Was this movie supposed to carry the avengers franchise?  It was just a mess of horrible character and plot development.
Captain Marvel,79,45,audience,Capitã Marvel é uma tentativa fracassada da Marvel Studios em criar diversidade. Mas só conseguiu criar um filme forçado.
Captain Marvel,79,45,audience,The weakest marvel movie of the whole bunch. The main actress is bad and not relatable
Captain Marvel,79,45,audience,"CAPTAIN MARVEL was pretty meh and uneventful. Mid-tier Marvel movie and when comparing female superhero's, I actually give DC the advantage thus far with WONDER WOMAN over this. The 90's nostalgia was overdone and was trying too hard to be cool and retro. Soundtrack at times felt out of place."
Captain Marvel,79,45,audience,"Soulless and lifeless. Disappointing. 

The writers and directors had an amazing opportunity to showcase a bit of MCU backstory but they completely bungled it."
Captain Marvel,79,45,audience,"Great storyline! I love Brie Larson, too! My favorite part about this movie is that it focuses on emotional challenges while still including the classic Marvel action. Samuel L. Jackson, Jude Law and Lashana Lynch are GOLD!"
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
The chemistry between Larson and Lynch propels the last half of the movie; Lynch brings depth, love, and believability to Maria.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
This nonlinear narrative adds interest beyond your typical origin story, but it's quickly overwhelmed by the same shtick that's in all these movies-uncompelling action sequences, recycled villains and flat direction.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
The convoluted origin story mixed with the cluttered action sequences suck some of the air out of the theatre but their take on the superhero character as both an outsider and one of us is as refreshing as it is unusual.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
A Marvel staple is to keep the story light and entertaining, and Captain Marvel is on par with Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man in that respect.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
The production and release of Captain Marvel, the new science fiction superhero adventure from Marvel and Disney, has a number of remarkable features, but none of them involve the film's drama, action or characters.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
This is Marvel's most narratively ambitious movie ... and it's occasionally a little hard to follow. But I'll take that trade, given that it's showing us something new.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
Captain Marvel is the living embodiment of some of the MCU's worst tendencies, but still ends up being an enjoyable ride and a fine introduction for Carol Danvers.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
While I felt let down by the lack of action, I left the theater with far more to chew on. I felt vindicated too ... She personifies strength and courage, and she's a character our daughters should see represented on the big screen.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
... at some point you just wish the writers would ease up a bit and stop attempting to wring comedy out of each and every situation.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
[Captain Marvel] is a blast-- a rip roarin' thrill ride full of humor, heart and guilty-pleasure '90s nostalgia that flips the expectation of an origin story genre on its head.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
Despite the standalone nature of this film, the first 40 minutes or so are fairly rough in design, structuring, and visuals.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
This film pulls off the impressive feat of making an origin story interesting by upending the usual structure of these tales, throwing us headlong into the action with the title heroine and only then revealing how she became an intergalactic warrior.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
Captain Marvel may be a safe superhero origin film that provides expected action and humor... But regardless, it's still a satisfying entry in the MCU carried by an effortless star turn from Brie Larson.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
Captain Marvel is a good film that does great things for the Marvel Comics Universe.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
It's far from being the best MCU film, but it does a decent job on introducing on of the most powerful characters of that universe. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
Despite the notable limitations, Captain Marvel delightfully serves its purpose both as a final cornerstone in this epic-long saga but the inspiration gained from seeing a female superhero on screen.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
The stakes are far too small for what should be a momentous Marvel movie, and Larson doesn't get to kick anywhere near enough shape-shifting butt.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
If the emotion falls a little short, though, the movie soars with its comedy and action elements.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
The movie doesn't go far enough in any direction, grounding itself in a mildly entertaining but surprisingly passé center.
 "
Captain Marvel,79,45,critic,"
A film that plays it safe with familiar formula but is so entertainingly empowering that it will inspire girls everywhere.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,audience,"This is my least favorite kind of superhero movie: extremely okay. Aside from Mamoa's enjoyable performance, and a brief appearance from one of DC's coolest villains, the movie moves into generic blockbuster territory that ultimately makes it forgettable."
Aquaman,65,74,audience,Increíble actuaciones. Secuencia de accion.
Aquaman,65,74,audience,"This movie has some really great action sequences, CGI, and the costume design is near perfect. Jason Momoa is pretty likeable as Aquaman but unfortunately I think the movie suffers with some major pacing and writing problems. A lot of the dialogue is very exposition heavy, and I think it leads to some awkward line delivery that can take you out of the experience. However, once you manage to survive the onslaught of exposition dumb in the first 2 acts of the movie, the third act is pretty good and allows me to forgive some of the camp. Not necessarily one I would watch more than once but its fun."
Aquaman,65,74,audience,"James Wan's Aquaman is decent popcorn fun that is seriously elevated by Jason Momoa's charismatic brute of a superhero.

There's a scene where a bunch of sea-faring crusty bar flies want a selfie with him and he's initially snobbish and unenthused, but then a series of snapshots (similar to The Hangover end credit scenes) show him getting wasted with those same bunch of guys.

The dude is a handsome hunk of a human being, but I totally see him actually doing that in real life.

The effects vary in quality and the underwater dialogue scenes are cringeworthy, but there's a vibrancy to everything that makes those scenes less noticeable.

And the fact that they pretty much double down on the absurdity and campiness of the whole Atlantean mythology and its subsequent characters makes the movie as a whole easier to digest. Case in point:

Patrick Wilson as Orm: ""Call me... Ocean Master.""

At this point Gal Gadot and Jason Mamoa are the most charismatic and interesting characters in the DCEU so we need a cross-over movie made ASAP.

And get Taika Waititi to direct."
Aquaman,65,74,audience,"I'm shocked by how cheesy this film was. All the hype I thought it was going to be great. The dialogue was SO CORNY. Great actors who did not act so great probably because they're not used to bad scripts. Kidman? Her acting was some Uncorked or Gravitas no budget level. And seriously, the ""reveal"" the kid's eyes, permission to come aboard and the bad guy taking his mask off revealing his bad guy face, was so generic. If Jason M. wasn't in this flick it would be trash.
Animation was some Nickelodeon style BS."
Aquaman,65,74,audience,Get rid of Amber Heard
Aquaman,65,74,audience,Epic movie under the sea. Sequences like LOTR but exploring the mysteries of underwater
Aquaman,65,74,audience,"Good movie. Think they were overcompensating with the oversaturated colors and some forced humor, but otherwise a good start to the Aquaman franchise."
Aquaman,65,74,audience,"I loved it, I thought that Orm was an amazing villain with real motives that made him a villain but not really at the same time. The visuals were so good and the soundtrack was great, I worked at a movie theatre when this was playing and got to clean up while the credits were rolling and I loved the song. Loved the movie"
Aquaman,65,74,audience,"Aquaman was a severe disappointment. Not only was the movie painfully long, but the plot runs off in several different directions at once, creating several plot holes and resolving very little of the conflict they set up. Jason Momoa at least makes an interesting and goofy Aquaman, even though at times his level of dudebro energy is slightly intolerable. Mera's wig is laughably bad and though I appreciate the willingness to stick to the comic's aesthetics, the Kool-Aid color of her hair was often distracting and unnecessary."
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
Wan decorates every frame with eyeball entertainment that grasps the sublime and the silly of the ""Aquamen"" origin story.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
More style than substance, Aquaman is wonderful visually, but presents too much that we've seen before, often in the form of lazy writing.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
An all-out assault on the senses, Aquaman is an overstuffed superhero flick that doesn't take itself too seriously, but also has no clue as to when and how to rein things in.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
After a somewhat underwhelming introduction in Zack Snyder's Justice League, DC's aquatic hero Arthur Curry returns for his first solo big-screen outing in James Wan's Aquaman, and the results are... not good.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
Literally a fish out of water movie, 'Aquaman' is a fun and ridiculous underwater ride...
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
A shirtless Momoa, repeatedly striking a poster-worthy pose, simply isn't an effective way to generate an emotional investment.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
A finely made superhero movie that doesn't feel as relevant when being part of an extended universe. [Full review in Spanish].
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
Aquaman isn't quite a true dud, courtesy of cotton candy visuals that are least a lot of fun to watch.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
Epic, weird and comic booky. Aquaman revitalizes the DCEU in ways no one ever saw coming. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
We get but a glimpse of what Aquaman could've been oncewe plunge into Atlantis, but its world-building is all too passive, zipping past its most unique aspects.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
Comic-book fans will find it entertaining enough to stay afloat, non-fans will start drowning and the rest of us will be tired from treading water.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
So does it give you your money's worth? Yes, if you look at the brighter side of things.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
Aquaman is not great -- it's barely even good -- but it's a great deal of silly, preposterous, splashy fun, with a fascinating degree of world-building that is rarely seen outside of the Star Wars universe or higher-end animated films.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
This is a rip roaring, hilariously goofy movie that is nothing short of entertaining throughout its two and a half hour runtime.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
A Day-Glo, candy-colored, hallucinogenic seascape that resembles the cover of an epic adventure metal album from the '80s. And it's as fun and messy as that sounds.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
[T]hat the locales are announced via subtitle, often before the characters ... know where they are, evokes the levels and stages of an adventure game. [T]hat's what [it] is.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
Aquaman is not only a surprisingly fun adventure film, but it's also a huge leap forward for the flailing DCEU.
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
It gives me a feeling that I only find when I see the fishes in the fish tank or in the aquarium, where nothing relevant happens for two and a half eternally long hours and the fishes transform into disposable plastic characters. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
A glimmer of hope for the troubled DCU, Aquaman is a way better than a film about a superhero who talks to fishes has any right to be.

Aquaman,65,74,critic,"
It felt like eight different movies.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,audience,"All I've got to say is ""thats a copy!"" 🤣"
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,audience,"Me encantó, no esperaba mucho pero terminé fascinada con esta película."
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,audience,Different and creative. Loved it!
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,audience,"I can see why this is highly regarded, especially if you have a connection as a comic reader. Alas, I do not, but I still had a good time watching this.

It was cool seeing every department of the story come together, while the animation is definitely one of its big plus points - I enjoyed seeing it. The voice cast all do respectable jobs too. I have no issues with this film, to be honest. I just guess there isn't anything I love about it either.

Shameik Moore is good in the lead, while Jake Johnson supports competently in his role. Hailee Steinfeld, Nicolas Cage and Kathryn Hahn, as well as a few others, stick out too. Away from the already mentioned, I also like the music - having already known about ""Sunflower"".

Evidently it didn't connect to me, someone who has zero attachment to the source material, massively. That doesn't, though, change the fact that I did find enjoyment with 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' and I would certainly recommend it."
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,audience,"O filme é otimo, desde trama aos personagens e a forma como são apresentados durante o longa. As emoções e sentimentos dos personagens nos envolve, nos faz querer acompanhar cada segundo e quando acaba você fica querendo mais,"
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,audience,"Legitimately this movie is a benchmark for what animation is capable of. When you match the tone and story of your movie with the right kind of animation you can make something so unique and beautiful that it just blows people away. So much of animation is cookie-cutter these days that this movie was such a breath of fresh air visually. Additionally, this movie is everything the superhero genre wishes it could be. With the oversaturation of the MCU cluttering the genre to the point that nothing feels new or fun anymore, this movie proves there are still good stories to be told with superheroes."
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,audience,How could an animated Spider-Man film be this extraordinary?! I Literally don't know but it obviously proved that it could.
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,audience,It's the best Spider-Man movie since the first two Sam Rami films.
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,audience,"I love this story and these characters, but not the blurriness of the animation at times, even if I can respect what look they were going for."
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,audience,"By far the best Spiderman film ever made. The humor is witty, the voice performances are great, and the animation style captures the comic book characters perfectly. This is a must watch film and one of the best animated films in recent years."
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
I can't come up with enough superlatives to describe how much darn fun Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
A resoundingly successful experiment that will open countless doors to the weird, wonderful world of comic books.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Spectacular, amazing, astonishing - whatever Spidey-related adjective you choose, it'll fit.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
An audaciously, almost unbelievably alive piece of pop art made by people who really respect and understand the hope at the core of the superhero mythos.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Spider-Verse manages to tell a comic book origin tale, a heart-warming family tale and a grand-scale multiversal threat tale and nails all three perfectly. More please!
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
This is not only the best Spider-Man movie that has ever been made, but it ranks on the top of the very own superhero genre. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Universal in its approach by leaving a beaming smile across your face, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse beautifully reminds you why you love Spider-Man in the first place.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Into the Spider-Verse ends on a whimper, but at least there's still something under all those masks. And you know what? I liked what I saw beneath those big, webby eyes.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Major audience appeal both of the child and adult variety, it's a wondrous web-slinging caper.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
It's a progressive, inclusion-focused film with a central message letting us know that we can all accomplish amazing things if we set our minds to it.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Feels the most like a comic book than any other superhero movie to date, if for no other reason than it could only exist in a rendered space where a variety of animation styles could be brought together into a truly wild and electric journey.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
The best Spider-Man movie I've ever seen, period.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Believe the hype. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is both the best animated film of 2018 and the best Spider-Man film ever.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Spider-Verse is a fast-paced, fun and fresh take on an origin story we all know so well ... The animation is amazing, combining different techniques ... to create a whole new graphical style we really haven't seen up to this point.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Actually captures the sensation of getting absorbed in a comic book.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
A punk version of a story of which we've seen adaptations before. But never something as bold as this. [Full review in Spanish].
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
There's a perfect balance between humor and pathos, a regular stream of jokes occasionally intersected with moments of real heart.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Impossible shots coupled with a breezy screenplay make this the most fun superhero movie since Sam Raimi shot an upside down Toby Maguire kissing Kirsten Dunst.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
Combined with the fast-paced action sequences and an energetic soundtrack, the film is a heady cocktail of entertainment.
 "
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,97,93,critic,"
It's a literal and symbolic passing of the torch, easily the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2, and one of the best animated and superhero films of all time.

Venom,29,81,audience,Very entertained! Much better than some high-rated Disney movies lol
Venom,29,81,audience,"Good enough I've seen it more than once, what more has to be said than that?"
Venom,29,81,audience,"This move is pretty well constructed. The plot is great and it's filled with action. It definitely meets my expectation of one of spider-man's worst enemies ""Venom""."
Venom,29,81,audience,"In the comics, It was about the tragedy of Eddie and how he's being taken advantage of and manipulated by Venom for its personal gain. In the movie they just play buddy cop. It's a shame how a complex and cool character was used in such a poorly way."
Venom,29,81,audience,"O filme não é perfeito mas os persoangens faz voçe se apegar a trama e ao decorrer delas, o carisma dos protagonista é o que mais envolve o publico e faz do filme otimo pra assistir"
Venom,29,81,audience,"Yet another reason why to never pay attention to critic reviews.  I watched because the audience reviews were so good.  This movie was so Fun!  Tom Hardy was Amazing as Eddie Brock.  The character, Venom, was Amazing.  I Cannot Wait for the sequel!"
Venom,29,81,audience,"The plot is lackluster, but the action is okay (could've been helped by an R rating). Tom Hardy doesn't have a lot to work with but is fine given the circumstances. Venom is at times quite entertaining, but his motivation, which on paper is interesting enough, is not built up properly. Riz Ahmed also poses a very generic and boring villain. Riot is a little better but also lacks proper buildup. Venom and Eddie Brock are set up well for later films, but the road there is hardly worth revisiting."
Venom,29,81,audience,"Tom Hardy joins the Marvel Universe as Eddie Brock, gritty reporter based in San Francisco who gets inadvertently bonded with an alien symbiote which transforms him into Venom.  I hadn't heard anything good about this, however I didn't find it that bad. Sure it's not as great as most of the other Marvel offerings, but Hardy does a good job and is surrounded by great actors such as Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed."
Venom,29,81,audience,It wasnt a good movie but its fun especially  if you want to watch a dumb cheesey action movie to kill some time
Venom,29,81,audience,"I loved this movie. It had action, comedy, fantasy, science fiction. It was a super movie. Good lead actors."
Venom,29,81,critic,"
It feels unintentionally funny, as if all the actors except for Hardy understood they were acting in a generic comic book movie. He's a hoot, the movie isn't.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
This could be the most inane Marvel put on the screen.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
After the horror and comedy disperse, the film transitions into an action picture, full of flurries of CG tendrils and sludge.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
In the end, I'd avoid this film. It's a film without intent and carrying little enjoyment or entertainment factor.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
Has some fun set-pieces and worked around the lack of Spider-Man well, but the finale is disappointing and every character who isn't Brock is rather dull and one-dimensional.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
If you don't allow yourself to surrender to it all? You're going to hate Venom.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
Predictable and repeated story. Venom without Spider-Man is lame. The film relapses into the absurd and gives us 0 connection between Eddie Brock and Venom. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
[I]t all feels so constrained by its PG-13 rating, and with the anarchy appearing so anesthetized, it's up to Hardy to carry the picture to the finish line.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
Venom is basically The Mask with a slobbery tongue and none of Jim Carrey's slapstick charm.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
Venom feels like something Sony made so they could retain control over one of the few aspects of the Spider-verse they still owned. Without Spidey to anchor the storyline, though, it just feels adrift.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
It's worth focusing your attention on Tom Hardy's amazing, physical, and enthusiastic performance. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
I can't say I like Venom and I can't say I hate Venom, but I am glad I watched it. It's a bizarre slice of schlock insanity that's simultaneously the product of out-of-control interference by the studio and the singular dedication of Tom Hardy.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
I suppose one could say that about just about any bad movie, but Venom's energy and a couple of its performances elevate it above the worst of the worst... It's also a very bad movie, make no mistake.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
I didn't hate this movie... I had a fun time.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
A stupid, fun time.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
The film devotes way too much time to exposition (the first act feels like it goes on for about an hour), but once it gets going it's decent fun.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
I would like to watch more of Eddie and Venom bantering about their common character defects and possibly eating people.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
Above all, it's a poorly conceived script which hurts the film in the end.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
Tom Hardy gives it his all, but Venom falls short in almost every way. It has bad acting, bad pacing and editing, and a silly yet still somehow dull plot. It's another swing and a miss from Sony.
 "
Venom,29,81,critic,"
The final product looks like the result of a lot of last-minute reworking.
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,audience,"Not sure why this movie has high ratings, but it was very boring, flat and superficial. 
The only great thing about it was being able to see a variety of Asian actors and depictions of the culture. But the focus on the richness and looks was trite. Also, I did not laugh once, despite this being a romantic comedy. The humor was underdeveloped. The romance was underdeveloped. It was a very basic movie that took no chances and had no surprises. A better screenplay was definitely needed."
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,audience,"Excellent overall...cinematography, story line, characters, & great ending!"
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,audience,fairly mindless entertainment but enjoyable....
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,audience,Very funny.  Difficult at times to understand dialogue.
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,audience,"Lighthearted, enjoyable, gorgeous scenery"
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,audience,"Cinematography, interaction of the characters and story was exceptional...."
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,audience,"Apart from the extravagant sets and beautiful locations, the movie doesn't really have anything going for it. Its a common love story trope about an 'ordinary' girl falling in love with a secret billionaire with the only difference being the entirely Asian cast."
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,audience,Starts off worryingly superficial bling like with a lot of wealthy Asian expat in-jokes. It does ultimately progress to having a bit more charm as the plot develops into something predictable and cliché driven but still nicely done. And yeah of course there's the stereotypical camp Asian fashionista thrown in for good measure.
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,audience,"Constance Wu is infinitely more engaging and charismatic here than in 'Hustlers' - it doesn't even feel like the same actress. 'Asians' is a lavish, spirited, and just broad enough comedy that embraces how low-key ostracized one can be in adjusting as definitively American to a tightly-networked Singaporean family. I was hanging on every word Michelle Yeoh utters like it's gospel and that scene with Wu on the stairs - yowza.

Hearing the term ""banana"" for the first time when I've had ""oreo"" thrown my way before in life? I felt that. Though 'Asians' is comfortably structured by genre formula, that is outweighed by how genuinely the central conflicts are addressed (and resolved, mostly), the commitment of the charming ensemble, and the sheer joy of experiencing so many Asian actors in a mainstream film for a dumb ol' American like me. Bring on them sequels!"
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,audience,"Not everything clicked for me but on the whole, Crazy Rich Asians is a great romcom that not only takes a huge step forward towards screen representation but also, amidst the stellar acting and visually lovely production design, does a good job highlighting class differences, most prominently in a Mahjong scene in the climax. I'm not a big romcom fan but I do recommend checking this film out, even if you aren't Asian."
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
Crazy Rich Asians represents people and places with so little thought that it upholds a painful, brutal hegemony that's painfully apparent to people who live in Southeast Asia, where the film is actually set.
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
An escapist fantasy that entertains with its labyrinthine soap opera twists and turns, lush settings and all Asian cast but also digs a little deeper into the similarities and differences between the characters and cultures.
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
That soundtrack leaves one wondering ultimately for whom this film is made.
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
It is a fair bit better than whatever your idea of a generic rom-com is.
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
Buoyed by a stellar cast, Crazy Rich Asians rises above its rom-com center with a unique perspective on the Asian experience that is sure to resonate with its intended audience.

Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
[Crazy Rich Asians] represents a watershed moment in Hollywood, one that couldn't come at a more critical time as political forces seek to divide us, not unite us.

...the conflict comes from honest and organic places...
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
It's an uphill battle to complement the bland drama of culture clashes, foreign traditions, and elitist snobbery (it's terribly easy to despise the super rich).
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
It's the quintessential romantic comedy with a twist...

A successful culture clash rom-com carried by a three-dimensional star turn from Constance Wu.

Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
If this is the future of rom-com, consider me converted. I was so impressed by the overall film and would recommend it to anyone.
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
There are some pretty complex themes here, and they're wrapped up in bubbly Hollywood fare. That's mostly a good thing.
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
Crazy Rich Asians is a triumph on two fronts; both in it's diverse cast and it's beautiful storytelling.
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
Asian characters deserve a rom-com. Asian characters deserve to be in love! And with each other! If Asian viewers can see themselves portrayed in many different ways on screen, then they can believe that they can be many different things in real life.

Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
Crazy Rich Asians does end up falling for the same gimmicks we've seen before ... But as a cultural statement, it's a necessary move in the right direction.

Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
The jokes are so broad, the characterization so flat and the story so formulaic that I had a truly difficult time sustaining the excitement I feel that this film even exists.
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
It lived up to my expectations.
 "
Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
It was certainly a better movie than it was a book... This is exactly what I wanted.

Crazy Rich Asians,91,76,critic,"
...the heart of the film is Yeoh, who is finally getting her due...Eleanor could have easily been dismissed as a stereotypical villain, but Yeoh gives her great nuance, and her backstory demands we have empathy for her.

Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,audience,Great movie overall!! Very funny and awesome action scenes 👏
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,audience,Umm...WASP IS AMAZING! One of my favorite female superheroes! This is another great and funny movie.
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,audience,I liked this movie but it wasn't as good as some of it's successors. It was made well I just simply didn't like it as much as the others. It was still a really good movie though.
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,audience,"although it has some cool scenes and is still in a good mood, the script sometimes seems meaningless and without depth."
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,audience,Paul Rudd y Evangeline Lilly+Antman y Wasp= Diversión²
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,audience,"Just like the first Ant-Man movie, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a very fun, light-hearted movie with a lot of creative action scenes."
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,audience,"For better or worse, this is a Saturday morning cartoon made into a high budgeted, live action, summer blockbuster. It has all the laughs and gaffes you would assume from a Paul Rudd led film. But it also has your standard action set pieces and charismatic leads you've come to expect out of these types of movies. It also has Evangeline Lilly and you can never go wrong with casting Evangeline Lilly."
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,audience,It is a very good film extremely good theory of vibranium you would really like it
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,audience,adding wasp was perfect
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,audience,"A strong sequel. Perhaps not quite as good as Ant-Man, but it's a close call. Plus, the movie is essential to the plot line of the MCU."
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
It is complete nonsense ... but the great trick Ant-Man and The Wasp pulls is that it's really easy just to go along with it.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
With one notable exception, the entire film appears to be completely inconsequential to the rest of the MCU, which may leave some die-hard fans a little disappointed.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
Make no mistake, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a comedy before it's an action movie. But that doesn't mean the action isn't top notch.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
Not only do all of the antagonists provide their own comedy moments (even making light of a potentially daunting torture scene), but so too do all of the background parts.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
Did Marvel do it again? Yes. While not as kinetically moving as Winter Soldier or dramatically pleasing as Civil War, Ant Man and the Wasp gives audiences an extra scoop of ice cream in their escape from the summer heat.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
It's a light, screwball comedy that fully gives in to the ridiculous nature of its premise.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
The kind of film the summer movie season is made for.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
It might not be the most memorable Marvel movie, but is a fun family outing for July 4th weekend, not to mention a lighthearted reprieve from the gut punch of ""Infinity War"" (damn you, Thanos).
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
Returning director Peyton Reed has delivered a movie that pops with colour, silliness and the MCU's patented Big Quip Energy.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
[A] Saturday morning cartoon stretched out to feature length, for better and for worse.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
With a plot that at times is a bit wishy-washy, it's a sequel that appears to be a shrinking violet, a solid stand-alone that provides as much fun as its Marvel parent arms of the Universe.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
Ant-Man and the Wasp feels a bit like three underdeveloped stories playing all at the same time, none of them particularly tense or emotionally gripping
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
The Ant-Man movies are different entities from their MCU counterparts. These are the films that give us the human side of what's going on in this vast movie universe.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
I don't see the supposed entertainment, I am not excited by any scene, the characters are disposable, it is a childish one with a plot full of quantum gaps. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
Marvel's final film of 2018 will probably be something of a relief to many fans of its superhero movies, if for no other reason than it's a fairly straightforward action-comedy that hits far more often than it doesn't.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
The first coda is a beauty.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
Director Peyton Reed and his army of screenwriters haven't made ""Ant-Man And The Wasp"" a terribly clever movie, but it's clever enough to keep you from reaching for bug spray. And in the summer, Marvel has apparently decided that's all that's required.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
Like Ant-Man himself, wearing his heart on his sleeve, so earnest in wanting the best for those that he loves, Ant-Man and the Wasp just wants you to have a good time and leave a little happier than you came.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
Ant-Man and the Wasp is hilarious, fun, silly, self aware, and creative.
 "
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87,75,critic,"
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a welcome bit of formulaic fun, but it sits firmly in the middle to lower tier of the MCU.

Ocean's 8,69,45,audience,"my personal comfort film. no matter how many times i watch it, every time i enjoy it as much as i did the first. it's so fun and clever, and i genuinely don't think i'll ever tire of watching it"
Ocean's 8,69,45,audience,Woke anti male rubbish
Ocean's 8,69,45,audience,"I think people are taking this film too seriously. The concept is ridiculous and stupid, but the film is entertaining and the cast are fantastic. Not every sequel has to be overwhelmingly original to still be a fun and highly entertaining film. Hathaway is especially funny in the film. Would  recommend unless the offscreen death of Danny Ocean will deeply offend you (?)."
Ocean's 8,69,45,audience,"Tho it may be a little slow at times and some things dont always make sence, oceans 8 is a fun movie with lots of laughs and a great cast."
Ocean's 8,69,45,audience,"Great cast, fun story, overall an entertaining film"
Ocean's 8,69,45,audience,"‘Ocean's 8' fulfills as entertainment and its protagonists are very inspired by their roles, but it lacks something that defines it as an individual entity beyond its female cast"
Ocean's 8,69,45,audience,"This is such an AMAZING movie. I mean, to get the audience to fully cheer for the criminals is creative and clever. Unheard of, this storyline is a must watch. I absolutely love this movie. I have watched with 8 times already and I re watch with friends all the time. Great for all ages!  Amazing actors! Amazing acting! I would recommend to watch this for anyone. Even if you don't particularly like that it's all woman, it's still an amazing movie. It's so rare to see a cast of just woman! I just LOVE this movie!"
Ocean's 8,69,45,audience,"A poorer imitation of a poor imitation. 

A stunning cast fails to steal your attention in this transparent snoozefest of a caper. The biggest flaw, pretending this is somehow a female empowerment vehicle, women and jewels not cliche at all, right? 

On the plus side, Anne Hathaway is very entertaining."
Ocean's 8,69,45,audience,I loved it! I also loved that there's mainly women in the film. Usually it's the other way.
Ocean's 8,69,45,audience,Average at best. Some parts seemed dumb like how they where discussing the whole Heist plan in the middle of a subway while ordering. Would've been nice to know how Danny died or what was going on with all of that.  Would've given it a 3 star if there where more cameos from the old oceans cast like Damon or Pitt etc.
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
The star-studded cast delivered some great performances, but ultimately, the all-women team served up their heist with a side of marketplace feminism.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
This is all much less clever than Soderbergh's movies, less eager to wheedle audiences' expectations or stars' vanity.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
Jazzy, playful music sets the tone for inoffensive, flirtatious, lighthearted crime - the kind with no repercussions and little chance of tragedy.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
It may not be perfect but it's still a fun moviegoing experience featuring terrific, witty performances from its A-list cast.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
We feel that social bite as the gang explains why they're recruiting a woman for the job rather than a man: ""A him gets noticed. A her gets ignored."" In daily life, that's a tragedy, but when you're masterminding a heist, it's opportunistic gold.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
Ocean's 8 manages to fit itself within the Ocean's cannon while also standing on its own two feet. ... it's something worth celebrating with a martini, just like Debbie Ocean.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
Should Ocean's 8 be slickly typical or typically slick? It instead falls lickity split in the middle, a heist movie with half-baked ideas and not enough of its own agenda.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
In terms of structure and execution, it doesn't do much that we haven't seen before. But with this cast, the appeal is entirely within their chemistry.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
Ocean's 8 continues the Ocean's Series tradition of being a fun, slick and twisty heist film. Yet, there's a little something missing that keeps it from being nearly as fun, slick and twisty as its predecessors.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
The film tries to cover the logic gaps with comedy, but the jokes are so bad they somehow worsen the experience. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
The sparkling and in some cases, sizzling chemistry between the cast is definitely the main strength of this film. There is undeniable tension between Bullock and Blanchett especially.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
The pure joy of seeing this bold and thrilling film work so consistently makes it easy to overlook these minor shortcomings.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
The missed opportunity is what's frustrating the most. It could have been a fabulous movie.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
I thought the movie really missed the mark.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
Director Gary Ross (Seabiscuit, The Hunger Games), who wrote the story and collaborated with Olivia Milch on the screenplay, closely follows the Soderbergh formula of wry humor, nimble plotting, and wall-to-wall bass riffs.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
Steers ahead on charm and glamour, proving that an octet of women can do anything just as capable as an eleven-strong crew of men, if not more so
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
Director Gary Ross fundamentally lacks the Soderbergh snap that was on display in last year's Logan Lucky. But if you're just in it to look at some of the best actresses in the business pal around for a frothy summer treat, Ocean's 8 will do just fine.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
Ocean's 8 goes pretty deep without ever seeming like it's anything but popcorn fare.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
The devil is in the trying too hard. The other installments in the Ocean's franchise were a light mix of crime, glamour, and self-aware humor.
 "
Ocean's 8,69,45,critic,"
The glamor and swagger the ensemble cast brings to their roles is as memorable as any created by the Soderbergh crew.

Deadpool 2,84,85,audience,Wonderful. excellent acting from Ryan reynolds more cooler than deadpool I love it
Deadpool 2,84,85,audience,There were so many things about this that made it better than the first and so many things that made it worse. Enough so that I can't list them all here (and most of them revolve around Vanessa). Ryan Reynolds was born to be Deadpool and there is no one who can do Deadpool quite like him.
Deadpool 2,84,85,audience,"There’s a little bit of everything, but most importantly this film is funnier than the first. "
Deadpool 2,84,85,audience,"I personally loved Deadpool. It was a fresh take on the genre, but I loved Deadpool 2 even more. Bigger, louder, funnier, more of everything that made the first one great."
Deadpool 2,84,85,audience,"Unlike the first movie, this does not feel like it was made by people who wanted to create a movie featuring a character they love, it feels like a project to make money, with it's attempts at humour, copying what made the previous movie good with half of the charm."
Deadpool 2,84,85,audience,"I love the Deadpool movies!  I can't wait for a third one!  I cannot even Imagine Anyone Else playing the lead like Ryan Reynolds, he is AMAZINGLY HYSTERICAL!!"
Deadpool 2,84,85,audience,"Penis jokes are still funny, possibly funnier in this one. I still hate you Michele Obama!

P.S. Michele Obama is definitely a man."
Deadpool 2,84,85,audience,"The laughs keep piling up, as do the bodies In this solid sequel."
Deadpool 2,84,85,audience,"La película es divertida, pero más nada, la trama, no termina de convencer, los personajes se sienten muy forzados, y no le llega ni a los talones a la primera película"
Deadpool 2,84,85,audience,"I forgot to rate it, but I remember enjoying it."
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
The movie's progressivism is a touch paradoxical but inviting: a boys' club that wants everyone to join.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
It's all consistently funny, even if it's difficult to praise it for its originality.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
It's far from perfect, but works extremely well in its corner of the cinematic universe as the antidote to the run of the mill superhero entry.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
Like many sequels, it doesn't feel as fresh and original as the first only because we are now used to the character and what to expect. On the flip side, it's bolder, bigger, and definitely pushes the boundaries.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
A vastly more derivative film.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
In the first film, Deadpool scoffed and said, ""That sounds like a f***ing franchise."" Now, by becoming a franchise itself, Deadpool just sold out.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
I couldn't overlook the smugness that seemed to come from a certain corner of Reddit, and I couldn't give myself over to the anarchy because the anarchy felt all too calculated.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
Rather than skewering the superhero genre, it largely plays by the rules, and the result is a gripping action flick.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
Deadpool 2 works perfectly fine in giving fans what they expect coming off the success of the original.

 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
Deadpool 2 is just as irreverent and funny and violent and over-the-top as its predecessor.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
It maintains an adequate, agile rhythm, in which comedy and action are balanced to present, sometimes, ephemeral scenes that seek to portray a more personal chronicle of Deadpool, but that, equally, end up being satirized. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
For those who see every superhero film but fatigue has not set in, the Deadpool movies are exactly what you need to keep things fresh and different, unafraid to make fun of the very universe it occupies.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
Suffice it to say if you liked Deadpool, Deadpool 2 will likely be the funniest film you see all summer.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
'Deadpool 2' repeats the same meta-joke as the first 'Deadpool,' but, thankfully, the joke is still funny.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
But ultimately I found it frustrating: not quite the film it could and should have been, and too willing to punch down where punching up would serve it better.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
Deadpool 2 is so full of superhero movie in-jokes, one suspects it will be almost incomprehensible in a few years. But for now, this is the franchise we need to deflate all the franchises we probably don't.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
There are gleefully over-the-top fight sequences (often hyperviolent to suit the R rating), too many pop culture references to count, colourful and lovable characters and quips that come at you every second.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
Deadpool 2 is similar but superior to its predecessor. It is loaded with new characters for Reynolds to play with and brings out a different form (but possibly the best form) from director David Leitch.
 "
Deadpool 2,84,85,critic,"
Reynolds has never been better as he throws punches in all directions and his comedic skills are spot-on.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,audience,Really good.  I like the characters the plots and the fight scenes but there is one thing that bothers me and that is that they try to shove so many characters in one movie.  I am not even kidding there are over 70 characters.  It was still really good despite that though and I would recommend you watch it
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,audience,Bastante buena!! Recomenda para ver una y otra vez
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,audience,"Avengers infinity war is a shocking, exciting and a fun film overall. Marvel provides an action packed film with some comedy at the right times. This film really leaves you in shock and ready for the next film. Overall excellents from marvel from all around!"
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,audience,You HAVE to watch the movie its amazing
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,audience,"I saw Infinity War about 5 times in the theatres and it got better every time.

One of the greatest films of the past decade.

Seeing the Avengers and Guardians come together to fight off Thanos was so satisfying.

The Russo brothers killed it and created an exciting and visually stunning movie."
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,audience,"One of the best movies of the century. Some sloppy pacing at times throughout the movie, with some rushed scene CGI, but the story and acting are top notch. Marvel fan or not, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame are must see!"
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,audience,The culmination of a great run of movies. Amazing story

Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,audience,The action never skips a beat in this movie. Top this off with an excellent cast and jaw-dropping visuals and you've got a stellar addition to this wonderful franchise. It's easy for someone to get lost amidst the story but it's good fun nonetheless.
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
The dangling nature of the story will be frustrating to some. For fans, however, the movie should deliver in a big way.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
No genuine or long-lasting amusement or engagement is possible, as the reverential treatment of completely preposterous events and processes is what predominates.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
The Russo brothers deliver an epic, brutal, and oftentimes scattered showdown with the Mad Titan Thanos.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
Avengers: Infinity War is full of entertaining little parts that somehow do not make a compelling whole. It is a phantasmagoria of stunning action sequences and beautifully poignant moments that nevertheless leaves one cold in the end.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
There's nothing new about Marvel's money-raking formula, but as each new chapter comes along, the serialized story becomes more and more unwieldy.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
Josh Brolin does a fantastic job at bringing Thanos to life via motion capture without drowning under the motion capture. He's a brutal and unapologetic villain and is given an emotional backstory with Gamora that drives this story.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
Go see one of the best super-hero films ever made and see it on the biggest screen you can afford.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
Expect gasps at the haunting lack of closure. I dug the daring finale. It's every bit as entertaining as it is shocking and refreshing from a franchise that is predictable no more.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
For most parts, Avengers: Infinity War largely works and has a lot to offer and take in, but it's not without sacrificial trade-offs and mixed emotions.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
Whenever it needs a moment of escalation, it can crank up the score, deliver a big hero money shot and then just allow a decade of storytelling to do the leg-work.

More than any other Marvel movie in their ten-year history, this film carries a legitimate edge of peril most don't have.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
It's stuffed full of characters and plotlines and information, and it could've easily become a jumbled mess of over-stimulation. Yet the Russo Brothers ... keep everything moving, interesting and, most importantly, coherent.

Avengers: Infinity Wars, which may well be conceived as the MCU's new testament, the before and after, because, apparently, it starts with the formula to deviate in unsuspected directions. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
Infinity War marks a new level of storytelling maturation for the production company: it has gone beyond the laughs and even beyond the ideas - it has stripped the armour and produced the tears.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
A great deal of the movie works remarkably well and sets up a version of the unknown that this shared universe simply hasn't dealt with to this degree.
 "
Avengers: Infinity War,85,91,critic,"
Infinity War makes good on a decade of character development and plot to deliver a crushing gut punch that will have fans reeling until the second, currently unnamed entry hits theaters in a year.

They did a pretty good job.

Black Panther,96,79,audience,"overrated, not bored but...hmmm"
Black Panther,96,79,audience,"Com certeza um dos melhores filmes da Marvel , tirando um personagem desconhecido para uma história marcante ."
Black Panther,96,79,audience,"One of the most important Marvel films ever, a huge step in diversity and representation in Hollywood blockbusters.

Everything about this movie was superb...the acting, script and visuals all kicked ass.

Michael B. Jordan was a great villain.

RIP Chadwick Boseman."
Black Panther,96,79,audience,A real yawn fest. This is another addition to a cookie cutter copy paste genre that needs new ideas.
Black Panther,96,79,audience,"Doesn't live up to the hype. The story was childish and the acting was mediocre at best.
What I really don't get is the Rotten Tomato 96% rating."
Black Panther,96,79,audience,"This movie is so funny and exciting  for me. They have  a lot of top actors such as Chadwick Boseman, Michale B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and many more. This movies is one of my favorite movies. it's about the background of black panther and tell where is black panther came from. Synopsis of this movies is about Wakanda is looking for the new king. T'Challa (black panther) attended the tournament ceremony to select a king. Firstly,He won it but later Erik Killmonger have come to challenge to be a king and Erik have won. When Erik is a king, Wakanda has deteriorated conditions then it's time for T'challa to take the throne. This movie has a flowy story and makes me feel fun and exciting. Each actor plays really in their own role. The graphics and CG of this movie are absolutely stunning. This movie reflects society and teach many to viewers for example international political issues and teach everyone to realize social equality. Finally ,I would suggest this movie to everyone."
Black Panther,96,79,audience,Another hit for Marvel! Love this movie and Chadwick was absolutely amazing! The casting in this movie is perfection!
Black Panther,96,79,audience,"Let me sum up the 3 stars. You are supposed to be the most advanced civilization on planet earth yet you decide who your future king is by one on one death-match!?!?! The very thing, ironically, that drives the plot of the entire movie and undermines their whole system. Sorry, but this movie missed on so many levels. Do I love Boseman and his delightful sister Leticia White, emphatically yes. Should they have done more with the actual story, without a doubt!"
Black Panther,96,79,audience,Boring and tasteless movie.
Black Panther,96,79,audience,O melhor filme de personagem específico do MCU até o momento.
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Boseman's Black Panther is not only capable of fighting the bad guys but is also a vessel for the film's study of the importance of legacy and identity.

Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Sure,Black Panther is a mainstream superhero movie with jaw-dropping action, balletic fight scenes, and CGI spectacle, but it is also a measured and extraordinary exploration of race and pride.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
A taut triumph of Afrofuturist iconography realized in the propulsive, widescreen language of the superhero-blockbuster fantasy, and an elevation of that genre on every front.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Just about the same as every other Marvel title.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Here's the thing: you can enjoy Black Panther without having seen a single Marvel film beforehand. It is a stand-alone gem...
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
As the new king, T'Challa has to wrestle with a few issues that seem topical in today's society.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Brilliantly brought to life by the production design by Hannah Beachler and the costume design by Ruth E. Carter.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
You know there must be something special about a superhero movie, an action superhero movie at that, to get my mother to see that movie. And not just once.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
A dream come true! Near Perfection!
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Black Panther is likely Marvel's most politically inspired film to date.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Believe the hype: This is a superhero flick unlike any we've ever seen, crafted by the unstoppable Ryan Coogler.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Black Panther not only stands up as a Hollywood blockbuster but conveys an adult and chronological context that touches upon slavery, the Civil Rights movement, Black Lives Matter and the current African-American plight.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Coogler firmly sports his crown in blurring the lines between the cultural importance Black Panther is set to play in bringing down the dinosaur illusions of Hollywood.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
It's still somewhat overstuffed with an excess of characters and some undeniable hiccups in regards to pacing, but its filmmaking is slick, and the cast oozes charisma.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Black Panther is not just a superhero flick, it's a meaningful cultural hit that shows the power of diversity to tear down walls. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Does ""Black Panther"" occasionally fall into predictable superhero traps? Yes. But it also feels like the work of a filmmaker with a specific vision, one he more or less executes.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Groundbreaking? No doubt. An absolute unmitigated triumph? Time will tell, but from where I stand, not quite.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Black Panther is one of the best steps forward for the MCU in many ways: In story, characters, cinematography, its combination of score and music. Basically its whole package. It is one of the strongest and most inspiring films in the entire franchise.
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
It is not the best superhero movie that boast around so much, but it is one where you can have a good time. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Black Panther,96,79,critic,"
Black Panther may be long over due, but there was nothing about this film that didn't feel less than exactly what it should have or could have been.

Call Me by Your Name,94,86,audience,"With the exception of a few abrupt transitions which yanked me out of their world, this was a wonderful story that has stayed with me ever since I viewed it. I was oddly emotionally attached to it for many months so I read the book to get even more details and counted the days before I could get the Blu-ray  It deserved the Best picture Academy Award."
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,audience,"Acting is interstellar, plot is exceptional film locations are majestic the cast is undeniably talented"
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,audience,I don't have much to say about this movie other than a really enjoyed it. The acting was fantastic in this especially by Timothée Chalamet and Michael Stuhlbarg but that's to be expected at this point. This was just a down right feel good movie.
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,audience,"This film is very beautifully made. It's aesthetically pleasing and calming to watch. When it comes to the story of the movie, there's not much of a plot, but that doesn't ruin it at all."
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,audience,"All the scenes are so beautifully shot. To be honest, the performance or the story on the screen hasn't touched my heart as the original book did. Oliver is a little bit too old ."
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,audience,Absolutely greatest movie ever!
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,audience,"Call me by your name. Delivering a feeling of being a coming of age movie with intricate chapters, speech, metaphors of characters, music, art, paintings, sculptures and '80s. Can communicate deeply Together beautifully Causing romance with the relationships of two characters Another thing I like is to focus on love issues. Depicted in the sweet, secretly hurt of the first love. And Timothée Chalamet's performance with Armie Hammer that communicates seamlessly."

Call Me by Your Name,94,86,audience,A beautiful story of first love and discovery.
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,audience,"Liked the cinemotography, soundtrack, storytelling"
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
Chalamet is quickly becoming one of the most reliable young actors around...
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
The actors are superbly convincing.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
It's certainly a handsome piece of escapist-touristic fantasy, though I remain skeptical of Guadagnino, who often seems truer to his sideline as a luxury-product advertiser than he does to the narrative and psychological depth...
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
One of 2017's most engaging and loving films.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
[I]ncredibly seedy and oft-fetishized . . . In the world of Call Me by Your Name, this sort of behavior is literal, and it's abusive.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
Chalamet's performance is subtle but thorough, his body language conveys so many feelings... his stare is the reflection of the love he desires. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
[T]here is nothing else in their world of two, no other possible reference ... The film is powerful not in spite of the fact that it's a summer fling, but because of it.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
It frames the honesty of human feelings with a lucidity that transcends any sexual sphere. It is a good movie. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
Call Me by Your Name transcends because it dares to not only ask, but also answer the question posed by so many love stories throughout history: was the love worth the pain? Yes. Without a doubt, it was.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
A delicious boy-meets-boy romance.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
The director's use of location is almost too good to be true, and will likely make you want to book at trip to Italy immediately.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
I still enjoyed a lot of this movie.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
There wasn't nearly enough Italy porn or gay porn.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
A modern-day Visconti, Italian director Luca Guadagnino (I Am Love) grants us entry into a world not only of wealth but of culture, which can be just as liberating.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
Call Me By Your Name is one of the most beautiful films I saw in 2017, but ultimately it left me unsettled.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
The movie contributes little to the urgent contemporary project of diversifying representation... Yet, for two hours and change, Call Me By Your Name is an overwhelmingly pleasant and seductive place to live.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
The film (adapted by James Ivory) is beyond lovely and methodical, covering every aspect of the life of an adolescent at a critical moment of his growth.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
Guadagnino has absorbed some of that Merchant Ivory mojo, with its sotto vocce emotions and divine European languor. But he's also fallen victim to his inspiration's vices as well.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
A timeless and sumptuous tale of the rarity and fullness of love.
 "
Call Me by Your Name,94,86,critic,"
At its heart, Call Me By Your Name is bittersweet, melancholic yet ultimately uplifting - just like first love.
 "
Justice League,40,71,audience,"Joss Whedon's rework of Zack Snyder's Justice League should be a textbook example of how NOT to change the original director's vision. It's incoherent in it's style, themes & tone."
Justice League,40,71,audience,The lack of character development. The Tony Stark-like Bruce Wayne. The forgettable villain. I would say this movie can be enjoyable to watch. Few funny scenes and the Flash. Batman is too red. 6/10
Justice League,40,71,audience,Not well put together.
Justice League,40,71,audience,"Me gustó la película, pero las regrabaciones realmente arruinan la experiencia, no es una mala película, pero es inferior a lo que esperaba."
Justice League,40,71,audience,"WE DONT WANT MARVEL UNIVERS, WE WANT A FCK DARK REAL DC!!!"
Justice League,40,71,audience,"How in all that is holy could this disaster cost $300 million to make. How do you make CGI this awful with that kind of budget?

There is so much that is just wrong with this film that has been covered endlessly already so I'm going to pile-on to the God-awful effects critique (and it is NOT just Super Man's 'stache).

I honestly tried to re-watch this in prep for the Zach Snyder cut but I literally fell asleep about half-way through."
Justice League,40,71,audience,Just....terrible. We all know it's terrible because its replacement is coming soon.
Justice League,40,71,audience,Absolute garbage. Better avoid it.
Justice League,40,71,audience,I Wait for the Real Justice league
Justice League,40,71,audience,"Awesome movie!! Made me laugh, I loved the character chemistry. Story could have been better, but I had a blast!"
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
Cribs from Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Thor films so thoroughly that it's essentially a lesser MCU installment.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
There are promising tidbits here and there, but in the end, the iconic characters of the League deserve better.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
They are no match for the Avengers when it comes to entertaining us. The Marvel bunch fizz with energy and wit. This lot are far too dark and brooding to be much fun, and they spend ages hanging around before we get to the action.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
Made in part by Cruel & Unusual Films - an irony that might be lost on the production company.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
It's entertaining, fun and will make you laugh a bit. Just don't go in expecting something amazing. You'll be disappointed.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
I'm not even sure it's an actual movie. It's a two-hour trailer with some okay visuals and some decent sound design.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
[The DCEU] movies have to remember they're based off comic books, so there should be a sense of fun, because that's also what brings the excitement. It's an exponential entertainment equation: More fun equals more exciting.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
Clunky and messy, jumbled and misshapen, ""Justice League"" is also kind of goofy fun.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
It is a film with a faulty assembly, as boring and exhausting as the predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
The movie is definitely a mixed bag and while Justice League tries its best to pull off the finished product, it doesn't quite land.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
Would it surprise you to learn that I thought Gal Gadot's return as Wonder Woman is among the strongest elements in this fairly crowded affair?
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
This movie is awful, but I had a really fun time watching it.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
I laughed at this movie and with this movie.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
Justice League left me so enamored with the whole team that I'm ready and waiting for all of their solo adventures.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
It sometimes feels a little clunky, and the pacing often feels a bit too rushed. But when Justice League works, it's fast, fun, and funny.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
I can't defend the film on its inconsistencies but I was personally never bored, and the characterisations all shine through thanks to inventive casting and their shared natural chemistry.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
Overdoing it with CGI is not the right approach, let alone using the proverbial death ray in the sky.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
Justice League is not a film. It's a clip show.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
Justice League is an epic ensemble of heroes. It's the most fun you'll have with Batman and his super friends, until their next adventure together, and marks the beginning of a brand new era of superheroes on the DC side of the spectrum.
 "
Justice League,40,71,critic,"
If Justice League has an underlining tone, then it's mono and predictable.

Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,audience,What the actually fuck is this shit. Pure jokes without any sense.
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,audience,"The most fun film of the ""Phase Three"" Marvel movies. It's an easy watch that can stand alone from the MCU. 

My only problem with this film was the over the top humour, felt forced at times."
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,audience,"This is what Thor should have been all along. It was a funny, furious ride the entire time with delicious eye-candy. It was everything a Marvel fan (who actually likes these characters) could have wanted from a Thor movie.

Hate to say it, the movies are better without Jane Foster."
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,audience,Marvel's formulaic approach ruins this franchise. Joke after joke with nothing taken serious. Can't tell any of these movies apart anymore.
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,audience,Top 5 MCU movie easily. Best thor stand-alone film with the perfect mix of action and comedy. Great way to revive the thor franchise.
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,audience,One of my top 5 MCU movies! This is the best Thor movie!
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,audience,By far the best in the Thor series. Made spectacular by a wonderful cast of supporting characters. 
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,audience,"This is the one of the best marvel movies. Taika is extremely funny, and really reshapes Thor, who in the past was a bit boring. I'm HERE for this himbo getting the respect he deserves. Could it have used more Loki? Well, yeah, but this is the movie that got me into marvel, so I'm not mad."
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,audience,One of the best marvel stand alones 
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,audience,I liked this movie but it was a bit unnecessary. I liked it but I didn't really like some of the characters though.
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
All the drama, romance, and mythological storytelling has been dropped for one major component: humor.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Marvel's comedic approach to Thor delivers on all accounts.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Thank goodness for the idiosyncratic visions of director Taika Waititi who does a complete 180 on the first two films by making Thor: Ragnarok into a superhero comedy.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Witty, action-heavy, and beautiful to look at, Thor: Ragnarok is another clear winner for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
The first time that Hemsworth has really lived into the fullness of Thor's potential.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Finally a live adaptation of Thor that's actually worth your time!
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
irected by New Zealand's Taika Waititi, it's the daftest movie from the comic book studio to date, shot through with the anarchically quirky humour in Waititi's films like What We Do in the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Boy.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
It's when the second half of Ragnarok falls into the motions that it begins to lose its shine.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Instead of playing Thor as a Shakespearean persona, Waititi allows Hemsworth to use his natural wit and comedic timing to really bring the character to life.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Thor: Ragnarok is a prime example of how a complete tonal shift can rejuvenate a film series.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Thor is a character that keeps us guessing, and honestly, I can't wait to see what he does next.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Waititi puts you right in the middle of a crazy, fantasy world to take an acid trip of pure fun, action, while accompanied by kick-ass characters. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
That skyward in-the-moment shot is the only one that really involved me in the film as an experience and not just a sequence of moving images.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Waititi has made the third movie of the famed god of thunder the funniest in the franchise. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Despite a few minor issues with pacing in the middle, this is a tremendous step in the right direction for both the Thor franchise specifically and Marvel movies in general.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
A fun Marvel movie.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Taika Waititi's irreverent humor makes this film delightful with a tongue in cheek tone.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
These films will only improve by giving a diverse group of filmmakers room to let their creative vision flourish, and their characters stumble.
 "
Thor: Ragnarok,93,87,critic,"
Ultimately, I feel confident in saying that you'll thoroughly enjoy Thor: Ragnarok. This is precision-engineered entertainment that wants you to have fun...

Despicable Me 3,58,53,audience,We had seen seen this one before but we watched it again because my grandson was dying to get out of the house. And it was only 5 dollars
Despicable Me 3,58,53,audience,Unpredictably good. Love it.
Despicable Me 3,58,53,audience,love this movie! miranda cosgrove was great in it!
Despicable Me 3,58,53,audience,"This is so underrated. Like why is it hated? I love that Gru has (spoiler alert) a twin brother. I'm sorry I warned you. Oh, you have already watched it? Well good because this is a good film!"
Despicable Me 3,58,53,audience,This sequel is unpleasant. I hope Universal gets better making movies.
Despicable Me 3,58,53,audience,"The villain was entertaining, and Gru/Dru's charisma was excellent. But there are gaping holes and far too much corniness and attempts at seriousness."
Despicable Me 3,58,53,audience,I enjoyed watching it and the animation is top key as usual Despicable Me 3 is far better than Minions but it still doesn't manage to capture the Magic of the first two films
Despicable Me 3,58,53,audience,"This movie had a potentially fantastic villain, which could have provided many great plot points and lines. Instead, it focuses on the relationship between Gru and his extremely annoying brother. Very disappointing."
Despicable Me 3,58,53,audience,The best in the franchise so far.
Despicable Me 3,58,53,audience,Minions 2 :And A Bald Guy
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Raises a smile when it is in silly mode but is less successful when it defaults to being a capital 'F' family film, which is far too often.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
It's the spectacle of the gibberish-spouting Minions performing an inimitable version of 'I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General', the famous patter song from The Pirates of Penzance, that gives the greatest pleasure.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Fortunately, the Minions are used in proper doses to break up the slower, less interesting digressions.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
The minions are back up to their old tricks. They are cute in small doses and they don't overstay their welcome in this movie.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Retaining enough of the heart and humor to keep us satisfied.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Despicable Me 3 isn't going to win any awards, but it's frenetic energy and dedication to adult-level silly is admirable, so much so that it's easily the best of the bunch.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Despicable Me 3 has a lot going for it yet, somehow, it just doesn't have the same feel as the first two films and drags a little.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Too many storylines, not enough Minions.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
The cinematic equivalent of a movie jingling its keys...It's assuming that kids don't have an attention span beyond three-ish minutes.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
The family element, which was the central theme of the first two, is not captured as well here.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
It's nothing special, but it's not awful.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Pretty decent sequel that delivers and doesn't deny the fact that maybe it depends too much on the now independent 'minions'. [Full review in Spanish].
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
I end this look at the film, hoping the filmmakers will consider an end, as well. Gru and company have had a good run with levels of success most films can only dream of.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Despicable Me 3 is easy for young children to watch, but suffers from a lack of focused storytelling and an unwanted dedication to nostalgia.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Even with all the bells and whistles, and the introduction of a clever villain, Despicable Me 3 wears out its welcome quickly and turns into an overstuffed excursion that eventually becomes more exhausting than entertaining.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
It [message] complements [its] absurdity perfectly within this consistently charming, welcomingly spare, and infectiously funny franchise.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
What it lacks in the story department, the film makes up in creativity and silly fun for the whole family.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Despicable Me 3 wants to have something for everyone, but it spreads everything too thin, stretching some things too long and giving others short shrift. The results aren't despicable, but they are mostly bland at best.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
As silly and delightful as Despicable Me 3 is, there are sentimental and warm-fuzzy family moments delivered with genuine sincerity.
 "
Despicable Me 3,58,53,critic,"
Overall, this is a fun movie in a fun series. They definitely left the door open for a fourth movie and I'll definitely go see it when it comes out.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,audience,"What for many is a disappointment, for me this is the perfect introduction of Spiderman to the MCU, it feels fresh and you get fully into the character without his previous story, which had been shown in the previous two sagas. Tom Holland and the entire cast feel the smell of new, young people who could drive a Spiderman with a better story. I like the appearance of Tony Stark, since it feels super natural without forcing it and this makes Spiderman have a mentor but that he has the will to act himself. The vulture is an excellent villain and does it wonderfully, getting to have a game changer knowing that Peter was with his daughter, something that drove us all crazy."
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,audience,"The best Spiderman film, it truly catches the essence of the character and original origin story.

Homecoming also perfectly ties into the MCU.

Tom Holland & Zendaya are terrific."
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,audience,"Would have been nice to see a Spider-Man movie, instead of another movie where marvel tosses in more heroes just to connect it to their universe. Like alway Tony Stark ruins another movie."
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,audience,"o filme é otimo, apresentando a vida do heroi após os eventos de guerra civil, o carisma do ator e personagem nos envolve na trama não tão complicada mas sem deixar de ser importante para o desenvolvimento do personagem em sua jornada de heroi."
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,audience,Tom Holland is the best Spider-man. PERIOD!
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,audience,"(It's more of a 7.5 I guess.) Pretty solid movie, overall. Good action scenes, consistent characterizations, and a decent hero's journey with consequences for Peter's mistakes. While some jokes try a bit too hard to land, the light-hearted tone makes this an enjoyable romp."
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,audience,AMAZING GROUND BREAKING
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,audience,"Inclusión forzada, sin tomar en cuenta como eran los personajes tradicionalmente, mj y flash, específicamente."
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,audience,"This film is mediocre in several aspects, its characters, its plot, the design of the spiderman suit, very childish."
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,audience,"DAAAAANG!! Now that I watched the trailer, I remember how good this movie was!! I love the plot on this kid Peter Parker is being treated like a kid by Tony. It was a SUPER good movie. I recommend it strongly."
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
Just one more forgettable, indistinguishable entry into the rapidly-growing collection of Marvel's superhero extravaganzas.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
It makes such a difference when a villain is given more than the standard arbitrary screen time. Whilst not perfect and Keaton could have benefited from more screen time, but he makes every scene count.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
The first Marvel Cinematic Universe film in a long while, outside the Guardians entries, to truly feel like a live-action comic book. This is the Peter Parker/ Spider-Man we all know and love

 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
Spider-Man: Homecoming is as perfect a portrait of Peter Parker as I've ever seen, and one of the best Marvel movies to date. Face it, tiger. We just hit the jackpot.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
Tom Holland is good. Really damn good.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
The human-sized stakes make it more exciting, and it's considerably easier to follow the action with fewer moving parts. You don't come out of the film feeling like you've been beaten over the head for the last half hour.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
How much weight can the resolution really hold for Parker, when all it does is fall back on Marvel's original sin of affirming the status quo? It can't help but feel like a really good Tony Stark story nestled between incomplete Spidey adventures.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
Spider-Man: Homecoming is a brilliantly fun film which re-imagines the popular Marvel character with little, if any, room for criticism.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
Spider-Man: Homecoming is funny, action-packed and really smart, with [Tom] Holland being the best Spidey to date.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
Coolly self-aware and irreverent, Homecoming, pits a hero in danger against a boy in school, a boy in trouble with his aunt, in an academic decathlon, a boy in love.
 "

Taken on its own, ""Homecoming"" is a breath of fresh air.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
With Spider-Man: Homecoming, director Jon Watts, his co-screenwriters, and crew do offer us something new, fun, and very watchable with their sweet teen story superhero mashup.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
The performances are great, and the direction of Jon Watts gives us time for our titular character to breathe and still gives us coherent action set pieces for us to marvel at. The script is funny and zips along at a wonderful pace.
 "
Spider-Man: Homecoming,92,87,critic,"
Tom Holland is youthful, energetic and has good teen angst for the newly minted Spider Man.

Amazing, spectacular, and the reboot Spidey has needed since 2007, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a triumph in just about every way and opens the door to a very exciting future for the wall-crawler in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,audience,"Amazing cast! Diana leaning what it is to be human, and being an awesome heroine. Must see!"
Wonder Woman,93,83,audience,"I had very high hopes for this movie, given the reviews and hype -- seriously, it lived up to every expectation and surpassed my hopes for the newest DC installment! It is truly WONDERful"
Wonder Woman,93,83,audience,"Wonder Woman, with a charismatic and lovely Gal Gadot, serves as a solid ""super-shero"" film, that entertains with its stunning visuals, well-crafted action sequences, and the power of love, which, for me, that's the biggest difference with other superhero films. That's where the grandiosity of this film resides."
Wonder Woman,93,83,audience,"Such a fun, and emotional movie. Love the realism, music, acting, and everything else!"
Wonder Woman,93,83,audience,The way everyone got behind this sorry I was expecting so much more. It was OK just certainly not what the hype built it up to be - not even close. Though it does come off like Shakespeare when compared to the inept sequel.
Wonder Woman,93,83,audience,"Great origin story, that ties well with other DCEU movies and shows us how WW came to be."
Wonder Woman,93,83,audience,Speechless..Gal was born to play Wonder Woman
Wonder Woman,93,83,audience,"I really liked the movie called ""Wonder Woman"", it's a mix of action, romance and drama, a truly fantastic mix of genres. Not to mention the twists and turns such as the moment in which each of us expected Erich Ludendorff to be Ares and not Sir Patrick Morgan or the suicide of Steve Trevor who performs an incredible heroic act to save humanity and please the woman he loves. In the end I recommend it to everyone I think it is a film that deserves."
Wonder Woman,93,83,audience,"The best superhero movie with a female lead no doubt. Patty Jenkins did an amazing job at crafting a really emotionally gratifying, inspiring and action packed movie."
Wonder Woman,93,83,audience,"Gal Godot is great as Wonder Woman, but the story felt a little off, still one of the best DCEU films out there"
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
It's easily the best film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) thus far. But what does that mean when your yardstick is [Man of Steel, Batman vs. Superman, and Suicide Squad]?
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Piercing through a lot of the nonsense and bombast, this is pretty crude nationalist and pro-war propaganda.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
The overuse of computer-augmented imagery and wirework and fully computer-animated characters makes everything look just a bit faker, especially during showdowns.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Diana's a strong role model for young girls as she's a fighter and has no time for the typical gender roles placed in society.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Gal Gadot is simply extraordinary.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Wonder Woman would have been a powerful statement just by its mere existence. Instead, we are treated to a definitive genre classic in its own right.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Wonder Woman deserves the success and praise not just because the film is about an empowering female superhero that will undoubtedly inspire the younger generation and women alike - it's just a good film period.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Go see Wonder Woman solely for the fact that it's a fantastic, well made, exciting and emotional film. In fact, I can honestly say, without hyperbole, that this is one of the best superhero movies ever.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Wonder Woman is not only the depiction of a powerful woman that men and women alike needs to see, it's a metaphor for ourselves as well. It's a win for a comic movie universe that very much needed one.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Excellent character development, funny moments and epic action scenes. Jenkins did it: she created the first great film in the DC Extended Universe. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
This film is full of 'fish-out-of-water' humour which comes from a demi-god negotiating the world of men. It is also visually stunning and the action scenes are thrilling - coupling the world of superheroes with WWI works surprisingly well.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Wonder Woman is a flawed superhero origin story. With that out of the way, the good news is it's mostly awesome, brings one of the greatest comic book characters ever to the big screen, and breaks up the boys' club that is contemporary superhero cinema.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Although it has a charismatic role from Gal Gadot, it has nothing exciting for two hours that turns wonderful to yawn. [Full review in Spanish]

 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Part of what I really liked about this movie was that it focused on her as a character and a human being.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Judged on equal footing as all other superhero films, as it and all movies should be, this is a terrific action film, a sly take on gender politics of the early 1900s, and a wonderfully crafted antiwar picture.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
... the directing by Patty Jenkins who shows that she can take a good script and turn out great scenes and coherence. Her way of directing works fantastically well with lead Gal Gadot's interpretation of Wonder Woman.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Wonder Woman stands proudly on its own, and a frankly astonishing sequence of Diana crossing No Man's Land alone pushes a fun blockbuster directly into iconic territory.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
At least, finally the DCCU seems willing to learn from its mistakes and improve over previous entries.
 "
Wonder Woman,93,83,critic,"
Gal Gadot's performance is fantastic to watch, she not only carries the entire film, but she also brings strength, intelligence, compassion and beauty to her role.

Baywatch,18,69,audience,I enjoyed this one as I thought it was a good combination of action and comedy at the beach along with teaching some life lessons and oh yea the beach scenes lived up to its name. Look forward to the sequel
Baywatch,18,69,audience,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. I have watched it a bunch of times and I keep noticing new things every time. I think the reason not many people liked it ... I'm just guessing here but I have watched it when I was fat and when I was in good shape, and somehow it was funnier when I was in good shape. Haters gonna hate - see you in Malibu :)"
Baywatch,18,69,audience,I felt sick of bad stupid jokes half of the time and sick of dismoral and low-level jokes another half.
Baywatch,18,69,audience,"Surprisingly good. If you remember the TV series and accept this is a movie based around that world, then the movie hits the mark"
Baywatch,18,69,audience,"This movie was much better than what I saw with the reviews! I like The Rock in this film, and I liked Zac Efron in this film. The movie was fun to watch, but it just was nothing anything special! I didn't see any wow moments. The hospital scene was probably the best part of the film, but it wasn't LOL funny. There are some good laughs, but nothing laugh out loud. Certain parts were boring in the film. Overall, though this isn't really a movie I would recommend! It wasn't a great film!"
Baywatch,18,69,audience,Terrible! Just like the God AWFUL tv show!
Baywatch,18,69,audience,Silly movie but so funny. The Rock is a legend and Zac Efron is hilarious. One of those movies where you don't have to think too much. Love it
Baywatch,18,69,audience,Light entertainment and laughs at the tv series and how ridiculous it could be (lifeguards being superheroes) but in a good way and enjoyable
Baywatch,18,69,audience,"Faaaaaaar better than I expected it to be. It was over the top and silly but in the best way it could have been, trying to drag the campy source material into a more modern setting and a more modern comedy style. The charisma between The Rock and Efron is off the charts but why wouldn't it be? It's two of the best comedy actors around today when it comes to slapstick and self deprecation. The story is ridiculous but they somehow made it work and it got a surprising amount of laughs out of me. What more could you ask for out of a summer comedy blockbuster?"
Baywatch,18,69,audience,Not sure why the reviews suck.
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
Depending on your point of view Baywatch is either a mindless summer diversion or a continuation of Hollywood's exploitation of our collective nostalgia. Judge your interest level accordingly.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
The antagonist goes so far as to compare herself to a Bond villain, which is an insult even to the very worst of the Bond villains.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
You'll want to pay the piper for the interactions between Johnson and Efron.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
No, Baywatch does not work in the comedic department... nor in the CGI, action, or script departments. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
When The Rock is on screen, ""Baywatch"" is actually reasonably entertaining. But anytime he isn't, which is too often, it's painful.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
Baywatch is an amiable summer action-comedy ... Nothing about it is going to surprise you, its plot is pretty standard stuff ... funny at times, but not as funny as you would hope.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
It's almost disrespectful how lazy this movie feels at times. You have an action-comedy that isn't especially funny or well staged for action, so what are you left with? I guess the short answer is: Baywatch.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
It's a huge missed opportunity, and it ends up feeling cynical.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
At the end of the day, the cast and crew of Baywatch all came together to make something absolutely disposable and utterly forgettable.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
The film is an attempt to pay tribute to the original tv series, whilst poking fun at it. It fails on both counts.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
A really fantastic 40 minutes of comedy sandwiching 80 minutes of ok comedy for a holiday weekend.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
Although entertaining enough and with enough eye candy for both sexes to pass some time, you'll soon forget about Baywatch faster than Captain Jack Sparrow's always sinking ships.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
The new Baywatch takes a more adult approach, but its execution makes the beach feel like a boy's locker room complete with towel snapping, butt slapping, and crotch fondling.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
Amid all the glistening skin, requisite chase scenes, low-brow gross-out gags and, at one point, literal fireworks, Baywatch is content to simply tread water.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
Achieves a level of incompetence rarely seen in modern cinema.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
Baywatch might earn its r-rating but doesn't do anything fun with it aside from the same boring crude jokes.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
It's part cop show, part action movie, part gross-out comedy. All it cares about is delivering a few dozen tense, awkward and titillating beats, without any regard for how they fit together. Somehow, that makes for a really fun, dumb movie.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
Baywatch struggles to find that ideal blend of poking fun at the ridiculousness of the conceit while still embracing it. Like many of its peers, it occasionally falls into the trap of mistaking something crass for something funny.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
It's not a well-crafted movie but what it does is provide some goofy fun and allows the viewer to suspend brain activity for a few hours, and that's just fine by me sometimes.
 "
Baywatch,18,69,critic,"
The cast looks amazing in this film, but there is only so much saving that Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron's abs can do.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,audience,"Not as great as the first Guardians movie.

Baby Groot and some great visuals make it worth seeing though."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,audience,"A step back from the first film. The jokes don't work, the villain is horrible, and it's just another set up movie like all the rest."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,audience,James Gunn was gone I could tel by the music and that was before I learned he was fired. Didn't  have his energy but everything was there.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,audience,Baby Groot! He's my absolute favorite! I think this movie overdid it with the comedy but I still love re-watching it!
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,audience,"To me this is basically the New Star Wars. Characters that are actually likeable and excellent actors. I hate to bring politics into a movie review but the cast all had James Gunns back when he was ""cancelled"" and you can tell. these people have a genuine bond when they act on screen together and it is an absolute joy to watch."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,audience,Oh man. This was just as good as the OG. SUPER funny and it is just a really good movie.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,audience,The greatest PG-13 sequel ever developed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,audience,"Very disappointing. I expected this to be better than the first one, but it let me down. Baby Groot was great though"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,audience,No where near as good as the first film. I like the serious moments better in this film than I like the comedy.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
With vibrant colors of the multiple planets, creatures, and space opera-like battles, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an eye-popping, visual rock concert.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
An overdependence on CG and its wirework equivalent is disappointing, as it makes the already unbelievable stunts appear just that much more phony.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
An incredibly disappointing movie
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
If you want more Guardians of the Galaxy, this movie is sure not to disappoint, even if it deigns to fly a little too high on its own excess.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
Pretty close to everything I've ever wanted from a superhero flick.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
Some can argue that the surprise factor has gone...The first film was a feel good exercise involving infinity stones with a sing-a-long and toe-tapping soundtrack. But the sequel felt like an overcooked and bloated indulgence.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
By the final-act showdown with a much larger threat, you may find yourself inadvertently tearing up. Family can be tough, but then, love usually is.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
How much mileage you get out of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will depend a great deal on how you feel about the first movie, because this is more of the same.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is James Gunn's version of a Marvel Universe Empire Strikes Back: A film that retains everything the audience loves about the preceding movie, yet going deeper to expand the characters and story for further exploration.
 "

A sequel that I enjoyed as if I were a kid swimming in a sea of candies. It is even more fun than the predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]

A really fun time.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
I had a lot of fun in this movie.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
In the end, it isn't about whether it's a better movie than the first installment; like most of the characters within, it's more mature and substantial and doesn't rely on past accomplishments to make it great.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
There are still familiar elements, like the early-80's pop tunes that add to the exuberance of the film; overall the film has a vibrant joy that's infectious. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the antidote for grimdark foolishness...
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
There's a complete mix of fun, laughs and A LOT of emotions all thrown into one epic saga.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
More of the same, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
Gunn and company just go for whatever feels good from moment to moment. They've got jetpacks, and they're not afraid to use them. And I'll have to say, it's pretty refreshing.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 leans very, VERY heavily on the familial tropes (not to mention their redemptive myths), and you need to be able to cope with a lot of sentimentality to fully enjoy this film.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
The fresh part about this is the soundtrack. Man, old-school bangers and nostalgia in the air. An interesting dynamic between Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and her long-lost sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) injects an entertaining sibling rivalry.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85,87,critic,"
It may very well be Marvel's most mature film, zeroing in on the emotional complexities of abuse carried forward into adulthood
 "
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,audience,"Emma is about as enchanting as a plank from Ed, Edd, and Eddy."
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,audience,This live-action adaptation of Disney's classic 'Beauty and the Beast' does a fantastic job of staying true to the source material while adding its own elements of magic to create a incredible film experience. The soundtrack for the film is well realized and Emma Watson does a stunning job as Belle.
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,audience,The greatest version of the French fairy tale!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,audience,"I really enjoy this film. It is by no means as good as the original, but I still enjoy it. I think that it makes several improvements on the original. I really appreciate the fact that they tried to make the Beast and Belle's relationship more realistic."
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,audience,I came across this really long episode of Legion that I'd somehow never seen. Still trying to make sense of it all.
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,audience,"Out of all the remakes this one is by far the best. All the colors, music and art.  Then it ended with actual people singing and dancing. It was just a great movie in my opinion and that could be the small amount of times I watched. Aladdin lion King and Toy story I've watched all his movies so many times the beauty and the beast I've watch maybe twice in my life so this was a really nice touch and the music was just great at the end I liked it."
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,audience,"As with most of the Disney remakes, I wanted to like it but found little reason to."
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,audience,"While it's not terrible and is certainly spectacular to watch, it falls flat when compared to the well-played out love story of the original, instead replacing it with a long and fairly boring story with zero romance."
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,audience,Brought all my Disney-Princess dreams to life! I feel like it was cast extremely well and is DEFINITELY worth a watch. ( It is also fine for young children such as my brother at the time.)
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,audience,Just the classic disney remake. It has great visuals and everyone does a fine job. But if I were to watch Beauty and the Beast I would probably watch the original. This is a really safe remake.
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,critic,"
Beauty and the Beast is a fancy affair, but delivers too little for me to fall in love with.
 "
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,critic,"
A tale as old as time, but this new film brings a new life to the story, while holding true to all the magic of the original.
 "
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,critic,"
This is a misstep in replicating why the original struck a chord with audiences back in 1991.
 "
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,critic,"
There's nothing wrong in saying that Beauty and the Beast heavily relies on our sentimental memories of the original. The message is still the same - beauty is skin deep and don't judge a book by its cover. But I expected more than just simple nostalgia.

 "
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,critic,"
As elaborate and detailed as the production design and costuming are in Beauty and the Beast, there's no real sense that the filmmakers felt the need to truly try anything different. Every magical moment feels borrowed.
 "
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,critic,"
The tale of Beauty and the Beast is one made from magic, and not even soulless commerce can break its spell.
 "

The seamless visual blur of CGI and live-action definitely has you enraptured throughout this classic tale.
 "
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,critic,"
This live-action remake may not be necessary, but it's still a lot of fun.
 "
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,critic,"
It is a bit bloated. Emma Watson is terrific as Belle. But the real scene-stealer is Luke Evans as Gaston. He's having a blast and purposely jamming it up to perfection.
 "

Amid all the ballyhoo and singing, its corporate perfection often feels flat.

 "
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,critic,"
t won't blow you away with originality, but Beauty and the Beast is a charming film which proves that Disney's live-action adaptations are worth sticking around for.
 "
Beauty and the Beast,71,80,critic,"
Merely an expensive, perilously glossy throwback to the same gender norms and social mores circa the 1950s.

Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,audience,"Fifty Shades Darker is dark, but it isn't enough. The sex scenes are sexy, but not as sexy as the first movie. Still, the director decided to play safe. If this movie was darker (what we expected from the title and trailer), then it would be the best FS movie. But it isn't. Its a okay movie."
Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,audience,"this is certainly the weakest of the trilogy, but it's also not a kidney, it lacked emotion."
Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,audience,É preciso ter algum problema pra gostar de um filme como esse.
Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,audience,"Fifty Shades Darker manages to be worse than its predecessor, does not have a cohesive script and is lost in direction and is not captivating."
Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,audience,"What a letdown...but funny in the worst way?
I saw it and yeah...I had fun, laughing I guess? For anyone who tells me that its a beautiful, love story...f*ck off. It was the cheesiest, corniest, most awkward-comedic film. But hey, it worked for a great comedy where the jokes on the film. Seriously, the scenes were so bad you couldn't help but laugh. I think FSoG was better in the aspect to take it a bit more ""serious"" than FSD. This film completely did not give a f*ck, I was disappointed that the plots and other characters (Mrs. Robinson, Jack Hyde, Leila) were weak! It had potential to explore more of these arcs, but it didn't. It was dull and so rushed! Everything was rushed. Even the sex! I'm not expecting full-blown porn but cut the soundtrack songs out, more positions (not just mostly missionary all the time), and please bring in some foreplay. How can a movie about risqué intimacy not show good foreplay? Why does Christian always have an un-emotional face while having sex? No climax either? In the books, wasn't he always grinning (or proudly smiling) for his accomplishment in giving Ana orgasms? For getting off too? None of that...it cuts straight to the next scene. Man...and why was it so Soap-Opera-ish?

I'm not going to lie, I read the trilogy once and I was like, ""whatever, this is the junk food to my brain"". It wasn't good, but whatever... it served some purpose. Did I think that it was the greatest love story? Nope. Did I think it was a great romantic story? Nope. I was honestly intrigued by the fetish that surrounds BDSM. But it turned out, that even if the sex was hot, it wasn't even portrayed properly. BDSM is a whole other level.

I was walking out and a lot of the viewers said that it did poorly in capturing the book. Like sure, the sex was there, but that connectivity...intimacy... was not. It was like : fight, bang (sex). Argument, bang. Present, bang again. It was repetitive in the sense of just make-up sex all the time. Ana is annoying. She doesn't know what she wants in the film or in life. Its like she can't take Christian's dark ways and not kidding, a few seconds later she's okay with it, without any solidifying reason (unless its going down on her or sex) . I feel like FSoG (2015) attempted some direction towards a woman's viewpoint. Like Ana being ""dominant"" in the sense of negotiation and choices. In this film, I'm sorry...she comes off like a gold-digger. She comes off like the only reason she's with him is because he's rich. Its like ""I can't be with you, like this...(he gives her a gift), oh, I love you!) WTF? She tries so hard to be her own woman, but really ends up being Christian's (and not in the cute way like ""Oh, I'm his girl *googly-eyes*) I feel that FSoG (2015) did a better job in where Ana had control and it made sense. Here it's wishy-washy.

Its just a mess, not sexy, everything is rushed that you don't understand the reasoning behind motives. They cut off and rushed great moments and characters that could have given the film more sense, romance and great eroticism. Yes its funny because it tries so hard to take itself serious. But that's about it."

Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,audience,this movie is totally ridiculous did not need a franchise this movie sucks the only good thing is the cast
Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,audience,"It is a film with a poorly supported plot, which reveals the darkest secrets of its character without any narrative impact, in an effort to reinforce the sexual. It's riddled with cheesy moments"
Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,audience,"What in the actual did I just witness? This movie is bad and unlike the first it's off the walls bonkers and makes no sense. And I know movies aren't supposed to make sense but a so called romantic movie should make some sense instead of idealizing you know wink wink. But man in this movie it so called solves everything and makes no sense. The girl who was a former lover of Christian grey had pretty much no time in this movie so why have her at all. Same with the ending, the boss of Anastasia Steele having revenge because he just wants to you know her. This is way worse than the original. The original had you could say a tighter script but it was bad. I legit have no clue what the third movie will have and I'm going to watch the third movie later today."

They are about people who talk a lot about feelings and love and closeness and pain, but we never see any clear-cut examples of any of them. There's a lot of telling, but almost no showing.
 "
Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,critic,"
My one bugaboo about the first film was its unwillingness to lean as hard into schlock territory as it could have, and Fifty Shades Darker most certainly does.
 "
Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,critic,"
It does have a fatal flaw, though. It's boring. Halfway through, I gave up looking for originality in the plot and started wondering what to get from McDonald's for lunch.
 "

Fifty Shades Darker is another boring entry into a series that is somehow shaping up to be even worse than the source material it is based on.

Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,critic,"
Darker flails indecisively between elegance and lewdness and ends up owning neither. Bland, silly and riddled with bewildering and snort-inducing moments, Fifty Shades Darker is ultimately unsatisfying.
 "
Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,critic,"
Between the barely-concealed disdain between the two leads and the story's willingness to conflate sub-dom sexuality and straight-up abuse, the filmmakers' desperate attempts at sensuality are either off-putting, unintentionally hilarious or both.
 "
Fifty Shades Darker,11,48,critic,"
The film is so dull you really do need to be a masochist to sit through it, although some viewers may find the lavish wealth porn an escapist turn on.

Doctor Strange,89,85,audience,"Other than the final confrontation with Dormammu, the cloak, fun visuals and a couple of jokes... it's hard to find much more to like in this one. Kind of surprised it's been received so well."
Doctor Strange,89,85,audience,"Christopher Nolan wants to make an MCU movie.

No, seriously. Stay with me as I map this out. 

After Doctor Strange's director Scott Derrickson riffed on Inception with the city scapes folding over each other, I think Nolan decided do him one better after watching the finale and was like ""Eureka -- backwards time fights! I think I'll call it -- Tenet!""

Joking. Maybe. 

Anyway, Doctor Strange again beats expectations by taking
one of the more fantastical Marvel characters and making his origin story interesting. I actually think that's the formula for the more ""out-there"" comic adaptions. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy, make the characters and cinematography so captivating you don't need to suspend disbelief as we're just riding along with the eye candy. 

Benedict Cumberbatch get's to go FULL ASSHOLE as Strange, a guy so narcissistic he gives Donald Trump a run for his money. Tilda Swinton is always great as the bald headed ""master."" 

And then there's Mads Mikkelsen who is so underutilized in his glitter eye-makeup its criminal. As pointed out by Mads expert @harlenquincade, he did have a good look in that S&M metal body cage. 

""Forget Everything You Think You Know."""
Doctor Strange,89,85,audience,Perfect casting! Great visual effects! Love this movie!
Doctor Strange,89,85,audience,O. M. G. This is probably my favorite Avengers movie. It is so good and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the character of Doctor Strange. He is my personal favorite Avenger. Great premise of the movie and is just such a great movie.
Doctor Strange,89,85,audience,"despite not being what I expected, the film is much more serious and dense than most Marvel films, the visual spectacle is incredible and the characters are interesting."
Doctor Strange,89,85,audience,"A very good movie, maybe not the best of the MCU but a very good movie all the same. The CGIs are beautifully comic book style. The actors are great including Benedict Cumberbatch who is made for the role in every sense of the word, Tilda Swinton also gives a great performance and the rest of the cast. Some will criticize the fact that the initiatory journey of the doctor is similar to that of Iron Man, personally it did not bother me but I understand that some do not like it. But that doesn't mean that it spoils the film."
Doctor Strange,89,85,audience,"Possibly one of my favorites from the Marvel franchise! This movie is tons of fun, has great performances from a Cumberbatch and Swinton, and especially made for an amazing theatre experience with its unique and gorgeous visual effects. The one sore spot I have is the stock, boring Marvel villain. A waste of a phenomenal actor like Mads Mikkelsen. But it wasn't enough to put me off."

There's very little that Swinton can't do and she's absolutely sublime as The Ancient One.
 "
Doctor Strange,89,85,critic,"
The problem with Doctor Strange comes down to the narrative. As this is an origin story, it does take a while to get going. It's again a 'paint by the numbers' and formulaic storyline.

There is more than one way to tell an origin story, and Doctor Strange sets an excellent example by altering the mold, if not entirely breaking it.

Doctor Strange,89,85,critic,"
While it's not in the top 5 of the MCU, it's still a witty and energetic film that gives us something new. Yet as much as I'm already predisposed to be in the tank for the MCU, I have to admit that there's some magic lacking here.
 "
Doctor Strange,89,85,critic,"
Regardless, as clinical as the approach is, Doctor Strange succeeds at blowing the Marvel Cinematic Universe wide open.
 "
Doctor Strange,89,85,critic,"
Pretty standard stuff for a superhero flick, really, but at least it's a coherent vehicle to keep the eye-popping visuals flowing.
 "
Doctor Strange,89,85,critic,"
I'll forgive a film a lot if it manages to show me something I haven't seen before, and Doctor Strange scores majorly on that front.
 "
Doctor Strange,89,85,critic,"
Despite the film's white western gaze towards some of its characters, it's not only aesthetically alluring, but employs eastern philosophies like Buddhism and Taoism to build its narrative framework - a far cry from the way most Hollywood stories are told
 "
Doctor Strange,89,85,critic,"
Doctor Strange holds up pretty well as an origins film.
 "

If you were puzzled by the dream-building of worlds in Christopher Nolan's ""Inception,"" you'll be spellbound by the cities folding in within themselves in ""Doctor Strange.""

Michael Moore in a political stand up routine. I don't completely agree with all of his politics but he always raise accurate points to ponder on America and our system, much like he did in Where To Invade Next. While this is pretty much a Hillary campaign ad let it hide comments on universal health care, women and the economy. Always good for a laugh and something serious to chew on."

Michael Moore in Trumpland won't sway a single voter. It may not even amuse Moore's core audience of disillusioned liberals.
 "
Michael Moore in TrumpLand,54,45,critic,"
Instead of bombast and vitriol, Moore addresses his Ohio audience with softness and gentility, vowing to make them feel comfortable despite the partisan backdrop.
 "

I don't trust Moore's editing: Who's to say the man photographed scowling during a Moore paean to Hillary Clinton wasn't filmed at some other point in the evening, actually frowning at something else?

Barely-edited concert footage that could have been tossed on YouTube without losing much of its dignity and probably only increasing its overall impact.

Ultimately, Moore's an insincere ideologue, no different from Donald Trump or the barking mad Fox News types with which he takes such cartoonish, unfunny umbrage.

It's something to watch and to feel good about, in this most negative of election years.
 "
Michael Moore in TrumpLand,54,45,critic,"
To his credit, Moore never talks down to his audience, but instead uses his knowledge of both candidates' histories to gently skewer Trump's self-serving past business dealings while pointing out and praising Hillary's long tenure of public service.
 "
Michael Moore in TrumpLand,54,45,critic,"
The filmmaker presents a standup-comedy case for Hillary Clinton for president, not as a fan of Clinton but as a patriot worried about the state of America.
 "
Michael Moore in TrumpLand,54,45,critic,"
'Trumpland' becomes a passionate case not for voting against Donald Trump but for Hillary Clinton.
 "
Michael Moore in TrumpLand,54,45,critic,"
Michael Moore is trying to do something almost no one of his ilk is doing: He's actually talking to the other side, trying to appeal to their better natures.
 "
Michael Moore in TrumpLand,54,45,critic,"
Somewhat surprisingly, despite the atypical nature of the film among Moore's filmography, this feature does a great job of highlighting the filmmaker's strengths and weaknesses more clearly than any of his more traditional documentaries.
 "
Michael Moore in TrumpLand,54,45,critic,"
Within the carnivalesque atmosphere and high-spirited revelry of Moore's show, there's a master of political rhetoric at work, and he devotes that mastery to a high patriotic calling.
 "
Michael Moore in TrumpLand,54,45,critic,"
The end goal is most assuredly to secure votes for Hillary Clinton, but the more affecting plea of Moore's movie is a cry for basic human compassion.
 "
Michael Moore in TrumpLand,54,45,critic,"
Moore walks right up to the edge of the stage and asks people why they hate Hillary. It's a ballsy, direct confrontation, one that brings out the best of Moore's blue-collar, guy-from-Flint-Michigan straightforwardness.
 "
Michael Moore in TrumpLand,54,45,critic,"
His ungainly presentation and shaky arguments make for an uneven polemic that never takes fire, even when doused in gasoline.

The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,audience,"Despite the poor ratings it got, I really enjoyed this one and the story it told plus how it told the story which was a different spin on the traditional Tarzan movies as it has Tarzan already in England and returns to his home with Jane. Fun Adventures!"
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,audience,"Don't listen to the bad reviews, this is a very good movie, I enjoyed it so much and it respects a lot the stories of Tarzan of the apes. Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgård were perfect for the roles, one of my favorite films, I'm not exaggerating."
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,audience,"Extremely underrated film! Alexander Skarsgard did a magnificent job with the great iconic character of Tarzan. It seems a lot of people don't understand that this film is following the book of origin for the story about ""The Ape Man"". Because of how different this story is from the other past movie adaptations of this storie origin, it seems most were looking forward to seeing the normal story but were taken aback by this films different story.

The acting is very well done! Every actor did a great job with the characters they were given! However... the actual characters themselves are a different thing. Leon Rom is the main protagonist, whose personality seems a bit bland and very strange type of villain to put up against anyone is this film, for his only strengths are that he is cunning, can squirm out of situations, and can wrap a necklace around other people's necks to choke them to death... Not quite a strong villain to bring a good ending battle against a character fabled to be ""The Ape Man"". 
Now with another character I had a very hard time with... George Washington (played by Samuel Jackson). The dialog and personality that they made for this character is very strange and odd, where it could have been done a lot better. Though, of course, Samuel Jackson did the very best he could at acting out this character. 
These two characters are the reason I cannot give this film more than 4 stars.

The story, very close to its book origin, is quite a different tale than most are used to for when watching a film about ""Tarzan"". This starts out after he is married to Jane and lives in London, but then goes back to Africa and finds that it is in serious need of his help.

This is one problem many viewers have with this film, which is that the gorilla species in this film are very different than how real apes are. This is strange to me, because in the book the gorillas are a type of species the writer made up. So, they are not supposed to be just like real apes. I loved the way the story explains the gorillas from the book, and how Tarzan must deal with them in order to gain their trust. 

Overall, a very well done film that I like to watch many times! Other than those two characters in this film, this movie is a masterpiece production that tires to follow the origin story as best as it could!"
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,audience,I wouldn't ever understand why this movie would get any negative reviews! It was a very good movie I have watched it numerous times. Loved it!
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,audience,I've always loved all 3 actors - but this movie 🍿 felt forced. :(
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,audience,"Seemingly took notes from Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" and provided an unofficial/alternate continuation to Disney's ""Tarzan"" under similarly tonal, faithfully spirited treatment in which Skarsgård and Robbie's performances followed while accompanied by purposefully characterized casting. This moderately exhilarating modern update that feels closer to the source material stands at the podium next to the aforementioned animation with a patient buildup of somewhat incoherently structured pace leading to a very satisfying climax. (B+)"
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,audience,"Absolutely brilliant, from start to finish! Great casting!!"
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,audience,"Legend of Tarzan is an example of poor film-making.
With very poor screenplay, hazy dialogues and spaced out acting, it turns out to be a really sad affair and a sadder engagement.
The real problem with the film is that it tries to do too many things , viz., it tries to champion rights of Negros, it tries to be philosophical and it tries to show the value of brotherhood etc. etc. at one same time, but fails miserably on every count one after other and at the end all you get is a bad dream which you forget sooner the better it becomes."
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,audience,Tremendo cast para esta película tan común
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,audience,"Average work from a director who has done great works in the Harry Potter franchise. The Legend Of Tarzan is boring and predictable for most of the parts, direction and editing were very poor, CGI was average. The actors did what they could with the generic script, though Samuel L Jackson and Christoph Waltz were fun to watch. But its a movie where the supporting cast contributes more than the leads despite of Alexander and Margot's earnest efforts. Overall a mediocre movie which I wouldn't recommend to anyone apart from a die hard tarzan fan. Could've been so much better."
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,critic,"
The Legend of Tarzan falls flat in its storytelling and could benefit from trimming some of the political fat of the story to play on the classical themes of the tale.
 "
The Legend of Tarzan,36,58,critic,"
Relies on snazzy filmmaking - lots of flashbacks and highflying action - and fetching leads to keep things interesting. Even then it feels as if Yates is holding back to ensure a young demographic friendly PG rating.

Apparently, despite holding records for being the most filmed character in cinema, Tarzan's story isn't popular enough to dispense with dreadful, brooding flashbacks.

David Yates may never get to make a sequel (or a prequel) to this story but it will remain in fine company alongside Andrew Stanton's JOHN CARTER as a pitch perfect vision of the writing of Edgar Rice Burroughs.

Honestly, if they could have just settled for broad, barely there social commentary with the occasional gorilla fist fight, this could have been a minor success. A Phil Collins song or two couldn't have hurt either.

Although it may not spark a sequel, The Legend of Tarzan is nice escapist summer entertainment for fans of one of the movies' most classic heroes.

The Shallows,78,59,audience,Watched with John on New Year's Eve 2020 on CableTV Fox Movies. Even for a B-Movie the editing was terrible especially at the start when she arrived at the beach. Nice plot though and a great performance by the female actress. Pretty decent VFX of the shark. Quite thrilling.
The Shallows,78,59,audience,"This movie is very good and entertaining. You feel like you're in the ocean the whole film, and it makes the experience even better. A very well-crafted film."
The Shallows,78,59,audience,"Not one of the best shark thrillers, but Blake Lively gives a wonderful performance within a truly scary movie."
The Shallows,78,59,critic,"
Audiences hungry for shark inspired terror should find enough of interest despite disturbingly inept human characterizations, but something like Spielberg's original Jaws blows this B-movie out of the water.
 "

The Shallows,78,59,critic,"
THE SHALLOWS finds its way to being a clever, tension-filled chompfest that functions as its own unique experience.
 "
The Shallows,78,59,critic,"
The Shallows isn't quite at Jaws status, but it is a refreshingly well done and exciting shark flick in a sea of low budget drivel. I can honestly say that it is the best shark horror film I have seen in at least the last decade.
 "
The Shallows,78,59,critic,"
As shark vs. human movies go, this one is periodically absurd, but generally entertaining.
 "
The Shallows,78,59,critic,"
The bulk of the film stays focused on its classic ""Guy/Girl In A Jam"" premise, and oh, does Lively deliver.
 "
The Shallows,78,59,critic,"
Kudos must go, too, to Lively (The Town, TV's Gossip Girl), who gives her character true grit, all the while toning down the more obvious ploys of the director.
 "
The Shallows,78,59,critic,"
The Shallows is an honest-to-god thriller-one that made me jump and cover my eyes during its most shocking and violent moments, and laugh at its most absurd (there are plenty of those).
 "
The Shallows,78,59,critic,"
The Shallows is admittedly shallow - but effective entertainment. Its value hinges on its capacity to deliver the most basic of thrills without the fervent need to expound on anything. All it needs is a girl, a buoy, and a sea with a shark.
 "
The Shallows,78,59,critic,"
Where Open Water embraced the inescapable dread of the situation, The Shallows intercuts action with weepy monologues and blatant product placement, complete with jarring screenshots that clash with the elemental nature of the story.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,audience,"What a pity to waste such a strong brand with childish jokes and over the top acting. The camera moves way too much trying to mimic that Bay style but even if sometimes effective it feels mostly tiring and the results seems effortless to bring newness in any way possible just rehashing the sci-fi actioner alien invasion through space portal with dumb characters. The CGI, like in the Transformers franchise have a real nice touch going on for them with a great reflection of light and color rendering but in the end it has not that edgy dark villains and developped characters the Ninja turtles 2 from the 90's had...or maybe i am too old for this pit."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,audience,"Lazy writing, plot and casting. Fan service and nostalgia spewed at your face.

Even more insulting than its predecessor."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,audience,"Kinda better than the first film, though by the end it basically levels out as a draw between the two. Too mundane once more.

'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows' does improve a few things, one being the score - not that it's great or anything, but it's more pleasant than Brian Tyler's attempt. Overall it's a little more watchable, but what affects this most is the messy ending - especially with the CGI, which looks like a video game.

Cast-wise it's largely the same, though Johnny Knoxville is dropped - not that I noticed until the credits, mind. Can't say I'll remember any of the cast's performances, just like in the 2014 production.

I guess it's a positive that this didn't completely crap the bed, as sequels sometimes do - especially ones that follow poor originals. Still, this isn't good at all - and, unsurprisingly, killed the would-be franchise early on."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,audience,"May not be the best movie ever made but it at least is better than the first film, and it's quite an entertaining movie overall."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,audience,"Not as good as the first, but still entertaining"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,audience,The best of the teenage Mutant Ninja turtles
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,audience,how does this have moderately better reviews than the first movie? it's not anything worth watching. The turtles have no real arch or even development to their characters and Krang just sort of shows up at the end. ugh what a wreck.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,audience,this is movie is a fun time for everyone no matter the age
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,audience,"What did I think of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows? Check out my full review below:
https://open.spotify.com/episode/0B8wReKaw7y5m398ly11th?si=m3eJMpFdTeWBT7zWP74fWg"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,audience,"Dialogue and story are unfortunately worse than the first movie. The story just jerks from one event to another with little to no setup and sloppy exposition. Where the previous movie attempted to skew a little more toward realism, this one went completely the other direction toward the silly and cartoonish. Megan Fox's April O'Neil still isn't great. At least she's not the protagonist. The characterizations they chose for Bebop and Rocksteady aren't great either. Comparatively, I actually like the characterizations of the turtles. Splinter's pretty good. Casey Jones is okay. This sequel is still unfortunately a move in the wrong direction from its predecessor."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
It's a weird, dumb premise featuring weird, dumb characters. Green has done an admirable job making a moderately weird, dumb and fun movie out of it.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
A huge step up from last time. Most importantly, this sequel captures the bananas spirit and tone that so many people love about the source material. The Turtles still look horrific, however.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
A visually spectacular and fun family film in which the fashionably frantic action sequences, though intense, are bloodless and invariably comic.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
Shadows' main issue lies in the fact that they probably should have cut at least half an hour of run time; an already stretched script is stretched even further...
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
The jokes are dumb, the story is nonsensical and no one seems particularly thrilled to be there, but it's still an improvement from the last one.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
If you would like to spend a great time at the movies, you can't miss this film. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
Not every mistake can be fixed since it still has to serve as a sequel ... but as a post-mortem clean-up job I think they've done admirably in delivering all fans really wanted.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
Entertaining for kids and die hard fans of the turtles, but is too jumbled of a story hampered with a long running time and terrible performances to please other audiences.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
""Out of the Shadows"" might be good for the kids, but it isn't fun most adults would enjoy unless you're already a major fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
All in all I really enjoyed this movie. Most reviews of it are extremely negative so I was sort of looking for a few reasons why they reviewed it that way while I was watching it and you know what? I found nothing that would make this movie terrible.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
It is all crash, bang, wallop action movie business as usual, far too long and horribly repetitive in parts.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
Ninja Turtles, you made me happy, you just didn't make a good movie.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
It's not a good movie. It's a badly executed movie.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
I can't think of one memorable combat scene. How sad is that?
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
This movie has fan service for days. I'm not saying fan makes a movie good, but it's an entertaining movie because it committed.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
It's good to see the turtles are the focus.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
It is 10,000 times better than the first one. The 80's nostalgia was firing on all cylinders. It was like the old cartoons that we all know and love were brought to life on screen, with minor changes.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
Massive flaws aside, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is still a step up from the remake unleashed upon us two years ago, thanks to cramming the movie with a bunch of beloved franchise characters
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
This is strictly popcorn entertainment which is good while it lasts but offers nothing to take back home.
 "
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,38,46,critic,"
So are the Turtles boring? Hell no! They're still as cool as ever. It's just that their adventures have become pointless.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,audience,A very interesting story that gives motivation for each character and makes you feel for them no matter what they do. Overall it's a very surprising and action packed movie.
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,audience,"The best Captain America film in my opinion, probably have seen it 10 times.

Iron Man vs Captain America was done to perfection, the ending fight was great.

Superb introductions of Spiderman & Black Panther."
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,audience,Found it a bit of a slog. Saved from being a five by the inspired intros of Black Panther and Spider-Man.
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,audience,This felt like Avengers 2.5
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,audience,This movie is in my top 5 favorite MCU movies! The Captain America movies keep getting better and better!
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,audience,"this movie is a copy of batman V superman only without the touch of drama it deserves, their fights show that they do not take it seriously and that they are just playing, a mediocre movie."
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,audience,"The Russo brothers did it again. a Superb story that kept me engaged even on re-watching it. Some people say that that this should not have been called Captain America, I don't see the issue considering the main plot point of the movie is about Cap's friend Bucky and the story continues from The Winter Soldier. The set pieces were amazing and the choreographed fight scenes were the best yet in the MCU. Fantastic introductions to the Black Panther and Spiderman. Heart-wrenching scenes that make you feel for every character involved. The only negative is introducing the idea of more Winter Soldiers, just to have that be thrown away to further the plot. Everything about this movie is engaging. Grade: 94: A"
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,audience,I didn't like this film as much as the others in the Avengers CU. I was confused. Why would the Avengers divide? It was executed great but the plot I didn't get.
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,audience,"The 13th film in the MCU is truly something special for long time comic book fans. The story, dialogue, characters, shots, and sequences are all what Marvel movies are about, MARVELOUS FILMS!!!"
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,audience,"The movie isn't terrible as some suggest, but bringing together the two most iconic superheroes of our time should have delivered more. The ultimate cut is superior and tells a better story compared to the choppy narrative of the theatrical cut. The Batman rescue scene is superb and the introduction of Wonder Woman is iconic. The music, though it has its highlights, falls short of its predecessors."
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
All one can think about is the terrible waste of resources, technology and human skill represented by a film like Captain America: Civil War.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
Never mind narrative economy - where's the story at all?
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
Sets about establishing an exhaustingly circuitous plot of betrayal, infighting, espionage, terrorism, and covert operations.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
On the surface, it's one superhero against another. Deep down, it's two friends being separated due to a difference in ideology.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
Captain America: Civil War isn't a flawless film, though I'm guessing most diehard fans will be more in awe of it than newcomers to the Marvel universe.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
Captain America: Civil War is what Avengers 2 should have been.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
Civil War as a whole was a well done accumulation of previous themes and atonement for the events that occurred in previous Marvel installments.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
This is the peak of Marvel's long form storytelling approach thus far-a jumping off point for things to come.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
The film is ... unexpectedly emotional. With the question of friendships and loyalties on the line, the plot does a good job of showing how these tensions honestly affect the characters deep down.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
It's a regular movie that looks like a trailer of The Avengers. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
I don't have time for this plotline anymore.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
It's fatiguing.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
Captain America: Civil War is muscular filmmaking, but never at the expense of character or ideas.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
In the end, Captain America: Civil War is an entertaining film while dealing with complex human emotions.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
It's also packed with stellar action sequences, flashes of humor, and chemistry among the characters that are sheer fun to watch.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
Captain America: Civil War is a fun time at the movies, and among the best of its breed, but you can be excused if you feel superhero fatigue setting in.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
In prior films, Steve Rogers was never given a clear ideological enemy. Here, as if to finally course-correct this omission, the series uses his divestment from ideology as a dramatic question: who does Captain America truly fight for?
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
The Russos definitely know how to stage an action scene.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
Captain America: Civil War is a truly epic and gigantic super hero film with on point emotional moments and the best action sequences to date.
 "
Captain America: Civil War,90,89,critic,"
There is a conviction of purpose that infuses every aspect of Captain America: Civil War. Be it within the characters or the script or the lensing, confidence in purpose abounds at every turn.

Hardcore Henry,52,54,audience,"this movie i enjoyed from the beginning to the end i like the fight scenes, i like the jokes is a movie i can watch another time any day at any time"
Hardcore Henry,52,54,audience,"great fun to watch; to short and action packed.
1st person view if that ain't you're thing watch something else.
nice story not to complicated, just action and some sympathy for the character.
nothing more, nothing less."
Hardcore Henry,52,54,audience,"I had a great time watching. It was a great gimmick and I enjoyed everything I saw- I skipped the first few minutes of talking.

It gets right to it, and keeps it up the entire time. Loved it."
Hardcore Henry,52,54,audience,"It's ok, definitely needs a better cameraman for sure"
Hardcore Henry,52,54,audience,"With its thrilling action sequences and stylish camerawork, it tries to revolutionize the action genre. However, the concept of a movie shot like a first person shooter game it's not fully developed and ends up being very gimmicky, and its potential is undermined by its messy editing, a lack of plot, poorly written characters, and a hammy and cringy performance from Sharlto Coopley. It's like watching a long cutscene of a mediocre video-game."
Hardcore Henry,52,54,audience,That's got to be the gayest jacket I have ever seen.
Hardcore Henry,52,54,audience,"I'd personally recommend this film to those seeking a good action film. It was violent, and being shot entirely from a first person perspective, almost like a video game. But my biggest issue with this movie is, that it constantly shifts its tones."
Hardcore Henry,52,54,audience,Such a great movie! I can't believe the low reviews. I'll probably even rewatch it.
Hardcore Henry,52,54,audience,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and highly recommend.

This is one of the most unique and interesting sci-fi action movies I've ever seen.  Doing the entire movie from first person perspective is an amazing feat all on its own.  If you watch carefully, then the cuts are really subtle if they even exist in places where you would expect them to be.  There are a few points of lost consciousness, but those are the more obvious ones.

Because it is a ""First Person"" movie, Andrei Dementiev literally carries the movie through the camera, but Sharlto Copley (""District 9"") is the repeating character that helps drive most of the movie, so he would be the traditional carrier, as opposed to the mute camera.  Danila Kozlovsky and Haley Bennett give great supporting roles as well.

The problem with the main character being ""super powered"" is that they need drawbacks to balance their benefits so they can ""power creep"" to match / exceed the villain by the end of the movie, and this follows that formula really nicely and in unexpected manners, unless you've seen ""Crank 2: High Voltage"".

It definitely makes it immersive and enjoyable, and there is even a very well written plot happening."
Hardcore Henry,52,54,audience,"This is an action packed move that feels like a video 🎮 . It makes you feel like your the star, has a hard R rating and also has some great comic relief. If you want entertainment and no complexity you'll 💘 it."
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
... Hardcore Henry reads like any other actioner and at various points within the movie it could have fallen into that trap. Through the use of layered storytelling, clever timing, and a competent cast, Henry never gets boring or, worse, exhausting.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
Hardcore Henry is in your face. Literally. If any movie was ever appropriate to use the cliched phrases such as, ""action packed"" or ""a pure adrenaline rush"", this is the movie for it.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
The entertainment level is extraordinarily high, injecting a bit of everything from both the video game world and the action movie world.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
Hardcore Henry is dumb fun, but it's dumb fun done well.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
The power of its kinetic energy and its meticulous bloody choreography from the first to the last minute cannot be ignored. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
Hardcore Henry is fun enough but not in any way worth making yourself ill for an hour and a half.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
It's infantile trash from front to end, with a few neat moments of stunt work that get lost amidst the numbing onslaught of violence.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
It is a lot of fun for fans of science fiction action thrillers, with a nice performance by Copley.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
Hardcore Henry is one of those rare films that almost makes so little sense that it makes perfect sense. But what it lacks in plotline, it makes up for with some seriously innovative first-person special effects.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
Hardcore Henry earns its title in terms of action and gore, but unless one is truly able to invest in an unplayable game with a flat narrative, it also becomes cumulatively hardcore in terms of boredom.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
There were so many moments that made this movie worthwhile...I just wish that they did even more with it...there's no other movie like it, but it's not for the faint of heart.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
Boastfully bloody and violent fun.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
Writing a faithful synopsis for Hardcore Henry would be like writing a plot summary for a Jackson Pollack painting.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
If you are a fan of cartoony action and bone-crunching sci-fi, you need to see Hardcore Henry. It will fill your black heart with joy and make your eyeballs boil with delight.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
Hardcore Henry has no story and is as dumb as a high-school jock, but there is endless potential for what else can be done. Maybe a POV movie with an actual plot for starters
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
It's as if Total Recall met Crank met your PlayStation console - but better, stronger, faster.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
The only surprising thing about an action movie filmed entirely with GoPro cameras is why it took so long.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
The bludgeoning, butchering and bloodletting gets more than a bit old.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
Pugilism is the dialogue of movement, and Henry doesn't stop yammering until the last second.
 "
Hardcore Henry,52,54,critic,"
Hardcore Henry is both the past and future of filmmaking, and isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea ... Copley's performance is so good that you won't be able to stop talking about it.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,audience,The Ultimate Edition is a spectacular movie.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,audience,"Amazing movie with a smart plot and beautiful visuals. Genre is political drama/action, so for those looking for jokes they are not gonna find them here. This is a serious take on how the world would react if among us there were people who can fly and destroy everything if his will wants it to. What can mankind do before/against a superman? Batman has the answer of men, but it might be missguided. For those who wants to think while watching and using your brain, this movie will have some great rewatchability."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,audience,"The Ultimate Edition of this movie is fantastic film. Zack Snyder's visuals are stunning in all his movies and this one is no exception. Certain shots are comic book panels come to life and others look like Renaissance paintings that could hang in a museum. This Batman is the best that Batman has ever been portrayed in live action, and Ben Affleck is a perfect Bruce Wayne. Henry Cavill's Superman is excellent as an alien who is rejected and misunderstood by parts of society including Batman. Lastly, this film deserves 5 stars for the introduction of Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. Her time on screen is brief but impactful. Love it."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,audience,um filme muito bom a versão estendida é melhor mas a direção o roteiro e a atuação estão á frente do tempo
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,audience,A true sequel to Man of Steel. The Ultimate Edition is a must see comic book film. A broken Batman. A Superman still finding his place in the world. A world that doesn't truly understand who he is or even what he is. Batman allows his anger and emptiness to fuel him into a battle with a God. A God he beats only to realize the mistake he is making. Superman rights his path and then makes the ultimate sacrifice. Jesse as Lex is terrifying and vastly underrated. A true comic book film. Others should take note.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,audience,"Even with some of the eye-popping action scenes, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ends up being a hollow, nonsensical film that is crushed under the weight of its heavy themes and ambitions."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,audience,Ultimate Cut Is 10 Out Of 10
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,audience,I actually love the ULTIMATE EDITION of this movie. What bothers me is the slow paced of the movie. But action sequences and actings are great!
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,audience,"This is great movie with stunning visuals and good story telling, it's not without its flaws but the good outweigh the bad."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,audience,"A Masterpiece By Zack Snyder , This movie has  good screenplay , Character Arcs and story specially the ultimate edition is far better than the theatrical version. Still confused why WB decided to remove 30 min from this movie which led to have many plot holes. But those plot holes were corrected by Ultimate Edition. WB should have release Ultimate Edition back on March 25 2016  

Don't know why so many people hate this movie . For me this movie is a masterpiece as i already said will rate it 5/5"
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
Action-packed and epic, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice delivers an unmissable fight between its title characters, and successfully deepens the mythology of the DC Universe as only Zack Snyder can.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
Let's not make any bones about it - on any scale, Dawn of Justice is painful to watch.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
There was a time when superhero movies were fun, escapist entertainment. But now our caped and cowled heroes are as dark and troubled as a reject from a Kafka novel which, in this case, makes for a rather loud but dreary night at the movies.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
It would be nice if there was a moment of dialogue that allowed us to care about the heroes we look up to on the big screen.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
It's bad enough that a single movie isn't big enough for both Batman and Superman; it's even worse that they must share the screen with Wonder Woman and several new villains.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
Cinematography and editing were good. The CGI effects were not overly-done or poorly-executed and that was all this movie needed to be as entertaining and exciting as it was.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is kind of wonderful in a steampunk meets industrial punk sort of way.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
The ultimate edition is a superior version to the theatrical cut and certainly has restored my faith in the franchise.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
This was a violent, miserable experience that only got worse the further it went.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice wants so badly to be an operatic modern mythological tale, but it mistakes great length for epic stature.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
Just like Man of Steel, there are some good things within this over-bloated monstrosity of a movie, but they can't come together to equal a great movie.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
If I had known that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a trailer over two and a half hours long, I would save myself the trip to the movies by repeating the three minute trailer on YouTube. [Full review in Spanish]

It wasn't good.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
This movie was awful... It was so confusing, it was so boring, it was so long.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
In closing, BvS is a big, bold experiment made by people who really care.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
Batman and Superman are supposed to be two very different characters... [But] this isn't Batman v Superman. It's Batman v Batman.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
While Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice is congested in its first two acts, it compels through masterful action sequences and a brilliant new take on the Caped Crusader.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
Exceedingly uneven, alternately exasperating and exhilarating, confounding and compelling.
 "
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,28,63,critic,"
It's great fantasy entertainment.

Deadpool,85,90,audience,"Funny, action packed and everything a guy wants to watch. There's no better actor than Ryan Reynolds for this part."
Deadpool,85,90,audience,Brillian fast and cool nice movie I think it is the most coolest movie
Deadpool,85,90,audience,"While I don't like Vanessa (just my thing since she is simply just a plot device and Deadpool has enough in the comics that they could have done ANYTHING else), it was an amazing movie with so many references. I'm sure people loved the older music. Wasn't my thing, but eh. Can't make everyone happy. But, Ryan, alone made it a 5 star movie."
Deadpool,85,90,audience,It good. That's all I need to say.
Deadpool,85,90,audience,"Penis jokes are funny, screw you Michele Obama!"
Deadpool,85,90,audience,"Very funny, great X-men movie. Raw material and no stakes make this movie very high in the list of best superhero movies."
Deadpool,85,90,audience,Seen this so many times and I've never gotten bored
Deadpool,85,90,audience,"An epic origin story of the coolest anti-hero I have ever seen. Deadpool/Wade Wilson, in my personal opinion, is Reynolds' best role yet."
Deadpool,85,90,audience,"Una perfecta adaptación de los cómics, una diversión hasta el final (incluso de los créditos), una actuación perfecta, simplemente no puedo mencionar un aspecto negativo de esta película"
Deadpool,85,90,audience,How do can you hate this movie? It elevates the superhero genre and is super funny. I mean how do you hate it?
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
It's occasionally a little too rude and crude, bloody and bowed for it's own good but at least it tries to do something a little different in the well-worn context of the superhero genre.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
It's easy to make a superhero film nowadays. However, a film is nothing without great writers that understand the character and an actor that is passionate about it. Ryan Reynold IS Deadpool.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
Goes to great lengths to distance itself from the pack of recent Marvel entities, which have become more or less interchangeable.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
The film plays well over multiple viewings and holds comedy to a higher standard than mere action and wise cracks.

Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
A terrific directing debut from Tim Miller that pretty much awards him a throne made of golden jockstraps on the wings of Stan Lee.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
Witty, profane, and full of action, Deadpool is a nice breath of fresh air.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
""Deadpool"" is the fast-paced (gory), action-packed (violent) and hilarious (incredibly off-color) comic book movie that we needed, but had no idea we did until it came along.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
It bets on violent action and the most twisted dark humor that's been seen in any Marvel movie, of course, with Ryan Reynolds' wild role as Deadpool. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
There is no middle ground with this movie, for the middle ground has been thoroughly set on fire. Those who dislike it will absolutely loathe it. Those who like it will fight a duel to defend its honor. I thoroughly enjoyed it...
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
It's competently made, and mostly fun.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
Coupled with the action-packed fight scenes, Deadpool proves he is here to entertain and he spectacularly does so, thanks to Reynolds' quick-witted performance.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
From the moment the film begins and you see the words ""directed by an overpaid tool"" and ""produced by a-hats"" on screen, you know ""Deadpool"" isn't going to be like any other superhero movie you've seen before.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
It's all filthier, and more hilarious, exciting, and ultra-violent than you can probably imagine.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
This is the first R-rated Marvel film and it's smart, slick, sweet and sexy.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
Wiping away the bad taste X-Men Origins: Wolverine left us with, Deadpool easily overcomes its few minor flaws to deliver a satisfying, hilarious, and action-packed adventure.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
Reynolds totally brings the funny and from the opening credits this hectic, insane script delivered many moments of joy.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
If you know anything about Deadpool then you know Ryan Reynolds was born to portray him. The casting was incredible. The jokes and references were spot on and I couldn't have been more pleased with this film.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
Beneath the vulgar facade and low-budg sheen lies a very self-safe origin story skeleton, one that lives and breathes by the beats of that whence came before it.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
Deadpool has the potential to make previous Marvel superhero movies seem lumbering and ponderously humorless in comparison.
 "
Deadpool,85,90,critic,"
Reynolds makes it work. Sneering superheroes are a new breed, but Reynolds' inherent charm and first-time director Tim Miller's light touch keep the ultra-gory film from veering into gratuitously snarky territory.

The Age of Adaline,54,67,audience,A terrific movie. Excellent cast. Beautifully acted.
The Age of Adaline,54,67,audience,"Let me preface by I love each one of these actors in other works they've been in. However, this movie makes me want to regurgitate yesterday's breakfast. 

First, Adaline is a bland, soft spoken, vapid, beige shell of a woman, which is quite  maddening given her length on this earth. They tried showing her intelligence through being multi-lingual and a knack for trivia but somehow it wasn't convincing. The message this movie sends is that the only thing Adaline has going for her is her looks. Thank goodness she doesn't age.

Let's be honest, if Ellis wasn't a good-looking, successful white guy, he would be a creepy psychopath stalker. Making douchey comments about how she should've introduced herself, forcefully not leaving when she had asked him to, and making borderline sexist remarks like ""pink is for girls"". I'm 5 years late to the game, I get it. but in any year, this guy would be a huge red flag. 

You get the point. I'll stop here because I dont think I need to write an essay to convey how incredibly dull this movie is."
The Age of Adaline,54,67,audience,"I loved this movie.  Blake Lively was excellent as was my other favorite, Michiel Huisman.  He is so gorgeous and best on screen kisser in the history of movies!! No wonder they cast him with the mother of dragons!"
The Age of Adaline,54,67,audience,Very good pace throughout the movie. And often touching.
The Age of Adaline,54,67,audience,"There’s nothing all that great or wonderful in The Age of Adaline, but for some reason I emotionally connected with the film. It has an old-fashioned feel to the romance that I kind of miss in an era where Nicholas Sparks has turned the entire genre into a melodramatic mess. There’s also a simplicity to this film that I found refreshing. It feels like movies this straightforward and downright wholesome aren’t made much any more. I think the biggest mistake they made in The Age of Adaline was feeling the need to explain the magic. Whether it was some focus group, or a studio head, or just an over-zealous writer, the existence of the voice-over in this film was a problem. In movies we can accept magic without needing some ludicrous pseudo-scientific breakdown of the biological process that leads to Adaline not aging. The cast also drew me into The Age of Adaline. Blake Lively continues to prove that she has range as an actress, and I thought this role suited her quite well. She is totally charming and pulls off the wise and experienced personality that would come from living more than a century. Michael Hulsman is not bad, and somehow is likable despite the fact that the script pushes his character ridiculously close to stalker territory. This is also a film I will directly reference in the future when I hear people talk about how Harrison Ford has given up and hardly tries any more. His performance in this movie is emotional, and powerful. I’m not trying to say that The Age of Adaline is a masterpiece or anything like that. However, I found it effective at what it was trying to do, and it hit enough emotional beats to hook me and convince me it might be worth watching again sometime."
The Age of Adaline,54,67,audience,A beautiful movie with a tremendous cast. Loved every moment. Perfect!
The Age of Adaline,54,67,audience,So rare movies come forward like this. So lovely.
The Age of Adaline,54,67,audience,Blake Lively can act! An interesting concept that makes you think. I wanted a bit more at the very end for the conclusion (the last 5 minutes or so) but the movie kept my attention the whole time.
The Age of Adaline,54,67,audience,This movie is boring
The Age of Adaline,54,67,audience,Loved it. I have quirky taste I guess and this movie struck my quirky chord. It was entertaining. It definitely had a science fiction fantasy feel to it. But there was also some romance to it as well. I sometimes repeat watch this movie if there is nothing new I want to see. I think that alone says a lot. 🤪
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
A silly movie that requires an almost impossible level of suspension of disbelief but somehow the metaphysical melodrama, with its lovely design and strong performances over comes the ridiculous plotlines to become an almost timeless romance.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
The excessively science-fiction-steeped setup only undermines the parts that work.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
The joy of Lively's performance is that she creates a sympathetic and appealing character out of Adaline.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
Gorgeous on a visual basis, but remains empty behind a heavily contrived plot, preposterous scientific mumbo jumbo, and unabashed romantic exaggeration.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
One minute I'm baffled and the next minute I'm quite literally falling asleep.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
This movie is so bizarre.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
It is a film with a good technical polishing that takes great care to be an elegant production, but has much less success in achieving a content that at least approaches the level of its form. [Full Review in Spanish]

The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
Ross's voice resonates in our heads with the same intensity as it did in Dominik's film, capturing the essence of the story with its kind, direct and serious tone. Unfortunately, the images say otherwise. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
The unhurried storytelling matches Adaline's endless life, making this a respectable date movie.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
The audience is certainly offered plenty of beautiful bone structure featured in languid close-ups of the two leads, along with jewel-like, memorable moments of acting prowess from the older actors.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
Takes its premise and squanders it on a run-of-the-mill romance that doesn't have the courage to tackle its themes head on.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
The plot is both ridiculous and overly convenient, stealing screentime from the deserving thorough period production design.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
The film's greatest gift might be that it harbors one of Ford's best performances in years. You can never tell these days how invested he'll be in any given project, but Krieger must have the magic touch.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
I thought Lively was strong enough in the role and the chemistry between all was so good I enjoyed it.

The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
It's a lovely idea, but the film misses the mark.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
The Age of Adaline is a plushly packaged and has its fantasy charms, but it could have been infinitely more impactful.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
It's a film that takes itself way too seriously, even when there are campy elements that keep creeping into the material. It kept me interested to a point, before ultimately collapsing under the weight of its own silliness.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
For a movie about a woman who has lived for more than a hundred years, it's disappointing - and more than a little bit baffling - that Adaline is so lacking in dimension.
 "
The Age of Adaline,54,67,critic,"
It has the powerful tang of nostalgia, memory for things we knew or didn't know. It reminds us that time is precious and it's never too late to make a good life.

American Ultra,43,45,audience,Silly caper movie with a great cast and lots of shootouts. Maybe too many shootouts. But a fun enough romp.
American Ultra,43,45,audience,Loved it. Kristen Stewart was awesome and Jesse Eisenberg excellent as always.
American Ultra,43,45,audience,"Ok.. not an Oscar-winner here, but this is a fun movie. It's not your typical action flick where you're just waiting for the next action sequence-- it's more of a love story-- Jesse+Kristen's chemistry is the best part of the movie-- with action and stoner comedy elements thrown in there. There are some really cool twists, and once you watch it a second time, you'll realize how this movie is a master at foreshadowing. Fun and quick movie-- not perfect, the first half is better than the last, but I can't complain I loved watching it."
American Ultra,43,45,audience,It's Pineapple Express meets John Wick.
American Ultra,43,45,audience,There's a lot of fun to be had here. Eisenberg and Stewart are fun and Goggins has a blast with a ridiculous character. The action is strong though it's not as comedic as I hoping for.
American Ultra,43,45,audience,"This movie is a good example of what happens when a thriller gets bogged down with exposition. The tension loses its snap, the action is too little and too spaced out to be a main draw, and the unsubstantive characters make the main plot twist equally uninteresting. It has a good idea at the base of it, which makes it all the more disappointing when the delivery is botched.

Closest comparison: It's like Pineapple Express by way of the Borne Identity.

Setting: Rural Drama
Plot: Secret Agent
Tone: Tragedy"
American Ultra,43,45,audience,"Damn, this is the most underrated film of 2015. It's not hard to see why screenwriter Max Landis was upset the movie bombed at the box office. Less because ""people didn't see my movie, waaaaah"", more frustrated that Hollywood will be more reluctant to greenlight original IPs if Quentin Tarantino or Christopher Nolan aren't involved in some capacity. The marketing didn't help, it being sold as a stoner comedy when the stoner aspect had little to no effect on the plot, pissing off people expecting a spiritual successor to Pineapple Express. While the tone is admittedly all over the place, I can't say I didn't enjoy this movie. It helped that I knew beforehand that the trailers were lying. While the action and score are already really good, where the movie really shines is in the relationship between the two leads. They have great chemistry together, likely helped by the fact that they had previously collaborated together on Adventureland. It also shows how capable they are of acting for anybody who was unimpressed with Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network and only know Kristen Stewart from the most critically reviled movies that were huge box-office successes. Their relationship is hands down the best thing about the movie. If anything, it's better than most actual pure romance movies. My guess is that what pissed off Pineapple Express fans. They wanted an action comedy with stoners, they got a love story that just happens to have action and a stoner in it. While American Ultra could've benefited from a more consistent tone to perhaps feel more accurate to what was being sold, it's definitely an underappreciated film that deserves a higher IMDb score than its pathetic 6.1/10. Seriously, focus more on what the movie DID give you than what it DIDN'T, and maybe you'll enjoy it more."
American Ultra,43,45,audience,"A very fun and engaging film that, while not always living up to its potential, still makes me smile when watching it."
American Ultra,43,45,audience,"This is the kind of movie that starts out like it's something that might have worked in the mid-90's with a different actors.  It then turns into a ‘Manchurian Candidate' chase movie for younger millennials. Now, it's just too polished and too rich for the concept to be taken seriously.  The story is kinda weak.  Still, it's amusing enough and quick enough to not drag or make one think too much. 

2 1/2 of 5"
American Ultra,43,45,audience,"The main character in this movie has awkwardness that he shouldn't have, it almost ruins the movie. Don't have to see this movie again."
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
That the filmmakers have some consciousness of the criminal role of the CIA makes the movie, that is neither funny nor well made, a shameful project from the start.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
The violence often feels gratuitous - we're told Mike singlehandedly kills seventeen people - but the look of stoned amazement that drifts over Eisenberg's face each time he pulls off some feat of derring-do is worth the wanton bloodshed.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
...a better-than-average contemporary thriller.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
Aside from a few bright spots, American Ultra watches like a collection of scenes strung together because it seemed like it'd be cool.

 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
American Ultra lands glancing blows when it should be jamming a soup spoon right in the jugular.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
Excessively violent and gory without needing to be, American Ultra never quite realizes which path it wants to take and leaves you ultimately unsatisfied.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
A promising start that quickly evolves into a convoluted mess of blood and gore.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
American Ultra looks like a wacky mash-up with unique ideas, but underneath it doesn't actually have anything new to say; it is the cinematic equivalent of a hipster.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
A breezy enough diversion (albeit, an insanely violent diversion) that does some clever things with its core conceit. Not necessarily ""ultra,"" but okay.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
A paranoid rant against government surveillance and a scathing indictment of a brainwashed society.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
Even the violence lacks creativity, and simply revolves around disposable soldiers getting whacked with traumatic force simply so buckets of CGI blood can distract the audience into thinking that this movie is awesome
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
It's all very silly, tonally uneven and eventually a bit tedious.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
Individual scenes work well, but they amount to a disjointed whole, thanks to Nima Nourizadeh's direction.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
American Ultra's stoner rambles are every bit as precise as they were with Aaron Sorkin's zingers in The Social Network, and it's a total pleasure to not be subjected to another drooling stoner clich.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
Kristen Stewart can play tough without having to kick ass in a cat suit, but her one great fight scene was too late in the film and too spare to match her potential.
 "
American Ultra,43,45,critic,"
Without the reuniting Adventureland pair Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg as the leads, the film could have easily been just another dumb stoner action film with moderate laughs.

The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,audience,"Despite a slightly messy plot, some underwhelming characters and choppy writing at times, Insurgent- for me actually- improves upon its predecessor with a terrific performance from Shailene Woodley in the main role (and even Theo James), some powerful moments, well-directed action sequences and that it is better paced than the original."
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,audience,Divergent's on the run. Lot of down time. Nice acrobatics.
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,audience,"The film is not groundbreaking, but it features a lot of cool stuff and mind blowing plot twists."
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,audience,Has cool effects but feels repetitive.
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,audience,A bunch of sh*t wouldn’t recommend it
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,audience,I loved it Theo James is my husband 
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,audience,"Right away this movie kills any hope of making The Divergent Series a successful franchise with a terrible plot (which has many flaws in it), awful CGI and scenes leaving the viewer very confused with over complicated elements."
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,audience,It's a movie about immature couple who disobey their parents and try to provoke a war
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,audience,"A much more boring affair than its predecessor, which isn't good given the latter's own issues. Of all my problems from 'Divergent', only the score improves here.

Shailene Woodley's Tris is somehow a little unlikable in 'Insurgent', despite being the protagonist - many of her character motivations are a little up-and-down. Theo James (Four) is roughly the same, though Ansel Elgort's Caleb is utterly pointless; not helped by the filmmakers taking a strange direction with him.

Miles Teller (Peter) gets more screen-time, not entirely sure why though - and that's coming from someone who is fine with him in the last production. Kate Winslet remains massively underused as the main villain, I don't connect with her at all.

The premise in this second film of the series is underwhelming and not all that exciting, making use of the factionless is the right step but they don't exactly nail giving them a larger part.

With all that said, I do actually like how this concludes. It should set up a strong third film. Right...? I'll soon find out! It is, so far, a missed opportunity of a franchise."
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,audience,"While the action and stakes were stepped up from the previous film, Insurgent fumbles a little with a few moments in the script, and some of the CGI earns more groans than gasps of delight. But the cast keep knocking it out of the park and the story remains nearly as gripping as the first movie."
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,critic,"
Did all young-adult science-fiction authors of the last decade get together before writing their novels and determine to start with the same basic plot?
 "
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,critic,"
A bit more action-packed than its predecessor.
 "
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,critic,"
Its biggest weakness is its inability to stand out from the pack, resulting in a story that feels bland and lifeless.

For good or ill, with all kinds of murder, jumping on and off of moving trains, and hallucinatory fever dream, this is definitely a spectacle to behold, one that will leave you baffled, wondering what the hell you just watched.

Insurgent surges with unparalleled exhilaration.
 "
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,critic,"
Insurgent is better than it's predecessor, Divergent, but that's hardly a compliment. It struggles to tell a messy story that even it's clunky, expositional dialogue couldn't help make sense.

Maybe we are all getting Dystopia Fatigue, but I need more to care about if i'm going to wade into this level of despair.
 "
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,critic,"
The plot's a bit stretched out, but good performances and the series' impressive production value mean it's a serviceable stopgap before the real action of Allegiant.
 "
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,critic,"
If you're able to push aside the confused machinations of the larger plot during the scenes of flashy violence, you may be able to find a bit of enjoyment in Insurgent. Beyond that, there isn't much nice to say.
 "
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,critic,"
Insurgent seems to indicate that the studios are content to simply go through the genre motions with this one. Whatever promise was offered by the first film is largely gone, leaving the franchise to plod to the finish line.
 "
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,critic,"
Will I see them both? Probably. I'm a completist, so I want to see this storyline to its conclusion. Do I recommend that others embark upon the same journey? Probably not. I'm not that mean.

The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,critic,"
It's a step in the right direction, but I'm still waiting for the film to deliver on its promise.
 "
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,28,58,critic,"
Insurgent is the halfway mark of a series, and, despite the dazzle, it failed to deliver the excitement or intensity that the first film (however naïve) promised.

Sadly, the better-than-okay performances cannot salvage Insurgent from being dull beyond recognition.

Max is cynical, joyless, and filled with surprising violence.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
Filled with emotion, the joys of summer, the excitement, and thrill of adventure, there's nothing quite like the story of a boy and his dog.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
Max is deceptively simple and entirely effective. Heart-melting and humorous, this moving film has more to offer than an adorable dog.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
Yakin may let Max may meander a little, thematically, but any filmmaker who takes the time to craft a family film (only a smattering of language and ""peril"") wedgied in the same week as an R-rated movie about a degenerate stuffed bear is OK in my book.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
Suckers for animal movies will forgive the movie's predictability, but even the jaded may find that its script and musical cues reveal an occasionally thoughtful film wrapped in multiplex sheep's clothing.

Max,37,70,critic,"
""Max"" is a family film that will capture your heart, pull on those heart-strings quite a bit, and deliver a message for every age.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
Max is a doggy tale of canine heroism that comes with such a generous side-order of good ol' American, flag-waving patriotism that its potential appeal to British audiences will surely be limited.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
How a sweet story about a boy and his dog turns into a lame thriller about backwoods weapons dealing is anyone's guess.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
I'm sure a few people will be easily manipulated and distracted by the cute dog. It happens. Otherwise, Max is a waste of your time.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
Despite some great performances from both the young Wiggins, Thomas Hayden Church and the impressive and loveable Max, if you're looking for anything other than a minor distraction you're barking up the wrong tree.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
Lost in this shuffle of bullets and narrow misses is Yakin's stated goal of telling a story about the great service that military dogs provide... I'm not sure where that film went, but the bizarre, violent mess I saw isn't it.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
There are life-and-death moments for both people and animals. But there are also moments of great vividity, of tearing through the woods with a dog at your side and choosing difficult honor over expedient disgrace.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
Though littered with sentiment and family movie hokum, this story of a military dog suffering from post-traumatic stress finds the essence of true friendship, prompting uncontrolled saline leaks from the eyeball.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
Max is much more interested in action than character development. The sad result is a noble film that starts strong but quickly circles the drain by the end of its 111-minute run time.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
It starts off as a perfectly sweet and touching family film before making an abrupt left turn into something much darker and less appropriate for young children.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
It has its moments--mostly involving the title character, a Belgian Malinois--but its human story remains stock and stodgy. A lot more bark than bite here; Max is nothing to go mad over.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
I wasn't expecting to like Max - it's the story of a military-trained dog that is shipped back to America after his handler is killed in action - but it's surprisingly enjoyable.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
Does a mediocre job at recognising the contribution of animals in wartime.
 "
Max,37,70,critic,"
A watchable but predictable family film drenched in stars-and-stripes piety - Lassie Come Home with combat stress.
 "
Aloha,20,28,audience,"The only amazing thing about Aloha is that the film can have such a star-studded, talented cast and that's not enough to redeem this horrible, misogynistic, tone deaf disaster. It's clearly a Cameron Crowe vehicle as it has the same characters going through the same type of drama and finding the selfless, beautiful, far too young for them, ""manic pixie dream girl"" to worship them for their flaws. The man, of course, will never actually get to know or respect this woman, but only spout meaningless, lustful drivel at her while a romantic song plays through their kiss. This could be the same review for Jerry Maguire/Vanilla Sky, etc. etc. Aloha is even more offensive to a viewer's enjoyment with it's casting of Emma Stone as a half-Asian/Hawaiian woman. There are other casting missteps: John Krasinski as a stoic, macho soldier? Not exactly. Bill Murray is completely wasted. The plot is also vague and confusing, but also so boring you don't care enough to figure it out. The only highlight for me was Danielle Rose Russell's performance as Grace - the amount she conveys whilst nearly silent since Crowe didn't give her any lines (next gen manic pixie dream girl) - is outstanding and real."
Aloha,20,28,audience,Way better than they say love it!!!
Aloha,20,28,audience,"Si percepisce fin da subito l'assenza del giusto feeling per vedere quella che si pone come una commedia amorosa e che invece si trasforma in una serie di bizzarre conversazioni e personaggi no sense.
L'abilità del cast rende un minimo più interessanti i personaggi interpretati.
Finale sbrigativo e forzatamente a lieto fine."
Aloha,20,28,audience,"Full of sentiment and transcendence. Human, tender and funny!
Poetic and colorful. 
Torn by the critics. Watch it definitely! Prove them wrong!"
Aloha,20,28,audience,"I enjoyed this film.  I don't like chick flicks or romantic films in particular and this had more to hold my interest - a less obvious storyline than most Hollywood romances and characters with a little more substance.  Bradley Cooper is also, most definitely, my cup of tea."
Aloha,20,28,audience,"Weak plot - poor character development, not much in its favour really"
Aloha,20,28,audience,By far the worst Crowe movie.
Aloha,20,28,audience,"Bad choices, terribly written side characters, mishmash of tones.  Decent efforts from some of the actors, but it's clear that no one knew what movie they were in, because the director didn't know either."
Aloha,20,28,audience,"Really good, I recommend it"
Aloha,20,28,audience,"Great cast who are all very likeable! No, it isn't a ""cinematic masterpiece"", but it is a charming romcom that delivers!"
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
A sweet natured misfire, a movie that, to once again paraphrase Crowe, does not show us the money.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
It was like Cameron Crowe does a Wes Anderson film, and the result is ""huh?""
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
It just didn't jell. It was like forcing a circle into a square.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
There is an undeniable charm to some of the scenes of this movie, but few movie lovers will be offering it ""warm aloha"".
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
Crowe paints with a broad and often heavy-handed brush, leaving us with a film that seems strangely unsure of itself and what it wants to be.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
Aloha starts off in Elizabethtown-esque territory but, perhaps thanks to winning performances or the stunning island scenery, it becomes something better.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
Aloha is often surprising, sometimes fun and occasionally tone-deaf. If Cooper, Hawaii and/or slow-building thrillers appeal, then this is recommended despite its flaws.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
The film is a valiant effort, with flashes of wit and intelligence; but overall, the film takes on too much and accomplishes little.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
Aloha is a featherweight concoction that's fuzzy in the head and squishy in the middle. Yes, there's even an obligatory happy couple montage, but the film is also nuanced and eccentric in ways that are very unusual for a studio comedy.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
I'll take this romantic movie over a Nicholas Sparks film any day!
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
There are elements of Aloha that are actually quite good, but ultimately it's two mismatched movies smashed together and is too messy to succeed.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
It's another pretty trifle -- albeit one with huge aspirations that go nowhere.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
When a major plot point hinges on a chance encounter with some video shot by an irritatingly precocious 10-year-old, well, you know something's awry.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
Half the time while watching Aloha, I had no clue what was going on. Not so much the plot -- although I was admittedly a bit muddled on that, too -- but why anyone acted the way they did.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
It seems less that Crowe's gifts have escaped him than that they've become disproportionate with his excesses, and we're less forgiving of those trespasses.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
Aloha is Hollywood's biggest Hawaiian wreck since Michael Bay sunk those ships in Pearl Harbour.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
A curious twist on the body swap comedy, with its talented creator and stars ostensibly pulling a switcheroo with a group of exponentially less talented people.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
It's hard to know what anybody involved in this misbegotten mash-up was thinking, other than 'Hey! The shooting location's in Hawaii!' (The state looks beautiful here, but that's a bit like saying Sharon Stone was attractive in Basic Instinct 2.)
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
A mess of a romantic dramedy full of colonialistic offensiveness, forced quirkiness, implausible emotion, and oblivious masculine self-centeredness.
 "
Aloha,20,28,critic,"
Crowe seems to be searching for a story with something interesting to say as opposed to telling a story with something interesting to say.

Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,audience,"Improves towards the end, but for the most part 'Pitch Perfect 2' is a disappointing sequel.

I wouldn't say it's anything bad, but even soon after viewing I am struggling to remember any good moments from it. I found the cast and music to be the big plus points to 'Pitch Perfect', though both of those things are off in this follow-up.

Anna Kendrick (Beca) doesn't really do anything, at least very little that's even close to being memorable. Skylar Astin (Jesse) takes a back seat, which I don't actually think is a negative. Adam Devine (Bumper) and Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) aren't as amusing, though the story featuring those two probably did interest me most. Hailee Steinfeld, meanwhile, is an alright addition.

Not a sequel I liked. Hopefully the third film improves upon this."
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,audience,Not close to as good as original but somewhat enjoyable
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,audience,"Praticamente una copia più deprimente del primo film, con umorismo peggiore e coreografie dalla qualità palesemente inferiore. Alcune canzoni rappresentano l'unico aspetto salvabile, ma l'umorismo ai limiti dell'imbarazzo affonda il film in un baratro da cui è impossibile risalire."
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,audience,"It's been three years since the Barden Bellas (Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson) became the first all-female group to win a national title. All seems well until a botched Lincoln Center performance for the president leads to a scandal that strips them of their performing duties, causing internal tension and strife. With the world championships on the horizon in Copenhagen, Denmark, the women must get their act together for their one and only shot at redemption. Same thing as the original. Just a bit slow."
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,audience,"This movie was my least favourite of the three. The movie seems choppy and just kinda confusing. I did not enjoy Hailee Steinfeld's character, she just seemed forced. Although the film wasn't the best, I did love the songs which they sung and I loved the incorporation of Flashlight, it was a bop. 

I definitely recommend this movie, but just keep in mind it is not as good as the first movie."
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,audience,"There were lots of peaks and valleys in this one as they managed to up the joke quality in most instances, with Rebel an obvious highlight (in particular her going after Bumper) and the announcers were still good entertainment even if the jokes were a little racially-charged, but I guess they developed Astin's character TOO well in the first movie because they decided there was nowhere to go with him and minimized his role after they'd done such a great job the first time. They seemingly replaced him with a rather unlikeable Steinfeld character - it felt like they were trying to do a different flavor of unique for her that the group dynamic didn't really need and it added to the overall sense that this movie wasn't setting out to achieve fame for those worthy of it but rather sort of presenting the girls in a hierarchy of how famous they already were as actresses, with Steinfeld serving as third fiddle to Rebel & Kendrick. The musical performances didn't seen quite as good as they were the first time, though they probably were and just weren't as fresh. The Germans made for good villains in a general sense, but it seemed they were only chosen so that German-flavored jokes could be made."
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,audience,"This movie is so good. The songs, harmony, all of it are pretty good! Anna Kendrick's and all of the casts voices are too good to be true."
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,audience,"The sequel to Pitch Perfect ups the music and the laughs, but with a similiar formula it falls behind on what made the first film so special. This film is very enjoyable, I think the music in this one is better than the first, but the story goes down some weird paths that were unnecessary. For what it is, this film isn’t meant to be the greatest achievement in cinema but it sure is a entertaining follow up that fans of the series will continue to come back and sing along too."
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,audience,"It's great to see Artie Lange sober and working again, but this is the least convincing biopic of John Wayne Gacy I've ever seen. "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,audience,"Not quite as fun as the original and it lets a handful of characters fall by the wayside. Still, it's really enjoyable, the cast keeps their strong chemistry, and the music is good."
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
Another fun and wild romp with the Barden Bellas.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
Very much a fans-only affair.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
Anna Kendrick once again impresses vocally and with the depth of her performance.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
The DNA of the first film is still there, but the lightning in the bottle has faded. This is a looser story, with a narrative that meanders around in tangents and unnecessary side plots.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
More a collection of funny moments and musical performances strung together than a coherent narrative, Pitch Perfect 2 should still satisfy fans of the first film.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
It's basically the ""Hangover 2"" of a cappella movies.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
I didn't like this movie. I found it rather offensive, pretty upsetting, and boring.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
To put it in more musical terms: If the original was an album you still play on repeat without skipping a song, this sequel is worth putting in sporadic rotation for a few killer tracks.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
Whilst it's fun in the high notes and high jinks, Pitch Perfect 2 has too many low notes to compete with the original. Aca-average.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
Pitch Perfect 2 is a witty, fun celebration of women who empower both themselves and other women.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
In the end Pitch Perfect 2 isn't creative or different but I can't deny that it made me laugh and I loved the music.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
Banks smartly sticks with what works: sarcastic humour, more than a dash of slapstick and big songs.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
It is down to the fact that these are such likable and fun characters that makes the film thoroughly enjoyable.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
Pitch Perfect 2 is a great sequel that doesn't necessarily mix the formula, but still entertains. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
There was so much potential for awesome, and yet, it just fell flat.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
The musical numbers zip, and the one-liners come fast and furious, but [director Elizabeth] Banks reels it all in to a satisfying concoction that fans of the original will surely enjoy.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
For a film that screams look beyond the surface, PITCH PERFECT 2 largely perpetuates stereotypes.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
The main reason to see the sequel is the same reason you saw and loved the first movie: the songs. The music is inventive, inspiring and just really, really fun.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
I am happy to report that Pitch Perfect 2 is one of those rare sequels that satisfies fans.
 "
Pitch Perfect 2,65,64,critic,"
""Pitch Perfect 2"" is a predictable repeat of the original with updated music, dance, and competition.

The Longest Ride,31,71,audience,"Seems like the ""top"" critics are the real losers with this movie.  Great chick flick.  Nice ending.  Easy to follow.  No Brainer.  What else do the losers want?"
The Longest Ride,31,71,audience,The modern couple's story is very cliche and boring but the older couple's story really touched me. Those short scenes made up for the whole movie in my opinion.
The Longest Ride,31,71,audience,One of the better Nicholas Sparks adaptations. Will happily watch again!
The Longest Ride,31,71,audience,Love this sappy movie. I'll be watching again.
The Longest Ride,31,71,audience,It's a typical Sparks novel turned movie. I really enjoyed it. All the actors do a wonderful job.
The Longest Ride,31,71,audience,This is a very heartwarming and touching movie.  It is a love story of two couples from different eras and how their stories parallel each other in the search for happiness.
The Longest Ride,31,71,audience,"The Longest Ride is a film based on a couple who falls in love, even with their differences. Luke is a bull rider who is looking to make a comeback after an injury. Sophia is an art major who is deeply inspired about art. Luke and Sophia meet at a bull riding show, and they instantly hit it off when they saw each other later that night. One night they saved an elderly man named Ira, an art collector, who would change both of Luke and Sophia's lives. This film had many sweet moments, while still keeping it entertaining. One thing I thoroughly enjoyed was the flashbacks incorporated throughout the film. Ira talked about his wife and how they were able to make their relationship work so well. They showed these moments through flashbacks, and related them to Luke and Sophia's relationship. Ira talked so passionately about his wife, and it was so nice to see the similarities between their love stories. They came from very different generations, but the way they were related was fun to watch. The flashbacks also gave the audience something to relate to through the different generations. Couples watching could easily see how love is the same throughout so many generations and time periods. The audience could also relate those flashbacks to their parents or grandparents. I really enjoyed how it gave the audience something to relate to. Another thing that I really enjoy about this film is how it shows that each person in the relationship has different passions. Luke's passion is bull riding, and Sophia's passion is art. These differences may cause rough patches in relationships, but this film is a great example of how to not let that happen. I really like how Luke fully supports Sophia's dreams. Many times we see the woman just following her partners dreams, rather than her own. Luke is very supportive and this is such a good characteristic of a healthy relationship. Sophia is also supportive of Luke and isn't selfish when it comes to her dreams. I think the film does a good job of staying away from certain stereotypes. Lastly, I enjoyed how much this movie had me on the edge of my seat. I would not consider this a boring movie, as I felt entertained the whole time. The flashbacks definitely contributed to this. It was almost as if there were 2 story lines at once. I think it was a really good balance and wasn't overdone. The flashbacks stayed parallel with the main story line throughout the movie. I also was not able to predict what was going to happen. In many films you can often predict what was going to happen next. I was surprised many times throughout the movie. I was most glad that the ending was not what I expected. It totally took a turn and surprised me. My favorite part of the film was the ending because of how unique it was to other love stories. I was entertained throughout the full movie, and I loved the ending. It is definitely worth the watch."
The Longest Ride,31,71,audience,It is your typical rom com but the addition of the side story with Alan Alda's character make a worthwhile watch. Good watch unless you're a douchey movie critic.
The Longest Ride,31,71,audience,good overall romantic story with a few intertwined stories to make it interesting and enjoyable
The Longest Ride,31,71,audience,Perfect romantic movie with happy end
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
After an hour, I was like, ""no, I'm over it.""
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
[T]he movie is painfully cliched, poorly written, and so ethically skewed that I take strong umbrage to its message.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
It needed more tragedy... it's a Nicholas Sparks movie after all!
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
One of the best [Nicholas] Sparks' adaptations ever.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
Another cookie-cutter Nicholas Sparks adaptation emerges undercooked, seemingly without undergoing redrafts or second takes.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
It's a tried-and-true formula that works, and given the right romantic pairing, works wonders. And admit it, you love it.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
So much of these kind of movies depends on the connection between the lead couple and these two had it.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
And like their predecessors, they and their co-stars Oona (granddaughter of Charlie) Chaplin and Jack (nephew of Anjelica) Huston succeed in making The Longest Ride enjoyable enough.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
This is your standard romantic drama, with a checklist of the genre's cliches peppering the film's way too long 139-minute running time.

A Good Ol' Fashioned Roll In The Hay
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
The Longest Ride did not convert me to being a fan of romance films, but it did show me that I can enjoy parts of one.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
Even by Sparks's standards, this is clichd old stuff, not helped by the fact that the young actors in the contemporary story -- Britt Robertson and Scott Eastwood (yes, Clint's son) -- are no match for Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
I'll say this for The Longest Ride: It did not make me want to burn anything down.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
Scott Eastwood's less mysterious than dad. Clint's got more warrior, Scott's got more lover. Nevertheless! Scott's very Clinty! 'Ride's' the anti-'Fifty Shades of Grey.'
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
[It] so casually meanders down a cluttered road of clichs that you feel chided for daring to take a single ounce of it seriously.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
This could have been the second-best Nicholas Sparks movie had it just been Ira and Ruth's story. Instead, The Longest Ride is weighed down by an unnecessary second story that tries too hard, and bullpen full of clichs.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
Its theme of cherishing love when it comes your way couldn't be blunter, but on the whole this is one of the better Sparks movies, with even a neat twist in the tale to reward those who last the distance.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
Unfortunately, Chaplin's brilliance, Alda's funny crustiness, and Eastwood's vulnerability aren't enough to keep this film afloat.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
The Longest Ride is a weak sauce addition to the Sparks empire, a little better than last year's The Best of Me, but miles below uber-Sparks work The Notebook.
 "
The Longest Ride,31,71,critic,"
The Longest Ride is what happens when a studio exec sees The Notebook and Dear John, and then goes ""You see that? Do it again the same, but different.""

Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,audience,"If I had a nickel for every time Seuss rolled in his grave, I'd have enough to make my own movie."
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,audience,Surprisingly good and had some different takes on the original stody.
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,audience,My child absolute loves this movie!
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,audience,This is another underrated movie. It's sad how it is considered a rotten movie. At least it is better than the live-action adaptation.
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,audience,"it's not the same as the original, just a souless cash grab film, this film could of done better but it doesn't at all, just a 2 and a half star >:("
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,audience,"Visually amazing, along with an interesting new way of telling the Dr Seuss classic, it seems like Illumination is actually trying again, with some entertaining results."
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,audience,"First of all, Dr. Suess didn't want his books to become movies. ""Oh my god! Dr. Suess is dead!? That means that we can make movies without his approval! Hooray for money!"". This movie completely takes out what made The Grinch, well, The Grinch. They just make him a grumpy guy that doesn't like Christmas with a useless back story. Yeah, this movie is a no from me, Cheif."

When you are working with source material as tight as How the Grinch Stole Christmas! - a lean, mean 26 minutes, after all - anything added is pure fat.

Quite rad.

A feast of festive fun will appeal to both kids and adults alike. Lots of Christmas joy with a reminder that love and kindness is not just for Christmas.

Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,critic,"
[W]hile this take on the story isn't particularly cynical or crass as one may expect, it's also pointless at its core when placed into any other context.
 "
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,critic,"
The purpose of the 2018 iteration of The Grinch is to bring the story to children who haven't gotten a chance to see the original. There's enough charm and freshness to keep it's spirit alive.

It's not a work of genius, but it is one of the best things Illumination has been a part of in its filmmaking history. Let's face it, it's tough to mess up a classic.
 "
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,critic,"
A festive treat that is a sort-of delight.
 "
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,critic,"
The Grinch is a good Christmas movie, I guess. It covers all the bases and has a good message but it fails to be as good as other versions because it chooses to do too much.
 "
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,critic,"
This adaptation...finds a way to tell the story anew and seeks to provide more depth to the titular Grinch while also expanding Cindy Lou Who's role in the story.
 "
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,critic,"
As this is the season for family moviegoing, The Grinch throws its hat in the ring as a solid offering to spend one's hard earned money on.

A full-hearted assault on cynicism - this is a wonderful Christmas film with personality and charm enough to light up the hearts of a thousand Grinches.
 "
Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,critic,"
A fun family film that is beautifully animated. While not as enjoyable as the tighter-paced classic, the updated graphics can be appreciated.

Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,59,50,critic,"
The Grinch takes a classic short story, adds some pointless plot digressions and then seems to completely miss the point by the end.

A fun new take on a classic tale, The Grinch exceeded expectations. It isn't perfect, but it is a fun holiday movie for the whole family to enjoy.

Shadow in the Cloud,77,35,audience,"Confusing, BORING AF, where did the ""creatures"" come from, the baby, where do I even begin. I'd rather have been sleeping than wasted that time."
Shadow in the Cloud,77,35,audience,The writer and director should be banned from Hollywood form making more of this garbage. Chloe does the best she can with the crap she was given. This movie could have been good with better people not on the screen.
Shadow in the Cloud,77,35,audience,"Take the premise of the famous Twilight Zone season five episode Nightmare at 20.000 Feet and add to that the World War II period and a message about sexism and you've got Shadow in the Cloud - a silly, weird new genre-bender starring Chloe Grace Moretz. Although the movie is uneven in these elements and it got very silly toward the end, it is undeniably incredibly entertaining to watch and the one-setting thrills are well conveyed. The VFX of the explosions are shaky, but the gremlin looked great."
Shadow in the Cloud,77,35,audience,"The action was intense, but completely unbelievable.....one kind of needs to forget about physics and just buy into it....the creature cgi was comical. I was trying to figure out why this film got such a high rating from the critics......but it basically portrays all the men as unintelligent, misogynistic jerks, while the sole female is portrayed as smart, level headed and tougher and more badass than all the males in the film put together. So that must be the reason. #girlpower?"
Shadow in the Cloud,77,35,audience,"Garbage.Why this crap show got 77% on here reinforces my decision to ALWAYS disregard Rotten tomatoes scores. So a woman with 0 combat xp takes down ALL the enemy aircaraft but manages to miss a stationary target (gremlin) 6ft away ,crawls under a plane at 8,000 ft full speed and hooks a 112lb package with a steel pipe and out stretched  arm at speed, chases down and single handedly kills a creature that can tear open the engine of a plane with its 7"" razor claws while all the men just watch, not to mention all the men that were being WAY over shovanistic for that time period got wasted one by one as if to say ""that's what those bad men get"",and on and on ending with a up close breast feeding scene that was tacked to show how a strong woman can out fight a group of soldiers and feed her child. Even the burning face of the Pin Up girl was a PC statement.Then I seen the directors name at the end and it all makes since. All that was missing was a tampon throwing scene,stand up peeing,and the surviving males, who just so happen to be the only ones that weren't PC to females, kneeling down to her feet. This whole movie coulda been so much better without the PC women's rights bull mashed into a pile of plagiarism with no plot or substance. Long story short, this would have been a great movie if a man without and agenda directed it."
Shadow in the Cloud,77,35,audience,So.  What do you get when a female WWII pilot sneaks onto a bomber with her baby in a box and a gargoyle thing is out on the wings?  You get this film that makes pretty much no sense.

Trash cinema made with love and thoughtfulness and a terrific sense of fun.

Kiwi filmmaker Roseanne Liang (My Wedding and Other Secrets) very much delivers the genre goods in this rip-roaring high-concept World War II action thriller shot in New Zealand.

It's a foot-stomping, high-fiving, hard-out, and hilarious big-screen fun time best enjoyed in a cinematic mosh-pit.

Shadow in the Cloud is a cinematic tour-de-force and terrific fun.

Shadow in the Cloud,77,35,critic,"
Shadow in the Cloud has every ingredient for a cult classic, it's just a shame that it's so fatally underwritten.
 "
Shadow in the Cloud,77,35,critic,"
Liang's firm handling of the paranoia and claustrophobia make this movie all her own, however. For much of its brisk 83-minute running time, she puts the audience in Garrett's cramped ball turret, trapped and bracing for the next attack.

A tribute to the pulpy adventure movies of the 1940s by way of The Twilight Zone.

When Shadow in The Clouds drops everything it holds precious to roll up its sleeves and fight, it's firing on all cylinders.
 "
Shadow in the Cloud,77,35,critic,"
There's enough in the first half of Shadow in the Cloud to recommend it as a fun lark. Thank goodness Chloe Grace Moretz is there to save the day, both as an actor and character.
 "
Shadow in the Cloud,77,35,critic,"
Shadow in the Cloud is an enjoyable popcorn movie that promises in-your-seat jumps with a handful of gender politics thrown in for good measure.

Boys State,94,90,audience,"Meh.  This documentary that follows the Boys State tradition in Texas feels like a spin in itself.  Maybe it's because no adults speak or represent purpose in the film.  Nonetheless, an interesting peek into how our young people view the political system."
Boys State,94,90,audience,"Interesting, insightful, moves at a good pace. Really superb piece of documentary film making."
Boys State,94,90,audience,"A striking, if unsettling, looking at American politics boiled down to the microcosm of Texas' Boys State. The documentary is hard to watch at times, if only because it highlights the flaws and blemishes in our current political system, country, and citizens. Perhaps not a surprise that my biggest takeaway from this modern Lord of the Flies is that whoever yells the loudest usually wins."
Boys State,94,90,audience,A staggering portrait of today's political climate through the eyes of today's youth. Boys State serves as both a reflection and contemplation of where we are today as a nation and where we want to go.
Boys State,94,90,audience,"Uno de los documentales mas movidos que he visto, entretenido muy explicado para que se pueda entender que es lo que esta ocurriendo, e incluso a la vez tenso por las guerras de palabras que se forman en los debates y elecciones, es un documental inspirador y fenomenal"
Boys State,94,90,audience,I’ve never seen so many sad nerds in my life
Boys State,94,90,audience,These boys are at turns impressive and terrifying.
Boys State,94,90,audience,the American people will always and will be the power of the world. Years of advantage carry all of humanity. Doing a school of politics to train your youth is on another level. standing ovation.
Boys State,94,90,audience,Eye-opening and fascinating.
Boys State,94,90,audience,"Boys State is a compelling, enthralling documentary that serves as a deep look into the American political system. Each year the American Legion invites High School Juniors (17yos) to compete in mock government elections to learn more about the American political system. This has been occuring since 1937. This film focuses on the Texas Boys (there are Girls events too) event held last year in Austin. For 7 days about 1000 boys are selected and go through a mock campaign of devising political strategies and campaigning for various government roles with Governor being the highest office. The boys are split into two parties, Nationalist and Federalist. The film follows four boys in particular during this process. One of them is Steven Garza, of Mexican heritage who leans liberal. The others are definitely more conservative in nature, understandable in a state like Texas. The film is a microcosm of the political system which is both fascinating and scary. Young testosterone is flowing freely through out as the boys combat each other. Sadly abortion and gun rights seem to be the two main issues rather than issues like health and education. The film has a remarkable energy and it is quite gripping in its telling. As we build to the climax its very easy to be totally enthralled by the events taking place. They say the youth are our future and after watching this film this had me feeling both sad and hopeful in the same thought."
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
Boys State may have you alternately having hope or despair for the future of American politics, but the film is a master class in characterization. No matter where their lives take them, many of these boys seem to have what it takes to be leaders.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
It simply presents its material as straightforwardly as it can and lets us decide what to do with it.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
Their casting is remarkable, editing energizing, and conclusions authentically scary.

Jesse Moss makes finely observed, patient documentaries about self-deluded American conmen and dreamers. Naturally this leads him into politics.

A thoroughly depressing portrait of American teen masculinity, Texas politics, and the overall state of democracy...
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
There's a lot to be hopeful for in what they've included throughout Boys State even if the result makes the whole a two-steps forward, one-step back situation.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
The idea behind the program is to instruct these kids in the vagaries of politics, and the film in turn explores politics as practiced in the US today - so this is both a comedy and a horror movie.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
Cinema has been noticeably light recently on blockbuster spectacle, but the sight of this malleable young man learning about himself in real time as the camera rolls can feel as wondrous as any special effects.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
An expertly assembled fly-on-the-wall doc, this film follows teen boys through an exercise in which they create their own government.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
Boys State confirms that politics is not a spectator spot and definitely not for the weak. Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss provide an invigorating look into teen politics camp courtesy of the American Legion and Apple TV plus.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
It's compelling from the start to its heart-wrenching finish - an examination of young manhood and citizenship, and a reminder that we will choose what our democracy becomes.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
BOYS STATE illustrates the politics of persuasion both in method and substance. If anything, it demonstrates that those who seek actual change for the better... fight an uphill battle.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
Like a reality TV show cinema vérité.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
The experience is perfectly setting these kids up for what American democracy is -- it's about winning and losing, your party's success... Boys State, as a chronicle of this experience, accurately then also focuses on winning and losing.

Boys State,94,90,critic,"
To the extent the film serves a gorgeous and fascinating look at the machinations of male American teens, and how doomed they all are to repeat the idiotic mistakes of the ideological forebears? I'm absolutely buying.

Impeccably directed. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
Boys State is the political story of 2020, and that includes the on-going election. This is a honest look at a world many of us had no idea about, but you'll be hooked from the start.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
Some of the kids know manipulation is inevitable given what they associate politics with and the nature of Boys State. To see if they follow up on that very instinct or not is why this is a movie that is a must-watch.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
The topic isn't compelling enough to sustain a full-length documentary, most of the subjects come across as unlikable, entitled little brats, and co-directors McBaine and Moss seem to lack an understanding or willingness to follow the real story.
 "
Boys State,94,90,critic,"
The documentary about a political boot camp is a depressingly accurate microcosm of the American electoral circus...helpful-if only as a cautionary tale about what extracurriculars not to enroll your kids in.
 "
Ema,89,68,audience,"Pablo Larrain's new film opens with a hypnotic dance sequence intercutting with scenes that succinctly introduce us to Mariana Di Girolama's Ema, a dancer/teacher and her older husband/choreographer, Gael Garcia Brunel's Gaston. After an adoption that went horribly wrong causes a rift between them, Ema concocts a wildly ambitious plan that involves a lot of seduction and copulation to get the child back. This promising but fragmented and disorientating opening is well formulated and mesmerizing to look at but what follows unfortunately is the cinematic equivalent of a hot mess. Sergio Armstrong's striking and powerful cinematography is the best thing here, beautifully capturing a Valparaiso under attack from Ema's flame thrower and vividly staged dance sequences that's a feast for the eyes. However, the script and the way it was handled is alienating and horrendously inapt. Instead of settling down and unpacking the narrative in a watchable and convincing manner, the film continues irritatingly in that same fragmented and disorientating style all the way through. Motivations are confusing and unclear but her plan seems to hinge on one thing: that Ema can seduce and sleep with anyone of any gender. This conceit however is ludicrous and unsupported by how Ema looks and behaves, which is closer to a spoilt brat dressing up for Halloween as a sexy prostitute and missing the mark entirely. As a character study it tells us nothing profound or compelling and it criminally even makes the normally wonderful GGB looks dull and boring. The ridiculous and unintentionally laughable plot is something maybe an Almodovar can get away with but devoid of any wit, humour or coherency here, the film simply ends up falling gracelessly flat on its face."
Ema,89,68,audience,A super complex emotional journey that doesn't spoon feed you any one moral or emotional perspective as its story spirals further into ever weirder and wilder territory. A highly recommended break from typical Hollywood fare.
Ema,89,68,audience,"A beautiful film, stunning and engaging."
Ema,89,68,audience,"""Ema"" is pure art and music, one of the best movies of the year"
Ema,89,68,audience,Weird doesn't even begin to cover this one. It doesn't work all the time but the acting is good and it has sporadic moments of greatness.

 "
Ema,89,68,critic,"
It's a shame to see Larraín on slightly disappointing form, but there's something about this movie that seems a little too pleased with its own trickery.
 "
Ema,89,68,critic,"
This is, among other things, a vivid musical. So what if the story ultimately stretches credibility? Larrain is not bothered about social realism; his film is more like one of the heroine's balls of flame, hurtling towards our comfort zones.
 "
Ema,89,68,critic,"
Pyromania becomes performance art for [Ema]. The ceremonial destruction of public property becomes not only an empowering weapon to burn down the patriarchy, but also a ritual for cleansing pain so she can be free to claim a brighter future.
 "
Ema,89,68,critic,"
Fueled by a pulsating score by Nicolas Jaar and eye-popping visuals by Sergio Armstrong, Ema is a scathing character study of a woman dancing to the unmatched rhythm of her own chaos.
 "
Ema,89,68,critic,"
I don't think Ema is Larraín's best film, but the stylized handling of the mise-en-scène represents a twist on its aesthetics. It manages to captivate me with the stormy journey of that blonde battered by misery. [Full review in Spanish]

The Two Popes,89,88,audience,"The film is anchored by two powerful, chameleon like performances from two of the veterans of modern cinema, the pair proving extremely well matched as a pair of contradictory popes. Unfortunately, the film noticeably lags when the pair in question leave the screen."
The Two Popes,89,88,audience,"Very well acted, top quality movie. Hopkins and Pryce are superb."
The Two Popes,89,88,audience,"Good story, good documentary style history. Good drama with main character feeling regret for violent murder and torture of his friends after socialist/ communist take over. Etc. very well done."
The Two Popes,89,88,audience,"Although the acting was good, the movie was slow, stereotyped and inaccurate.  It's charming and funny in places, but too long for the content.  Rather than exploring the robustness of the characters, it relies on stereotyping the rigid German pope and the fun-loving Latin pope.  Finally it is inaccurate in many ways that diminish the audience's ability to really learn about these two men and to know why they led the church the way they did.  For example, Benedict is portrayed as hustling to get the necessary votes to become pope when all accounts tell that in fact, he was a man who wanted toe opposite.  He would have much preferred to keep the life of a Cardinal.  Changing these fundamental characteristics about the men, short changes the audience."
The Two Popes,89,88,audience,It was okay but at points so boring. Really had its lengths but I really loved the way it was filmed!
The Two Popes,89,88,audience,"Like The Crown, it was a moderately good quality, mostly held my interest and made me look up a bunch of stuff on Wikipedia afterwards. Some scenes brought a smile and a giggle."
The Two Popes,89,88,audience,"Movie raises some interesting issues in relation to the need for reform in the Roman Catholic Church. Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce are brilliant, as expected, but overall, the film is far too slow and repetitive."
The Two Popes,89,88,audience,Inaccurate and unfair portrait of Pope Benedict XVI/Ratzinger. Laughable to see how Pope Francis outspeaks a guy that is one of the all time greatest Catholic theologian and scholar.
The Two Popes,89,88,audience,This movie surprised me. I thought it was actually very interesting. The two different views of Christianity within the same circle. So many issues being dealt with. The relationship between them is also great!
The Two Popes,89,88,audience,In fact movie about nothing. Two stars for characterization.
The Two Popes,89,88,critic,"
Given the subject matter, solid filmmaking from a great director, and two stellar actors squaring off against each other, it's a good bet The Two Popes will garner plenty of accolades in the months to come.

The pleasure of The Two Popes is watching two very good actors create worlds with their monologues.

I'm strongly attracted to movies about real, true faith, because that necessarily involves conflict, struggle, and doubt.

Quietly riveting and unexpectedly lighthearted, the Two Popes presents two completely different men finding a middle ground, and in the process, a friendship.
 "

Anthony Hopkins plays doubt-ridden, conservative Pope Benedict XVI and Jonathan Pryce is Cardinal Bergoglio, his reluctant and progressive successor resulting in a masterclass in drama...

The Two Popes offers just enough wit and personality to see you through, doubtlessly thanks to the two exceptional performances at its centre.

It gives Catholics and non-Catholics alike some of the feelings that faith should provide.
 "

It is really beautifully acted, and a lot of times it does feel like a play on film in all the best ways.
 "
The Two Popes,89,88,critic,"
The script by Anthony McCarten is crisp and often amusing; director Fernando Meirelles does a fine job of basically taking what could have been a two-character, one-set stage play and opening it up with gorgeous sets.
 "
The Two Popes,89,88,critic,"
At its heart, The Two Popes is really about two old chaps, who just happen to be a Pope and a Pope-in-waiting, finding something liberating in an unexpected friendship. And what a blessing that story is. Don't miss it.

Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,audience,I can say that I’m glad I didn’t pay money to see this movie. Very “progressive” but just recycles plot lines and dialogue ad nauseam. Nothing really stood out as new or exciting. Not sure why this movie is rated so high. 
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,audience,This is the sequel to TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY that fans have been waiting for! Always great to see Linda Hamilton reprise her iconic role as Sarah Connor as well as Arnold as the Terminator. Some deaging technology is used early on in the film but I didn't find it as distracting as some other recent films. A great new addition in bringing Mackenzie Davis on board as can more than hold her own against anyone in her way. Lost some steam towards the end but a film that's enjoyable on the big screen for sure!
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,audience,"Despite what the movie may tell you, there are really 4 robots in Terminator: Dark Fate: Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T-800, Gabriel Lucas as the Rev-9, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, and Mackenzie Davis as Grace. Ironically, the acting in T6 is rather robotic, and while I can offer some grace to the veterans Schwarzenegger and Hamilton, Mackenzie Davis' deliveries were so cold and inexpressive that she didn't feel like a person, despite her many claims of being human. I did however really appreciate Natalia Reyes as Dani, who really tried to ground us with the humanity in her performance, sort of like John Conner in T2, but she's just not charismatic enough as a leading lady to carry a cast of 4 robots. Thankfully, the action in the movie is still decent, Mackenzie Davis performs fantastically in her action scenes and feels like an augmented warrior, and Arnold still packs the same steel strength in his strikes as he did in T2. But it seems like the franchise has run out of ideas to make terminators dangerous after T2, now every Terminator is a shapeshifting identity-stealing knife-hand wielding robot with a gimmick, and all the CGI involved in the action just makes none of it feel dangerous, despite the movie's R rating. The movie's script had major issues too(spoilers), first off, if you've seen the trailer, you've essentially watched the whole movie. The movie had one interesting 'twist' in the first 20 minutes, and then proceeds to be a cold, dumb action-fest for the next 1 hour and 40 minutes. Schwarzenegger's T-800 gets coldly rebooted for the 3rd time with just 4 lines and a ridiculous excuse for a backstory, thus we end up getting regrettably little of Arnold's classic acting over mindless CGI action. The relationship between Sarah and the T-800 is also just a poor rewrite of the exact same arc in T2, but with zero character development. And Dark Fate's plot also doesn't seem to have any direction besides running away from set piece to set piece; At least the Terminator: Genesis cast tried to kill Skynet, but not one of the 3 terminator killers in the Dark Fate thought about destroying the A.I. again? At the end of the day, Dark Fate only has two things going for it: Natalia Reye as Dani Ramos, and some classic Terminator on Terminator action."
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,audience,The greatest R-rated sequel ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,audience,"The characters or Sarah Conner and Grace are excellent and the Rev-9 terminator is a welcome change from the brutes of the past. But why, why, why did this movie do nothing more than repeat scenes from previous installments?
The character arc of Arnold's character is simply ridiculous. He made the franchise and nothing will change that but he had no place in this movie."
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,audience,"They were so busy with the cringy girl-power shtick, that they skipped out on plot. Never any explanation of the new 'judgment day', never any explanation of how an aging Sarah Connor can spend her days hunting terminators singlehandedly, not even an attempt to explain how a literal killing machine suddenly developed a conscience.
They also casually erase the entire pre-existing storyline.
One major plus: the action was pretty solid."
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,audience,Stop making these movies. You don't know what you're doing with it. Horrible characters. Terrible story. Even Arnold couldn't save it.
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,audience,This movie was just fun too watch. Miss that.
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,audience,"I was floored when I read this was a box office flop, and the reviews that made it sound like it was just another Terminator film. It was the 2nd best of all just after T2 if you can temporarily overlook the first being the first.

""...lacks the thrilling firepower of the franchise's best installments."" What!? It's one of the most action-packed movies I've ever seen, and everything was well-done and no corners seemed to have been cut.

I am a Terminator fanboy so take that into consideration, but it's one of the best action movies I've seen in a while."
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,audience,I take it anymore.........
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
If you can ignore the story mechanics and give in to the pure visceral nature of the film, it's an entertaining ride with a few great nostalgia kicks.
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
Terminator: Dark Fate is the best Terminator movie since T2 but feels more like a chance at setting up a new batch of sequels than a rebirth of the story.
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
For those of us keeping score, we are now 0-4 for modern Terminator sequels -- maybe it really is time to say goodbye.
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
It's good to see the old crew back together.
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
First and foremost, the decision to bring Sarah Connor back pays off big time. Linda Hamilton hasn't missed a beat as the world-weary warrior, and gets back to smashing metal mother[frick]ers to smithereens with aplomb.
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
Seeing Hamilton with the same sunglasses, the same inflexible visage, and a hoard of heavy weaponry is lightly nostalgic - but mostly meaningless.

The Terminator franchise looked a goner following 2015's botched and baffling reboot, Terminator Genisys, but this cracking new entry brings the sci-fi action thriller series thrillingly back to life.

Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
I love a good action film and dig a sustainable franchise. Terminator: Dark Fate really isn't either of those.

There's nothing to get massively excited over, and much of what occurs is entirely forgettable, but this is still the best Terminator movie since T2.
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
Photocopying what we've already seen, there's the industrial factory fight, the frenetic motorway pursuit and the cop shop massacre - here transplanted to US Border Patrol in what feels like half-hearted political commentary designed not to offend anyone.

 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
The film recaptures some of the old verve and delivers a straight-up admixture of AI fantasy and visceral action.
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
The story is clever and logical, presenting a world where Sarah didn't necessarily prevent Judgment Day, it just got delayed a good couple decades.
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
Easily the best ""Terminator"" movie in years. Make of that what you will.
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
It cherrypicks 'topical' concerns for a thin veneer of 'urgency' that liberally-minded critics lap up, but underneath is an endoskeleton of unpleasant and cynical opportunism swirling into the creative void.
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
After this redemptive film, Terminator execs are probably thinking: 'I'll be back.'
 "
Terminator: Dark Fate,70,82,critic,"
The good news is, director Tim Miller gets most of them right as he clearly understands that you don't have to overcomplicate matters by deconstructing the franchise's time-travel elements.

Flora and Ulysses,72,57,audience,"Flora and Ulysses is a rare live-action kids movie these days that mostly works. Yes, the second half featured a silly villain, typical family drama and an uninspired conclusion, but the first half is pretty good, especially the wonderful, funny and palpably energetic first act. Ulysses is an adorable squirrel and Flora is such an interesting child with an endearing mix of cynicism and imagination in her personality. The action could have been better, but the CGI is solid and the dialogue is actually quite good as is the humor."

Flora and Ulysses,72,57,audience,"well, i loved it.  i usually go to RT BEFORE  i watch a movie, but didn't this time because it seemed to be a riff on superheros, and since i started out my shop - DARK STAR BOOKS  AND COMICS - with the comic book part, i was as always thrilled to watch mainstream movies on the subject.  and then i checked the reviews on RT, and they SUCKED!  SO glad i didn't read them first, because if i had, i might have missed one of the most delightful movies of the season.

if i have a complaint - and hey! i ALWAYS have complaints - it is in my nature - it would be that the level of violence was a bit too high for the level the movie seemed to be at.  and i know i shouldn't end a sentence with ""at,"" but in my elder years, i don't care!  even so, awesome movie!"

I loved this movie and adore the young actress playing Flora. She is a gem. Adorable and grounded. She lights up the screen. And it's always a joy to see Alyson Hannigagan in anything."
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,audience,My kids and I loved this fun adaptation of Kate DiCamillo’s splendid book. It’s wacky and zany and HOLy BAGUMBA! It’s a lot of fun. It’s too bad it won’t get a theatrical release (thanks COVID-19 😕) but it’s still a keeper. 
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,audience,'Flora and Ulysses' is a hilarious yet heartwarming family film that is both touching and charming.
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,audience,I know it’s a kids movie but this was overboard cheesy. Not too entertaining and pretty dull. 
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,audience,"A smart kind of stupid. It's enjoyable, but also too gimmicky to do justice to its source material. The best part of the screenplay is the writerly voiceovers."
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
And yes, ""Flora & Ulysses"" certainly follows a predictable arc, but the style of storytelling immerses you into Flora's world, and we suspend all belief and just enjoy the ride.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
Built in the mode of ""Alexander's ... Very Bad Day,"" it's sweet, it's silly, it's wholesome and it boasts just the right amount of comforting predictability.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
Alyson Hannigan, Ben Schwartz and Matilda Lawler give delightfully funny performances in this film about the unexpected, love and loss.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
Flawed, but fun for the whole family, Flora & Ulysses has heart.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
It's sweet, and it's heart's in the right place.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
Overall, for all its pratfalls and fantasy, Flora & Ulysses tells kids some important truths.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
[A] very disarming and charming little film.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
Some times you can dumb things down too far. Disappointing but not completely damaging.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
This Disney+ release feels more like a merchandised product than any sort of creatively-crafted creation.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
A charmer with cross-generational appeal.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
Not an all-timer, but a pretty darned good diversion. If nothing else, it's a welcome reminder to the youngsters out there that heroes come in all types of package - big and small.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
While this movie is made specifically for children, it's very well done and adults will find some fun in it too. Charming story, solid VFX and Matilda Lawler is a great find.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
Furry Superhero Squirrels left me with hope and joy while being elated over Hollywood's newest little leading lady - Matilda Lawler. So much fun for adults and kids alike.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
There's a lot of slapstick and broad humor that saps ""Flora & Ulysses"" of much of its heart.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
While a little dark and a little unsteady, Flora & Ulysses still hits most of the right beats and manages to find some resonant, intelligent things to say.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
It's one of those family movies that are kind of cute to watch if you have a kid to entertain, but otherwise there's no reason for an adult to watch it.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
A wonderfully charming flick for the kids - but with its deeply existential nature, brimming with heart, super heroics and Disney Magic it's one that has so much to offer for even the oldest in the family.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
Fairly typical second-tier Disney, complete with most of the annoyances attributed to such a thing, but it also demonstrates a decent amount of charm and spirit.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
With Lawler commanding her scenes - her dynamic with Hannigan and Schwartz sparkles - Flora & Ulysses sometimes transcends its bland hijinks into cute and heartwarming family dynamics.
 "
Flora and Ulysses,72,57,critic,"
This Disney film surprises and mostly delights veering off the well-worn path of simple kid flicks into a furry, funny, squirrelly superhero quest. Flora Buckman, played by Matilda Lawler is at turns cute, yet cynical.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,audience,"It looks and feels like something taken out from a children's book. With some peculiar, beautiful animation, this folk, mystical tale will comfort and entertain the whole family with a predictable, yet enjoyable story, and with its unique charm and warmth. 

*I needed to get this out there... if Game of Thrones had a PG animated spin-off, this would be close to it."
Wolfwalkers,99,100,audience,The best animated movie of the year and one of the all time greatest
Wolfwalkers,99,100,audience,The greatest cartoon movie for families since Disney-Pixar's Soul!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wolfwalkers,99,100,audience,"Wolfwalkers may not have that same spark as song of the sea, but a better story and plot and plot twist."
Wolfwalkers,99,100,audience,"Exciting, but formulaic."
Wolfwalkers,99,100,audience,"As a true woof lover, I was enchanted by the story of beautiful girl-to-woof transformations and the magical qualities and tender spirit of the wolves in the woods. What really shit all over the story for me was the absolutely mean, overt brutality, the thuggish ignorance drawn cartoonishly one-dimensionally with ZERO nuance as if we needed to be hit on the head over and over and OVER again with the same themes: Dad is a clueless unseeing moron, the Lord Protector is just an evil lout who could really not be any more one-dimensional as an arch-villain, and etc. WTF? ""The charm of wood cuts and Celtic tapestries"" and absolutely wretched character development of all but the two main characters, Mebh and Robyn. Just horrible. If you are going to show cruelty and abject ignorance and horror, you have a responsibility to show some sense of humanity, lest the story turn into just that, nothing more than a gaillo horror show."
Wolfwalkers,99,100,audience,"Cartoon Saloon hits another movie out the ballpark, but with such beauty and style. Wolfwalkers might be one of the reasons why the Ireland studio should be one of the top dogs with Disney and Pixar. With the beautiful animation and style like The Thief and the Cobbler, (Richard Williams' Scenes) A original three act structure like Lord of the Rings but inspiring by Irish Folklore, and characters that you will love and remember even if the film is over. Congrats to Tomm Moore (Thanks for following me on Twitter) and Ross Stewart for making one of the best animated films that I've seen in a while. This and Klaus might bring a new age to hand-drawn animation. Hopefully, Cartoon Saloon will finally win that Oscar!

10/10"
Wolfwalkers,99,100,audience,"As someone who was lucky enough to actually be a child during the time of the great Disney animation renaissance of the nineties, hand-drawn films will always hold a special place in my heart. I and my whole generation were spoiled by perfectly put-together movie-musicals that were each as distinct in their visual stylings as they were in the genre that encompassed their musical numbers. Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart's Wolfwalkers may not be as much of an out and out musical as those Mouse House offerings that built my adolescence were, but it is very much a prime example of not only animation, but pure filmmaking that is firing on all cylinders. Offering the same warmth that surrounds me whenever I watch something like Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, or Beauty and the Beast I was immediately taken not only with how entranced I became in the mythology of the story told in Wolfwalkers, but how I was instantly welcomed into this world with no desire whatsoever to leave."
Wolfwalkers,99,100,audience,"Hands down supremely the best animated film of the strained year 2020 – as well setting up the challenging high bar for the decade's inviting medium and a rejuvenated reminder over the style's still magical effect of adoring yet unfortunately forgotten entertainment value. The supposable finale capping masterful storyteller Tomm Moore's Irish Folklore Trilogy proved that the films have grown off of each other artfully becoming more soulfully beautiful, stylishly complex and acceptable engagement blossoming towards adoration in response to a picture that is so lovely, felt through the charming, emotional performances and the music spiriting within a wonderfully reminiscing animation where all the involved hearts were put into like how the healing spells are enchanted in this film. (A+)"
Wolfwalkers,99,100,audience,"Ame esta película, una prueba más de que la animación 2d aun no a muerto"
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
Just sit back and enjoy, because this is not just a delightful film but an important one.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
With animation that eschews Pixar realism for the stylized beauty of woodblock prints, Medieval tapestries, illuminated manuscripts and Celtic patterns, the latest Cartoon Saloon stunner offers a rejuvenating balm for hungry eyes and weary souls.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
While many might feel compelled to title this a children's movie, and perhaps it does appeal to that audience, this particular film is one that transcends ages.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
A beautiful hand-drawn story of superstition and magic.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
Its sense of character expression and use of color and detail make it continually dazzling to watch.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
It's endlessly beguiling, like the magic of the forest, making for a film that whole families will want to watch again and again.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
A creative and narrative tidal wave. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
The story is compelling and the characters are interesting. The animation is colorful, like the other films in this Irish trilogy. It is a highly stylized throwback to the look of traditional hand-drawn animation.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
Its spell is irresistible.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
Here is an animated film that finds new beauty in ancient traditions; a film that fights back against the temptation to surrender what little magic this world still has left, and fulfills Cartoon Saloon's promise along the way.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
It really does feel, even as you're watching it, like you've uncovered a beloved treasure. It's that good.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
Wolfwalkers is a piece of work that feels almost timeless ...
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
Wolfwalkers never feels like an experimental movie, but when you hit that pause button, the magic of these decisions leave you gobsmacked.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
At its core, the film carries on a distinctly frank conversation about the horrors of a Puritan society and why it's good to evolve past a ruling class that manipulates its citizens.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
In the second half, I found myself unsure of how this would play out, giving me a good sense of danger and anxiety. This is what I wanted...and I was continually fascinated by the animation and the art style.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
Very sincere...the best of both Disney and Studio Ghibli films...
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
For younger viewers, this could be one of the early animation experiences they never forget.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
...gorgeously drawn, a visual spectacle with several important messages and a memorable score and soundtrack that will leave anyone howling for days.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
The film might be a tad long and it might be a skosh scary for really wee ones, but it fights for wolves and for girls with admirable animation.
 "
Wolfwalkers,99,100,critic,"
This gorgeous, impressive animated feature will take you back to the glory days of 2d animation.

Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,audience,"This was a lot of fun to watch! I really enjoyed that it reminded me of or included references to musicals like Hamilton, Rent, Annie, Mamma Mia, Hairspray, Phantom of the Opera, and The Little Mermaid and movies such as The Greatest Showman, Toy Story, Harry Potter, The Wizard of Oz, Mary Poppins, Peter Pan, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Hugo, The Santa Clause, Elf, The Polar Express, The Notebook, Star Wars, Wall-E, E.T., and Frozen.

The music/score is fantastic, the cast is great, costumes are super creative, and it is such a magical, heartwarming, uplifting story!"
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,audience,"his film has the ability to become a holliday classic, but if not, it will be memorable for the music alone. Definitely check this movie out, and be ready to dance and feel the music!

Full analysis - https://backseatdirectors.com/2020/12/review-jingle-jangle-a-christmas-journey/"
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,audience,"Like Polar Express, Jingle Jangle doesn't have much of an ethos other than promoting the general concept of ""belief."" Unlike Polar Express, it's a gorgeous, gregarious, moving, and well-animated Christmas musical. Mills and Whitaker are lovely, and their chemistry is funny and sweet. A fun Hugo-esque Netflix diversion that's SO much better than the Christmas Chronicle movies."
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,audience,"The musical numbers didn't mesh with the story, the characters actions didn't make sense. Overall, this movie is just too long and boring"
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,audience,Loved the music. The flying was a bit much. Didn't like the creepy woman.
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,audience,"Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Story is a fairly generic film that tries too much on cliches. The cast is decent enough. Keegan-Michael Key is definitely the standout. The film looks nice. The dance sequences work well, and I liked the production design. But the story is very predictable. It’s dragged out for two hours, and you can predict everything that happens. I would be fine with that if the emotion felt genuine but it honestly didn’t. The songs are hit and miss, and give off a Greatest Showman vibe (not in a good way). This was worse than that film in my opinion. Overall, this didn’t do much for me. There are plenty of other better Christmas films out there, and I recommend watching those instead of this. "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,audience,"It's worth watching, even if disjointed. It begins to explore really fun themes and thoughts but doesn't do much with them (math and metaphysical meeting) but generally offers viewers a look at diversity rarely seen in cinema, and it's a shame that it is so rare."
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,audience,"By the time you get into the second hour you wonder what is going on.  The story is not cohesive and wanders somewhat aimlessly.  The sets are really nice and Don Juan is funny, it could have been a really good movie, but it feels like the writers just ran out of steam.  Couldn't watch it through to the end."
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,audience,"This movie ranks as a must watch for the holidays, fun and festive, perfect blend of musical and holiday classic. Loved it"
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,audience,Such a cute movie!!!
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
It's a magical film. There are a lot of really feel-good moments between these characters, small touches with musical numbers...little things I really appreciated.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
So much of it either didn't make sense / contradicted itself, or felt like it was written on the fly to pass time...
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
...Jingle Jangle is a bold and imaginative throwback to the classic Christmas tales of our childhood with a modern perspective...
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey is a vibrant homage to old-school musicals while managing to have timeless, not outdated, qualities ... [The movie] is mostly a sweet-natured tale of how love ... can sustain families through the hardest times.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey is one of those holiday films that are easy to watch, make you happy, and give you just that little bit of Christmas/Holiday spirit.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
You'll forget most of what happened in the plot within just a few minutes of the credits rolling, but the cheer it offers is likely to last longer.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
This is awful, but to be fair, I don't like musicals...
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
This isn't for me, necessarily...I did appreciate this movie for what it was and what it represents to young kids today...
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
Like the best Christmas stories, it will be passed down from generation to generation, whether on Netflix or DVD, as something to get families into the holiday spirit.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
Full of sparkles, singing and lots and lots of beautiful plaid, the John Legend-produced confection is - despite the aforementioned singing - not as cheesy as you might expect.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
Remove the pigeon-holing label to welcome a new holiday favorite worthy of elated appreciation from any viewer.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
A film like Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey makes a strong case for being added to your festive rotation.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
This shiny, empty-headed musical bauble doesn't cut the mustard, pleasantly-forgettable songs notwithstanding.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
...this is a seasonal treat for all ages that really lifts the spirits in every scene.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
In its glorious extravagance, and its cheerful disinterest in apologizing for same, Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey captures a certain essence of the Christmas spirit.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
It is an instant classic with its bright and dazzling production, and equally brilliant cast. It is a feel-good story with real heart and emotion, and something to offer viewers young and old.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
A sprawling musical extravaganza whose candy-colored, dandily overstuffed revelry spills over with joy and jubilance and every other happy J-word.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
Overall, the idea of the movie is great and the set design along with the costuming is phenomenal. If you have small kids then they will enjoy it, however, has an adult this isn't gonna transport you to childhood or make you believe.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
Jingle Jangle isn't perfect - its plot holds few surprises and its tone is uneven - but succeeds, nonetheless, as an entertaining and good-natured fairy tale that should delight viewers of all ages.
 "
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,89,72,critic,"
Jingle Jangle is better than a lot of Christmas movies out there. Netflix have done an incredible job in creating an inclusive film full of wonder, magic, and joy.

Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
Concrete Cowboy introduces us to Urban Black Cowboys. Concrete Cowboys honors the tradition of those clubs while intertwining the father and son story.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
The innate promise makes Concrete Cowboy's inconsistent delivery frustrating to endure.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
Concrete Cowboy embeds a fairly ordinary coming-of-age story within this fascinating subculture
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
It has its value but the good intentions, a handful of tender moments, and a closing-credits sequence that feels worthy of its own documentary-feature, are not enough to make Concrete Cowboy feel essential.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
Concrete Cowboy is an example of the diverse and varied stories of Black lives in America.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
The overarching plot of this drama seems very paint-by-numbers, but the setting and underlying themes keep the film feeling fresh, and the central performance from Caleb McLaughlin keeps it engaging.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
A vibrant story that celebrates a fascinating real-life community. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
This very endearing father/son drama is as emotionally powerful as The Great Santini and as respectful to Black cowboy culture as Miss Juneteenth.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
""Cowboy"" is watchable, well-acted, occasionally moving. It's also overly predictable and never transcends the tropes of the standard coming-of-age drama.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
We know how things will pan out, of course. But there's freshness in the way Concrete Cowboy is written.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
The documentarian aspect of Concrete Cowboy is, at times, engrossing. Unfortunately, it suffers from being background to a rather generic and aloof coming-of-age story that is the film's center.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
Technically and narrative-wise, this bold story is let down by impoverished filmmaking.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
It's safe to say that the reason I enjoyed this so much is because of how delightful the film looks. Concrete Cowboy's urban Philadelphia setting is fantastically captured.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
Concrete Cowboy is an acknowledgment, reclamation, and tribute to a long lineage of Black frontiersman that's largely been swept under the rug. Sure, it may feel familiar, but sometimes, familiar feels good.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
It manages to capture the magic of the Fleet Street Stables while announcing to the world that McLaughlin is ready to stride out of an ensemble and into the spotlight.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
Though it may not possess the most inspired screenplay, Concrete Cowboy serves as a promising directorial debut.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
Teary and as mentioned a tad too far, but in all an appealing family film.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
So yeah, it's a little corny at times, but it looks good and has heart-and, let's be honest, Black cowboys are pretty damn cool.
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
Idris Elba never made Urban Cowboys look so good in this historically rooted tale of community masked as a coming of age story for Caleb M
 "
Concrete Cowboy,77,,critic,"
What follows is a combination of father-son bonding and beautifully horsey drama.

Enola Holmes,91,70,audience,"For me, it wasn't more than a family fun ride that my thirteen-year-old nieces would've enjoyed (at least more than I did). Let me be honest, I'm not a fan of the whole Sherlock Holmes' world. I don't know what it is that I can't finish liking it. Loved the production and, wasn't that the Hogwarts Express?!"
Enola Holmes,91,70,audience,"I loved the movie and honestly, I am waiting on a second movie it was so good. I loved the characters, the plot, and the excitement. I recommend people to watch this movie. I was so intrigued that I started reading the Sherlock Holmes books. I started with the first novel A Study in Scarlet. You must watch this movie. I'm going to rate this on every website it's so underrated. Please watch this I am begging you. No offenses to Milly Bobby Brown. I didn't like Stranger things, but this was a masterpiece of what she did. No offense once again. This is an awesome movie. I want to see more of the sister Eurus and Enola"
Enola Holmes,91,70,audience,"I loved it because it was so awesome to see a young woman play such an important character and the fact that she seemed to be a better detective than her older brother is inspiring.
Phoebe xx"
Enola Holmes,91,70,audience,"Well... I didn't like this movie. I absolutely hated the ""breaking the fourth wall moments"". The acting is fine and so is most of the action. It's also cringy sometimes. But overall I sadly do not recommend this movie."
Enola Holmes,91,70,audience,"Honestly, I didn't love Henry Cavill as Sherlock, but really enjoyed Millie Bobby Brown as Enola!"
Enola Holmes,91,70,audience,"The mystery is nonexistent and the characterization formulaic. Utterly predictable from first to last. Constant attempts to be quirky by breaking the fourth wall and so forth really rubbed me the wrong way. I must give this points for enthusiasm, but can't for much else. Brown does alright, but Partridge is insufferable. Not the right direction for the universe of Sherlock Holmes for me. I've also heard negative reactions to the hair and makeup (not my area of expertise) that add to the feeling that the filmmakers forsook any kind of respect for the source material in order to create a feminist film."
Enola Holmes,91,70,audience,"It was cute. Kudos to Millie Bobby Brown for being so talented  17. However, the breaking through the fourth wall was annoying."
Enola Holmes,91,70,audience,"Did you know that Sherlock Holmes had a younger sister?  That's the take-off point for this story, and it's an enjoyable one.  With some twists and turns, this story ends up in a good place, with some resolution, but also some questions.  In this case, the questions add to the enjoyment."
Enola Holmes,91,70,audience,"It will surprise you! The most brilliant performance by Millie Bobby Brown, in a wonderful and never banal movie. Excellent!"
Enola Holmes,91,70,audience,"The movie have a problems, first the four wall is break so horible, the movie have a lot things for kids, but the movie is not for kids, that reason, many things don´t have sense in the movie.
by the other hand, the actors play a very good role. by the script is to short for all the hype what propaganda do for the people."
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
A witty lead, exciting mysteries, and Edwardian England; who could resist Enola Holmes? Certainly not me.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
While it loses a little steam as it goes, Enola Holmes is a lovely, well-made and family-friendly slice of entertainment that benefits from a fun performance by Brown.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
I found Enola Holmes to be a step in the right direction for an entertaining, and even enlightening take on a promising franchise.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
While the mystery might be elementary (my dear, notably absent, Watson), the storytelling is winkingly subversive, proclaiming that a new and welcome game is afoot.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
It's stylish, playful, epic, and incredibly fun.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
For anyone looking for a fun, mindless mystery carried by a character they wouldn't mind seeing again, the story of the much cooler Holmes sibling is absolutely the way to go.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
With plenty of conspiracies and clue-solving in a brisk and engaging story, all cut to Daniel Pemberton's rousing score, it's a hugely entertaining romp that will bring out the sleuth in you.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
From Nancy Drew to Harriet The Spy to Veronica Mars, there is a wonderful tradition of young female detectives that Netflix's new film builds on, and it's great to see it carry on.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
Perhaps one too many breaks of the fourth wall but on the whole, Enola is a delightful little movie that has the potential to be a franchise launching point.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
Enola Holmes is a lark of a film that might have the possibility of becoming a mini-franchise for Netflix. Brown is the clear winner of the film, as she embodies everything the character needs to be.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
Enola Holmes is a very worthy addition to the Sherlock Holmes canon.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
Most importantly for this moment in our lives, Enola Holmes is just a pleasant time.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
Enola Holmes vibrantly does justice to the mystery book series for which it is named, thanks to a splendid cast and a twist-filled, engaging adventure that will leave viewers wanting more Enola Holmes movies.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
Leans hard into the idea that the turn of the century will usher in an era of reform. This is, of course, at odds with reality as well as the fin de siècle thinking of the time.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
Sam Claflin and Henry Cavill make great turns as Mycroft and Sherlock respectively, but the film's success lies entirely with [Millie Bobbie] Brown...
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
All florid, wild nonsense that feels like it's being played at 75% speed.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
Millie Bobby Brown is a star and Enola Holmes really highlights her talent. Can we get a trilogy of these movies, please?
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
It's clear that both character and actress are having an equally good time.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
Buoyant and precocious without being even slightly annoying, Brown has pinpoint comic timing, infectious perk, and a wholesome, tomboyish aura: imagine a young Keira Knightley crossed with Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
 "
Enola Holmes,91,70,critic,"
Enola Holmes tries to do a lot, with a story that has no need for political subplots that would completely go over the head of its Young Adult audience.
 "
Artemis Fowl,8,20,audience,"If I could give this movie negative stars, I would. They completely changed the story and usurped the name of Artemis Fowl. I hate it so much, they did a horrible job. Please do not watch this movie or give it more money. I hope you're proud Disney, I hope this movie burns in the fiery pits of hades for all eternity. They completely changed the premise. Artemis IS NOT the good guy, he is an anti-hero who has to gain his morals throughout the series. Do not claim you made an Artemis Fowl movie, all you have done is ruin childhoods and misrepresent a wonderful story. You didn't 'make it palatable to younger audiences' you made a different story, with different characters. Though I do admit the designs for haven and Fowl manor were quite lovely, you still completely changed a story that was already wonderful and full of a diverse cast, also you made Holly white. Holly is described as having ""nut-brown skin"" that's whitewashing. I have so many problems with this film and could go on for pages, But I won't subject any readers to that. But please don't watch this movie. Its such a dissapointment."
Artemis Fowl,8,20,audience,"One thing I have to say about it, worst movie of 2020."
Artemis Fowl,8,20,audience,"The acting was laughable. I can't believe they produced, shot, edited and still let this film hit the ""theaters""."
Artemis Fowl,8,20,audience,"This movie is the the worst Disney movie I have ever experienced by a long shot, nothing makes sense. Every minute of the movie I find another glaring plot hole in this mess of a film. If you have find yourself with some spare time don't spend it watching this disaster of a movie adaption."
Artemis Fowl,8,20,audience,"OMIGOD!!!! ITS SOOO AWFUL
ITS NOTHING LIKE THE BOOK EXCEPT THE NAMES 
OH AND BTW 
ARTEMIS WOULDNT BE CAUGHT DEAD IN A TSHIRT AND JEANS"
Artemis Fowl,8,20,audience,The movie was a good start for more movies of the kind. It doesn't do a good job of being a stand alone movie though. It is however decent and worth a watch.
Artemis Fowl,8,20,audience,"I haven't read any of the other reviews, and I had never heard of this movie prior to my 12 year old daughter wanting to watch it for the second time.  It has creepy voices and some characters, but over all this is age appropriate for 12+ or earlier that have experienced worse.

In my opinion, this movie is worth 4 if not 5 stars.  I'm a fan.  I could go into the nuances and character building (Holly, Olaf) and fantasy story line....  Wow.  Great movie, I highly recommend!"
Artemis Fowl,8,20,audience,When watching I wondered if the director even read the books. This movie was one of the worst book to movie adaptations ever.
Artemis Fowl,8,20,audience,"Movie is fun and a little silly, but entertaining. Also, for children."
Artemis Fowl,8,20,audience,good work by the actors but the film was horrendous 
Artemis Fowl,8,20,critic,"
Artemis Fowl appears to be a film drenched in production issues, phoned-in performances, and a really shoddy script that fails to adapt even the simplest elements from the books.
 "
Artemis Fowl,8,20,critic,"
Unfortunately, Artemis Fowl joins The Lightning Thief and The Golden Compass in the camp of YA series done dirty by their film adaptations.
 "
Artemis Fowl,8,20,critic,"
Artemis Fowl may survive to have more on-screen adventures, perhaps filling the hole for fantasy fans left by the absence of Harry Potter movies, but next time around fewer special effects and more personality would help.

The fact that this film has a young Black female character whose sole narrative purpose is to bring people sandwiches should tell you everything you need to know about it.

Disney continues to try desperately to find their fantasy-inspired franchise and this, decisively, isn't it.
 "
Artemis Fowl,8,20,critic,"
A particularly vulgar Harry Potter rip-off that tries to hide the worst of its theft by mashing it into the framework of Men in Black.

The mischievous glint in [Judi Dench]'s eyes is Artemis Fowl's only nod to irony and self-awareness.
 "
Artemis Fowl,8,20,critic,"
Artemis Fowl is a mediocre mess of a film that clearly spent a lot of time on visual effects but not enough time in doing justice to the kind of storytelling that author Eoin Colfer has in his Artemis Fowl books.
 "
Artemis Fowl,8,20,critic,"
With equal doses of sci-fi and fantasy,"" Artemis Fowl"" plays like a mashup of ""Star Wars"" and ""Harry Potter.""
 "
Artemis Fowl,8,20,critic,"
A bland, unexciting family fantasy of the kind we've come to expect from Disney originals. It's completely devoid of charm, or any Disney magic... Disney made a wise decision to dump this on their streamer, where it certainly belongs.
 "
Artemis Fowl,8,20,critic,"
If you read the books, you may find the filmmakers chopped out too much. If you haven't read the books, you'll almost certainly find it chaotic, confusing and hard to follow.
 "

Artemis Fowl is a bumpy, rudderless ride despite the fact that its runtime is only 95 minutes.

Reminiscent of everything and better than nothing.

Lacking in vivid characters, compelling stakes or memorable set pieces, Walt Disney Artemis Fowl brings to mind the very worst of the post-Harry Potter attempts at young adult fantasy franchises.

Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,audience,"Very fun movie that is fun for the entire family. Sounded cliché, but it is true. Fun for adults as well, some silly humor but it works. Good performance by Jim Carrey, just a fun movie. Bonus points for adults who remember the early SEGA/Nintendo games."
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,audience,"I don't know how, I don't know why, but this movie was great"
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,audience,They manage to hit every single kids joke cliché. Did the writers even try?
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,audience,"This is a very underrated movie in my opinion, Sonic meets all the requirements to be one of the best movies about a video game, originality and fun are in every corner of the movie and that makes the viewer want to continue watching it. Jim Carrey makes him great and makes a good, funny villain. The visual effects are wonderful, how they adapt Sonic is well done and that detail of Sonic in Goku mode is very well done."
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,audience,This movie was fun. I was looking for something to pass the time and this was it. I enjoyed watching a teenager experience life.
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,audience,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it would look bad, well I was so, so wrong. Sonic the hedgehog is a great return for Jim carry, a great message, and a great plot."
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,audience,this movie was very good and very fun
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,audience,"I'll give the studio this much, they listened to the audience when the first trailer dropped and changed the appearance of Sonic due to the fan backlash. They should have had more screenings of this with test audiences because this was a train wreck of a film. Rated PG so as to appease to a wider market and trying to establish a franchise, but the script writers seemed on a mission to make this a one and done. Bad jokes (even with a theater full of children and parents, no one was hardly laughing), pointless scenes that at times did little to nothing to further the storyline (for example, a creepy Jim Carrey dance sequence), and of course, a rip off of the Quicksilver slo-mo scene from X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST and X-MEN: APOCALYPSE. Not to mention shameless product placement of a certain Italian restaurant chain. Avoid this film at all times!"
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,audience,several product placements 
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,audience,"Sonic the Hedgehog was a better movie than it had any right to be. Formulaic and cheesy, but Sonic is a fun character and James Marsden gives his role way more effort than a movie called ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" deserves.

I laughed a lot, but ultimately, the thing that held me back from liking this more was...Jim Carrey's performance.

I counted one laugh due to the writing on a line and 2 based on his delivery (one of which was immediately killed by him repeating the laugh line). How does anyone like this performance? He's trying to be both funny and intimidating, but the former doesn't work at all and the latter is constantly undermined by the former. The worst part is, if the director had known what to do with him, he could have been the best part of the movie, instead of the biggest downside.

The biggest downside other than that horrible Zillow product placement, that is. I need counseling after that."
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
Sonic the Hedgehog is just good enough where we wouldn't mind a second dashing adventure in the not-to-distant future.
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
Sonic the Hedgehog is a much better movie than expected, and if they deliver anything near this level the next time around, moviegoers will have much to cheer.
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
Sonic is a surprisingly fully realized character trapped in a two-dimensional film.
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
Sonic's fan will broadly approve. Family audiences will enjoy it and forget it. Anyone with a specific interest in cinema already know what they are likely to think.
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
Overall it's not a family film that will wow you with originality, but it is one that will entertain all audiences watching, including fans of the original gaming franchise.
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
the kind of film you don't necessarily mind spending 90 minutes with, but it's also not necessarily a 90 minutes you would ever acknowledge publicly that you enjoyed
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
A tedious and entirely predictable film that in spite of its super-sonic hedgehog lead manages to feel dull and slow. A wasted Jim Carey fails to save a movie in which none of the characters inspires any sympathy.

With a facelift applied to his CGI visage after a disastrously received trailer, Sonic has arrived in a refreshing burst of kinetic energy and charm.

Hoping to capitalise on the wave of nostalgia around vintage video games, Paramount delivers a feature-length commercial to sell Sonic the Hedgehog merchandise to kids.
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
As the credits roll, you may leave with an amused smile, but not the emotional surge to cheer for time well spent. Don't hold your breath for Sonic's sidekick Tails to appear. You'll likely have to wait for the sequel in ""Sonic 2.""
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
Children younger than the age of 10 will probably enjoy Sonic the Hedgehog the most, but everyone else will have to sit through the same recycled tropes that have been seen many times before in TV cartoons over the years.
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
The film had such little effect on me that the biggest response I can muster is to shrug my shoulders and say 'meh, it was ok.'
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
Adults, even an aged millennial, should get a kick out of seeing Carrey actually have fun in a role for the first time in years. He taps into all his old manic energy here.
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
A slow road-trip is not what's fun about Sonic.
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
Sonic the Hedgehog is a fun and entertaining ride for all to enjoy. It found a way to make itself open to both lovers of the video game franchise and newcomers. The humans were unnecessary, save for Jim Carrey, but a sequel will hopefully improve that.
 "
Sonic the Hedgehog,63,93,critic,"
As someone with no nostalgia for Sonic it's just ""fine."" It only insulted my intelligence a handful of times at the end of the day.

Cats,19,53,audience,"Look, I'm a fan of the musical, but I don't think I could EVER finish talking about how much I hate this movie"
Cats,19,53,audience,Best movie ever. Would be one star if the hottie james corden wasn't in it.
Cats,19,53,audience,"I've never done psychedelics, but I imagine this is what you experience when you do take them. It's the worst fever dream I've ever had the displeasure of being tortured by."
Cats,19,53,audience,"Leave Cats alone. Despite the somewhat jarring appearance of the Cats, Cats is a fun movie and not a waste of your time. People went into the film with the mindset it was going to be bad and it shows, from it's undeserved low rating. Worth watching."
Cats,19,53,audience,"From a theatre show perspective, the movie allows diverse environments and actions that are not possible in a normal theatre show production, but what's missing is conflict like gangster cat violence and how to ""magically defeat"" gangster violence without bloodshed and weapons. If I want to take Cats to the next level, the sequel Cats 2 would be multi-cultural, multi-talented like those from America's Got Talent to create a whole new multi-dimensional  circus side of cats on a global festival music scale from all continents: Asian, African, Polynesian, European etc."
Cats,19,53,audience,"Truly one of the worst movie adaptations of a musical. This movie is quite a nightmare. The musical Cats is actually very good, but this movie did everything wrong."

Cats,19,53,audience,"The worst piece of shit to have ever had the luck of gracing of screen, there was not one point where my acid trip was pleasant during the viewing process. I became susceptible to feelings such as nausea, discomfort, and my grandmother died shortly after. So unless you want your inheritance early or a waste of psychedelics, watch this film, if you don't enjoy pieces of shit in your tea, then don't waste your time"
Cats,19,53,critic,"
I want to tell you I at least had fun... but this movie is also so horrible it doesn't even earn the status to make fun of magicians.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
Watching the film version of Cats is truly mystifying, in neither a completely bad nor completely good way. Fans of the theater production may enjoy seeing their favorite songs or characters again, but there's little to recommend for anyone else.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
With actors who appear to have been put through the full-body Snapchat cat filter, a Ziegfeld Follies-style chorus line of dancing cockroaches and felines with human hands and feet, you'll wonder if the theatre popcorn is laced with catnip.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
I, for one, felt lost, grappling down a sketchy back alley for rhyme, reason and, once the credits rolled, the nearest exit.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
[The] stars must be coughing up hairballs after joining the film's giant litter of singing and dancing felines, whose weird digital fur and creepy features make them all look as though they've been dragged in from the Island of Dr Moreau.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
May be too indigestible even for a hate-watch.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
Enraging, unfathomable, and laughable, Cats is a masochistic experience, that this reviewer rather hesitantly recommends - if only for the gamut of emotions it will take you through, leaving you scratched all over.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
Cats is disjointed, unintentionally comical, and a little creepy - and folks, I love musicals.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
Cats may very well be the most unique film of the year, certainly released by a major studio, and you'll love it and hate it but you sure won't forget it.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
Dragging on for almost two hours of poor singing and predominantly forgettable choreography, Cats is Hooper's way of maliciously toying with us like a half-dead mouse wishing for sweet release.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
Add in the tonal shifts and performances that never feel like they're in the same movie, and out comes a cat scratch fever dream that can only be enjoyed ironically.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
Every ounce of goodwill built by the feline community in this economy of viral cat videos and memes has been squandered by a single movie.
 "
Cats,19,53,critic,"
This is like doing too much catnip and falling asleep to the soundtrack, just surreal. Your MEMORY of the story may change, but the curiosity to see it won't kill you. Hy-ooh!

There's no use crying over spilled milk. ... It's a boo hiss - unless you're insanely curious to witness something so awesomely bad. Just remember: curiosity killed the cat.

Cats might be an example that just because something can be done doesn't mean it should be, and that some titles are better left for the stage.

Last Christmas,46,81,audience,"This was a very corny and predictable plot . But with that being said I think this movie had good intentions and was enjoyable. I honestly didnt read to much into it and kind of switched off my brain to just enjoy it , and it was fun . Its a good light hearted christmas movie if not taken to seriously."
Last Christmas,46,81,audience,"It's definitely not what you'd expect.
It's way better."
Last Christmas,46,81,audience,Painful aggrovating and insulting I feel stupider for watching it.
Last Christmas,46,81,audience,"Better than expected thats for sure...I was not curious last year to see it but this here I wanted to give it a chance and was worth it...

Funny, emotional and a very good solid plot and twist...

Tom: ""There's no such thing as normal. It's a stupid word. Does a lot of damage."""
Last Christmas,46,81,audience,"A real feel good Chirstmas movie that will leave you with a tear and a smile.  

It's hard to say anything about the plot without giving away huge spoilers.  So I'll just say watch it. You'll be glad you did."
Last Christmas,46,81,audience,"It’s a fun Christmas flick with wonderful chemistry from the leads, a nice little narrative twist and a heartfelt message. Critics need to settle down, it’s not trying to be anything more than it is. If the trailer is your speed I think you’ll enjoy it just fine."
Last Christmas,46,81,audience,A limp romantic comedy.

Last Christmas,46,81,audience,"A decent Christmas movie, but not a good regular movie. Melodramatic."
Last Christmas,46,81,audience,"These crappy critics, it's a romantic Christmas comedy, they find it cliché, they find it unoriginal. I loved the humor and the overall goal of the film is to fill you with faith, a good attitude, and love of life. I think these critics lack that."
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
...a blot on the resumes of all concerned; like The Holiday, it's a festive ghost that will haunt and diminish the stars...
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
Last Christmas is like most holiday movies - something that makes you feel good in the moment, but destined to be forgotten before the year is done. Even the hook of a George Michael soundtrack can't make it last.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
As the film progresses, you can feel the twist waiting to drop ... You just don't know which rom-com cliche it's going to be. Turns out, it's all of them, and when it's revealed, it is very hard not to imagine Nora Ephron turning in her grave.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
Last Christmas wanders around listlessly, unmoored from laughs, almost as if it's been made as revenge against anyone who's complained about [Feig's] penchant for improv-based indulgences.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
Part Curtis-style rom-com, part George Michael jukebox movie (note the title), part personal redemption tale and part mystery story... Put all this together and it's no surprise that the movie is something of a mess.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
Clarke's first big post-Game of Thrones move is heavy on inclusivity and morality lessons but loses no sense of humour in the process, dodging preachiness with ease.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
It's worth seeing with family and girlfriends and moms and besties because it's a smart happy movie you can laugh with without feeling dumber for it.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
Last Christmas fortified my cynicism for more than an hour, then Clarke eroded it just enough to make me like it.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
Yeah it's predictable and a little formulaic, but Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are such a whimsical duo - delivering on the laughs and the tears.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
For all its unoriginality there is something inherently likeable in this fondue mess.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
I personally enjoy Emilia Clarke's spirited performance the most. She's clearly the scene-stealer here. The supporting cast is just as fine, particularly Michelle Yeoh and Emma Thompson as Emilia Clarke's Kate's boss Santa and Kate's mother Petra.

Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
It did not click... It's not Love Actually.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
Its heart was in the right place, it just wasn't there there.

Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
The combined charms of Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding do a lot to ground the film in a place that feels real and not too quirky.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
It's likely to become a Christmas classic, but for all the wrong reasons.
 "
Last Christmas,46,81,critic,"
A Hallmark movie mixed with the forgettable drama Seven Pounds.

Abominable,81,95,audience,"It is very cuuute. At first, I am not a fan of Yi's hair but as the movie went on, I didn't care that much anymore. It has a heart warming message too and the visuals are stunning. Although it had a backlash because of a 'MAP' that was on the first part of the film relating to some Chinese propaganda. Overall, enjoyable and a good film. I find myself to like Jin more as the movie goes on :)"
Abominable,81,95,audience,"Feel good family movie.  Unexpected wonder awe, adventures and finding family."
Abominable,81,95,audience,"Entertaining and emotionally engaging. But there were distracting plot holes in this otherwise enjoyable and beautifully animated film. How were the kids planning on getting home from Everest? It really never crossed their mind? Wouldn't the kids have trouble breathing up there? Wouldn't they have needed something other than t-shirts long before they reached the summit? Also, how long can a phone that's being constantly used in areas with poor cell service last? 

Also, the protagonist's epiphany about the importance of the women in her family left something to be desired. What exactly changed in her/their life after the experience with the Yeti?"
Abominable,81,95,audience,"Sweet movie and interesting, different."
Abominable,81,95,audience,Very cute movie. The only reason I give it four stars is because of “The bad guy isn’t actually the bad guy” twist. The twist could have been better that’s all. 
Abominable,81,95,audience,"Well made.  Nothing outstanding about the movie, and probably more targeted to the young viewer... but feel-good and nice visuals.  The characters are okay/a little typical- and kinda seems like a lot of animated movies where there are a number of relatable characters, and cute/marketable animals and characters.  Just an okay way to spend 90min- not as slick as some animated movies, and no jokes hidden for the adults in the audience."
Abominable,81,95,audience,"It's a cute movie, it has some cheesy dialogue but definitely lands in the animation department."
Abominable,81,95,audience,"Decent at best kids flick which felt more like a tourism video for China. Visually impressive sure, but the story itself was average. Felt like a rehash of so many stories before that featured a group of kids getting attached to a mythical creature or alien, getting them back to their home only to be chased down by the bad government guys. Yawn."
Abominable,81,95,audience,"A sweet little movie with a child friendly Yeti. Not as serious as a Pixar film but certainly has some enjoyable sequences. It’s not the most unique story ever told, but it is worth the adventure into the Himalayas"
Abominable,81,95,audience,"This movie is full of so many emotions from funny, sad, happy, excited, etc. The kids were so funny and the cute creature, was so adorable. Loved the storyline. One of my favorites. I’ve seen it twice. Second time by myself at the theater. A must see!"
Abominable,81,95,critic,"
Simple messages on grief, loss and perseverance (""When things get tough you just keep going,"" Yi says helpfully.) provide an emotional subtext but it's the film's light touch and visuals that pack the biggest punch.

Abominable,81,95,critic,"
Family doesn't have to mean father, mother, children and in-laws, sometimes there are missing people, so friends take up the slack, and even animals can be family members, especially large, white, furry ones. Abominable is fun entertainment.

There are plenty of worse ways to pass an hour and a half of viewing time -- you're just unlikely to want to do it twice.

The final result transcends any such conventions as its locale, character design, and wholesome messaging rise above to allow it to escape easy comparisons.

Abominable"" ends its journey with a shrug more than a sharp rallying cry. It's fine, but it's not a journey you'd necessarily want to repeat.
 "
Abominable,81,95,critic,"
Despite a hilarious running gag of goofy Whooping Snakes constantly popping up, Abominable doesn't hold the attention of its intended audience very long.
 "
Abominable,81,95,critic,"
There's something about the character design chosen by director and writer Jill Culton that doesn't really serve the story. They've made the young yeti into a cross between a slobbering St. Bernard, an albino pug, and polyvinyl chew toy.
 "
Sea Fever,87,46,audience,A pretty well done low budget indie sci-fi horror/thriller.
Sea Fever,87,46,audience,Meh...   Main character was not very realistic.  Plot kind of silly.
Sea Fever,87,46,audience,"I must have a soft spot for oceanic horror. One of my first ""top 10"" lists covered tropical horror (boxd.it/8YK4w). I guess I have Lovecraft to blame.

Sea Fever starts as a slow-burn with an ensemble cast that plays their roles as ""understated"" deep sea fishers but picks up the pace once they get stranded at sea.

The plot is convoluted and meanders a lot in the second half, but the overall concept is solid and significantly more entertaining than one of the other oceanic horror movies of 2020, The Beach House."
Sea Fever,87,46,audience,Nice LoveCraftian movie. Not so scary or suspenceful though
Sea Fever,87,46,audience,"If you like mass explosions, creature violence and extended action scenes this movie is not for you.  Sea Fever is a great small budget film that we don't get anymore from American cinema (hence this being an Irish film).  This movie will make you uneasy and might actually make you think.  I'm disheartened by all the negative audience reviews, although I'm not surprised.  If a movie doesn't have a superhero punching a bad guy and everyone winning in the end it's no longer considered a good movie.  I really hope to see more films like this in the future."
Sea Fever,87,46,audience,"Not terrible, but some of the decisions made in the film were just really dumb. Spoiler ahead... so if the lead girl were really concerned about humanity and spreading the parasite, why stop everyone from going to the hospital? Does she really think being a single grad student on a fishing boat she could figure out all of what is going on more than medical professionals? Anyway, it's basically The Thing on a boat with less monsters. It passed the time."
Sea Fever,87,46,audience,"The menace in Sea Fever is somewhere between the unknown threat of Alien and the paranoia-inducing infection of the Thing.  But Sea Fever is not derivative, tinged with its own unique flavor of Norse seafaring superstition.  Like Alien's Ripley, Siobhan is a smart heroine with nerves of steel, making her a compelling figure to combat this alien threat.  Unlike Ripley, Siobhan is not a military officer, but a research student - so don't go in expecting Siobhan to strap on an exosuit à la Aliens.  Overall, the claustrophobia and paranoia inherent to a small Irish fishing vessel makes it a perfect setting in which to build up tension, and if you give the film a chance, Sea Fever will surely take hold."
Sea Fever,87,46,audience,"Such a super hard oceanic sci-fi…gorgeous and deadly realistic.
This goes somewhere deeper than horror.  Personally I'd even consider positioning it as sci-fi drama and it works, it works beautifully.  It's an undersea sci-fi of the unknown monster kind.  But it is a slow burner - it feels like it beats a real-time kind of drum rather than that of nailing genre beats.  It's a European production, set on an Irish trawler helmed by Connie Neilsen playing Freya.  The accents are thick and refreshing."
Sea Fever,87,46,audience,Incredible performances and tone.
Sea Fever,87,46,audience,"This is more of an interesting sci-fi/drama kind of thing than a horror movie.  It owes a great debt to ALIEN, but while many of the story beats feel similar, it fails to actually get the pulse racing like ALIEN did.  But it's still an interesting film with some interesting characters.

We meet Siobhan, a marine biology student, as she is preparing to do a sort of ""ride along"" with a fishing trawler...doing some scientific experiences out on the ocean.  She's not there to help the crew, the ship owners are being paid to accomodate her.  And we learn early on that the two owners (Connie Nielsen and Dougray Scott) NEED the money.  Turns out, it's a good thing she's there, because before you know it, a mysterious deep sea creature has emerged and causes quite a bit of dangerous, even fatal, trouble for the ship's crew and only Siobhan's scientic knowledge is likely to help them find a way out.  

The creature, while not nearly as scary as the ALIEN, is good at hiding and then popping out at inconvenient times.  And this is really how the bulk of the movie plays out.  How will the crew find a way to survive while they slowly try to return to shore in their damaged craft?  The scenes of violence and attack are played out well enough, but there's nothing groundbreaking going on either.

What kept me interested in SEA FEVER were the characters.  Siobhan herself is interesting...prickly, introverted but really just eager to make some friendly human connections.  She is normally reticent to engage with strangers, but the close quarters force it.  And she finds some kindred spirits and a well of toughness.  Nielsen and particularly Scott are interesting as the owners.  They are very hard-up for money.  They are a couple that's been together for a long time, but still have a rough affection for each other that bubbles up through their anxiety.  And Scott has a deep and believable strain of religious faith that you seldom see portrayed with such relative casualness.  The supporting cast are generally well sketched, and the casting is very diverse, but without being distracting.  And I have to say that actress Olwen Fouere is an amazingly striking presence.  I hate to judge on appearance, but she is unique and amazing looking.  

So watching the dynamics of these characters is what makes this film interesting.  They pull together under unfortunate circumstances.  As a ""creature feature"", this film is less thrilling than one might like.  But as a richly realized but low key sci-fi thriller, it's pretty impressive, especially with its very low budget.  Worth a look, for sure."

During these germaphobic times, Sea Fever may get extra legs because of its timeliness, but that doesn't change what the film is at its core: well-crafted indie horror.

I watched Sea Fever [in the] morning, and by that night I noticed I'd hardly had any water to drink the entire day.

It is a human versus nature tale that doesn't always make the viewer fear the monster; instead, they are meant to grapple with what it means to share a world with such creatures.

A decent enough horror thriller, that shares some traits with a subgenre we don't see enough: deep sea horror. [Full review in Spanish].
 "
Sea Fever,87,46,critic,"
If you value a slow-burn horror of enclosed spaces and strange nature, where a large share of the horror derives from the vast, isolating expanses of the sea itself, then there is much to recommend Sea Fever.
 "
Sea Fever,87,46,critic,"
With interesting ideas, a solid cast, intriguing creature, and tight quarters, ""Sea Fever"" presents an often-taut genre narrative. But just as often, it fumbles when deciding what it is, what it wants to be, and where it's heading.
 "
Sea Fever,87,46,critic,"
It's a tried-and-true horror concept: a confined space and an unseen threat that leaves everyone wondering if they're infected. It's claustrophobic in all the right ways.
 "
Sea Fever,87,46,critic,"
In some ways, Sea Fever feels like the slightly prescient horror film of the time. A film about monstrous organisms and the unseen creatures that might be inside you.

he issue here is that everything from the characterization to the film's visual sensibility feels derivative of these references without inviting much new conversation

Blood Quantum,90,41,audience,"I never learn that this isn't really my genre... the excessive gore and the overly intense zombies (no fun or explosions)...  However, this movie was beautifully shot and had an intelligent & cultural tone about it.  Characters worth caring about, but as expected lots of deaths and not a lot of enjoyment... but blood."
Blood Quantum,90,41,audience,Boring. Don’t waste your time. 
Blood Quantum,90,41,audience,A tale of two movies. It starts like gangbusters: tight and exciting. The second half seems like everyone forgot how to act and the writer clearly lost his way.
Blood Quantum,90,41,audience,"The first half hour of this movie was so promising, before it began feeling more like another episode of 'The Walking Dead'...after the series stopped being good. I gave it an extra half-star for its original ""blood quantum"" concept."
Blood Quantum,90,41,audience,"The movie is overpraised for its First people's premise and cast; which could have been fascinating but after a good start, it's mostly wasted on a dull, cliched script and wooden performances across the board, with the possible exception of the Black Sheep son who is a cardboard villain. Sadly, this is not anything like the film it could have been; any Romero-esque satire on commentary on racism and imperialism is squandered, though it is vividly shot and the physical effects are very satisfying."
Blood Quantum,90,41,audience,"Kinda campy and cheesy, but a great Native story with nods to Tarantino and Romero"
Blood Quantum,90,41,audience,Boring and poorly acted zombie movie. Only good character is the grandpa. Was interesting when it was the beginning of the outbreak. But then of course they time jump six months and its typical zombie shit we've seen over and over.
Blood Quantum,90,41,audience,"Taking a cue from George Romero's social commentary-laced zombie classics, Blood Quantum is a decent riff on the zombie apocalypse on a native American reservation. Not sure what the heck the title means as it has no relevance to the movie."
Blood Quantum,90,41,audience,Nothing special and nothing that hasn't already been done.
Blood Quantum,90,41,audience,"2.5/5.  Blood Quantum has excellent gore and interesting ideas, but the scrip isn't great, the acting is mediocre, and it doesn't do enough with its concept."

Harriet,73,97,audience,"Good enough, just frustrating in terms of character development. Harriet Tubman goes from a wide-eyed, scared enslaved person lucky to spend even a moment outside the clutches of those looking to capture her to some kind of Messianic figure who can do no wrong in the ""freeing slaves network"". Not bad performances necessarily, but this gripe really brings down the film."
Harriet,73,97,audience,"First off, Cynthia Erivo is fantastic in the title role. The film transforms Harriet Tubman from an also-mentioned historical one-off, and shows us the incredible grit of this great American woman. It is a beautiful period piece, a joy to view. The story is mostly gripping and believable, but drifts too much into myth-building for my taste. But still, it is well worth watching, especially by those who wonder why Tubman deserves to be on the $20 bill."
Harriet,73,97,audience,Shows the strength of the human spirit. Very inspiring.
Harriet,73,97,audience,"Excellent all around movie or story on Harriett life, great view point and acting."
Harriet,73,97,audience,"Great movie. You definitely learn a lot about Harriet Tubman. Didn't know how religous she was. Sad that she was married to a free man but then escaped slavery and came back to him and he had remarried in part because he thought she died, but he also didn't want his children to be born into slavery. Very exciting and emotional movie."
Harriet,73,97,audience,"Probably would give it less than three stars except Harriet Tubman’s story is amazing. This film starts strong but gradually increases the Hollywood formula shite so that by the end you just know half of the scenes are purely for some added drama (e.g. the final, sloppy, absurd confrontation of Harriet, Bigger Long and Gideon). There is absolutely no need to embellish Harriet Tubman’s story with some “personal” drama. Additionally, the seizures/visions from God are way too conveniently timed with every slave chase, it just comes across as silly. So, what’s to like? Pretty much everything else, most of which appears to be accurate reconstruction of Harriet Tubman’s bad-ass, incredibly courageous crusade to free slaves and advocate for disadvantaged people. "
Harriet,73,97,audience,Cynthia Eviro is a joy to watch. I need to watch this one again and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a harrowing drama.
Harriet,73,97,audience,"I didn't make it through the entire movie, but the part I saw was dull. The plot (spoiler) was: JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS"
Harriet,73,97,audience,"The production value is good enough, but the premise of Harriet's “visions from god” taken as the truth is just too over the top. Really too bad, they took an excellent historical story and ruined it."
Harriet,73,97,audience,If you don't care about historical accuracy then this film *might* be for you. Rotten.
Harriet,73,97,critic,"
A momentous figure like Harriet Tubman deserves to be honored in every way possible. Unfortunately, Harriet is just a so-so celebration of her life, delving too much into storytelling tricks instead of letting Tubman's story lead the way.
 "
Harriet,73,97,critic,"
While Harriet may not be a masterpiece, it's worth seeing for its fantastic lead performance and its important message.
 "
Harriet,73,97,critic,"
The movie that celebrates her life occasionally errs in its excess-it covers a great deal of ground-but the light it shines on Tubman and her accomplishments burns brightly.

There is something here that hooks you, that has you feeling better upon leaving [the theater] than when you sat down.
 "
Harriet,73,97,critic,"
The movie unproductively splits the difference between reverence and thrills. The thriller scenes aren't particularly suspenseful, and the dramatic stuff isn't particularly graceful.
 "
Harriet,73,97,critic,"
Cynthia Erivo delivers a stirring performance as iconic American abolitionist Harriet Tubman... But the movie falls apart in its final third, departing from history in an implausible bid to turn Tubman into a gun-toting superhero.
 "
Harriet,73,97,critic,"
Embodying Harriet Tubman is the talented Cynthia Erivo who gives a richly textured performance.
 "
Harriet,73,97,critic,"
'Harriet' is not a film about slavery. It's a powerful, inspirational and redemptive film about a woman who changed the course of American history.
 "
Harriet,73,97,critic,"
Director Kasi Lemmons makes an admirable attempt at bringing Tubman's story to the big screen and even makes it more cinematic than its ""glorified TV movie"" criticisms have suggested.
 "
Harriet,73,97,critic,"
Importing an actor to portray her, no matter how talented Erivo is, strikes the wrong note, so to speak.

Harriet is the kind of movie I would have liked to have seen in high school when learning about the Underground Railroad and the fight against slavery.
 "
Harriet,73,97,critic,"

This is Erivo's movie and she's an incendiary presence, capable of immense sensitivity as well as soaring defiance.

Yesterday,63,89,audience,"RATING: C+  Director: Danny Boyle 
Yesterday has a really good and intriguing premise but they should have gone further. Himesh Patel is really good and you will like his character because he's mostly well written. And Danny Boyle is actually a good Director ( his Direction in 126 Hours and Slumdog Millionaire were great ), you can see at points that he tried to bring his unique style to the film ( for instance when he shot 2-3 Scenes with the Dutch Angle ). But they really could've done much more with this great idea."
Yesterday,63,89,audience,"A touching tribute from director Danny Boyle to the Fab Four (plus an interesting premise). A world where no one had ever heard of The Beatles, except for Jack Malik (played by Himesh Patel), after being involved in an accident, wakes up to just such a world. Struggling with his own music career, he plagiarizes The Beatles songs to finally make a name for himself. However, over the course of the film, he must choose between the feelings his has for his long time friend and former manager Ellie (played by Lily James) and his successful music career. A very touching moment towards the end of the film that I won't spoil."
Yesterday,63,89,audience,"This was a silly movie and I really enjoyed it. I think it was fitting that a movie featuring the music of the greatest artist of the 20th century should feature a cameo from Michael Kiwanuka, the greatest artist of the 21st century!"
Yesterday,63,89,audience,Loved the music. Great versions of the originals.
Yesterday,63,89,audience,"This movie was marketed like a standard rom-com excuse to cover Beatles tunes, but the truth is its a really fun casual movie with a great story and humor that doesn't feel forced. Can't say this will be your favorite movie of all time, but it's 100% worth the watch. 

If you like the Beatles there are some very touching moments, but this movie is not just for Beatles fans."
Yesterday,63,89,audience,Rather enjoyed it - the plot was a little thin but I'm happy with the ending.
Yesterday,63,89,audience,Such a great premise but ultimately ruined by schmaltzy romance.

Yesterday,63,89,audience,"Yesterday is such a good movie and as a Beatles fan, it really made me smile. The only thing that kept me from rating it 5 stars was that it left the story in the world without The Beatles. And, why was there 2 people who remember The Beatles and everyone else didn't?"

Yesterday proves that you need much more than a high concept to make a successful movie. The music of The Beatles is legendary and will be celebrated for the foreseeable future, but this film is not the showcase that it could have been.

If the movie is going to bring up such ideas, does it have an obligation to explore them in any real way? I'm actually going to argue it doesn't.

There's a sunny, silly disposition to every frame that ensures it's difficult to ever be cynical about the film, despite its rather cheap aesthetic and raggedy visual style.
 "
Yesterday,63,89,critic,"
Yesterday is somewhat unfocused. Curtis is a pleasant, clever enough writer when he is not being sentimental, with a certain ability to create comic-touching moments, but the overall argument is unclear...

Yesterday still succeeds thanks to the zestful pacing of director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting) and effective performances by pretty much all the actors involved.

It's a cute concept that will allow audiences to hear these familiar tunes with fresh ears - particularly since Patel is a strong singer who delivers the songs confidently and without affect.

Director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) and screenwriter Richard Curtis (Love Actually) have divergent cinematic sensibilities, but they meld well enough in this bittersweet, slightly wacky musical fantasy rom-com.

Ironically, Yesterday focusses on a man who plagiarises one of the most iconic back catalogues in the history of modern music, while Curtis seems equally happy to continue doing the same to his own.

Child's Play,63,57,audience,Buena pelicula. Entretenida
Child's Play,63,57,audience,"A terrible remake. After it was over I asked myself, ""what did I just watch?"" I was never huge into the franchise and I understand how the story shows our growing over reliance on technology. Even though I'm typically not a fan of child actors, Gabriel Bateman really was the only person to do a decent job. Aubrey Plaza was her usual airhead self, with very little to contribute to the film. Mark Hamill even seemed to phone it in as the voice of Chucky. His performance felt like it was done in 1 afternoon session. And the mechanical doll itself (not the CGI) was awful and the look was just off."

Simply put, Child's Play is the best possible scenario for a reboot of this franchise, because you know there are going to be more.
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
The 2019 remake is clumsy, scare-free and devoid of what made the original a classic
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
The Child's Play remake is not just a wickedly demented blast, but it's everything a remake should be.
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
I had fun with the idea the film was pushing with mankind being the victim of its own evil ways but I wanted more.
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
Fans of the schlocky Chucky series will not find the same kind of absurd fun in this unneeded reboot.
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
This just wasn't a good movie to me. I liked the consciousness of the serial killer, but the AI just did not land.
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
Short, entertaining, stupid, absolutely insane. Could have been a lot worse, but it could've been way better.
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
I think they made a lot of good reasons for this [remake] to exist.
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
While not as subversive as Holland's cult classic, Klevberg's polished version is a delightfully vicious ode to its campy origins, proving that a remake can be worthwhile if made with enough creativity and a current social awareness.
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
Despite how impressive the new Chucky looks - rendered with a blend of practical on-set puppet work and digital enhancements - he is never scary.
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
Child's Play 2019 feels like little more than an uninspired, spiteful cash-grab meant to claw a big name Horror Icon away from the people who really care about it
 "
Child's Play,63,57,critic,"
Child's Play isn't going to win any Oscars, but it's a film that you're going to have a lot of fun with. There are laugh-out-loud moments, completely idiotic sections, plenty of creepiness and of course, our beloved Chucky.

Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,audience,"Yes, another sequel that nobody knew they wanted (other than the studio apparently). I thought the whole horror GROUNDHOG DAY wrapped it up just fine the first time; however, after this, hopefully, they can finally put the franchise to sleep. Towards the beginning of the film the story tries to explain how other characters are now in this time loop and I don't feel like they succeeded in explaining it. They over thunk it but once you get past that, the story actually does have some heart to it, which I was surprised but appreciated. At times main star Jessica Rothe does really pull at your heartstrings. The killer was more obvious this time around, although they did use a part from the original script of part 1 that was later changed. It appears they went ahead with it anyway in the sequel."
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,audience,"Good film over all. I liked the plot about all the sci-fi stuff but it could be better. I have only one question though, why did the day not repeat when Tree didn't get killed? But still a good movie."
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,audience,It's a really good movie
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,audience,Serves up some fun frights and laughs as the original 
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,audience,Tonally quite inconsistent.
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,audience,really fun franchise
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,audience,Well made what a suprise
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,audience,"Garbage senseless rubbish and a complete disappointment as the firs was quite good.  Where to begin?  Carter 2 comes back to kill Carter 1, never explained.  It's a disjointed series of montages whereas the first had a cohesive story.

Garbage and disappointing to see critics score it high presumably because of a female lead.  The first was good, this is awful."
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,audience,Happy Death 2U is a big F you to the haters of the first
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,audience,"Watched this, not knowing it was a sequel. It's a standalone, so it didn't matter that I'd not seen the first. The premise is kind of interesting, with the hammy acting and the over-americanised characters providing the majority of any comedy (that is not to say the movie is funny). It's more a sci-fi drama than anything else... it wasn't scary or tense"
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
Less a slasher parody and more a time travel comedy, Happy Death Day 2U is a bold departure for the franchise that nails its emotional beats even better than its predecessor.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
I wouldn't say it's on par with the first one but it definitely takes the idea and runs with it.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
Happy Death Day 2U, more importantly, never loses sight of its secret weapon: Rothe, who rolls with every punch this film throws at her.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
Occasionally frightful, frequently funny, and fearlessly enjoyable even when it's overly bogged down with exposition.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
Landon is focused on delivering a wild ride that holds together surprisingly well, despite the increased narrative complication.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
[T]he film is oddly preoccupied with sticking to its logic. It wants to take its premise so off-the-wall that every chuckle lives and dies on whatever contrivance precedes it.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
The new film entertains while also feeling a bit familiar. But in the dog days of February, you could do a lot worse at the theater.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
The good news is that Happy Death Day 2U is actually quite a bit funnier and more ridiculous than the first film, and while it seems to have sacrificed scares for laughs, the tradeoff feels worth it as the fun factor is increased to fill the void.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
This is one of those gather your friends, order some pizza, and enjoy a laugh for two hours type of flicks.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
Jessica Rothe is a star... she oozes charisma, has great comic timing, and her emotional scenes are fantastic. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
Happy Death Day 2U has found a way to keep the premise fresh and just as entertaining as the original.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
Happy Death Day 2U never stops being a wild ride.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
The change in genre is the best twist Landon could take for the franchise, playing to the series' strengths as a lightweight, stylish genre comedy.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
Happy Death Day 2U is easily the most fun movie experience I've had in the early part of the 2019 movie year. It has a little bit of something for everyone and is a good Valentine's Day date movie.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
Seeing all of the characters return and some of the first film's sequences revisited in a slightly different setting is a plus for anyone who enjoyed the original film.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
It's an unwieldy, uncertain monster of a movie, so lacking the first's amiable nimbleness and cheek. Bigger means hollower in this inessential sequel, yet it's still entirely watchable at the worst of times due to Rothe's effervescent presence.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
This film is basically just ridiculous nonsense. I had a ton of fun.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
Happy Death 2U answers all of the first film's unanswered questions and has way more fun with its wacky time loop murder concept in an extremely entertaining way.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
It's both a fantastic and audacious sequel that is willing to kill its darlings and be different, while simultaneously...well, unfortunately killing its darlings and being completely different.
 "
Happy Death Day 2U,71,58,critic,"
This movie is a mess when it comes to tying the pieces together, but it's also an absolute blast.

What Men Want,42,33,audience,"Poorly written movie ! If it wasn't funny at some moments I would've given it one star or less. It's sad to see that the movie industry has now more focus in casting actors from various ""races"" and forcing the presence of homosexuals in every movie but they don't even put any efforts to write a good script for a movie ! I mean this film could be at best consiered a parody of the good old movie ""What women want"" and can't claim to be decent rom-com movie. For god sake, how could they mess up with such an interesting topic as male/female psychology and sexual dynamics ?"
What Men Want,42,33,audience,"Are you kidding me?! audience score is only 33%? That's harsh.
This film was a good laugh. Worth a watch!"
What Men Want,42,33,audience,"I liked it! Easy watching, light-hearted fun."
What Men Want,42,33,audience,"The main actress has some charisma. Some of the men's thoughts are funny. I laughed a grand total of 2 times. It's just not that good. It's an interesting premise. But it's just messy and there is no substance in the story or the dialogue. And let me guess for sponsored this film... Fiji water? With the distracting references to Fiji water constantly. Other then that, there isn't much substance here. 

All in all, I can't recommend it. You could use your time in so many better ways."
What Men Want,42,33,audience,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

While it's potentially problematic for many of the same reasons for the Mel Gibson ""What Women Want"", I think this is a much better version, and a good modernization.  It's also a good way to shift it to a ""black movie"".

Taraji P. Henson does an excellent job carrying the movie and it is full of good humor, and exciting moments.

The movie does send a little bit of a mixed message as it seems to indicate that a woman needs to be a man in order to play in a man's world, but it feels more like its about it not being a man's world.

This is a good time, my only concern is that she's not a very likable character at the start of the movie."
What Men Want,42,33,audience,"Nothing special, at times felt to be perpetuating gender stereotypes and problematic ideas without any real subversion or clear resolution at the end. Meh."
What Men Want,42,33,audience,Woeful remake that didn't need to be made.
What Men Want,42,33,audience,"The Movie works because of Taraji Henson, she has incredible range and charisma, I saw her on Hidden Figures and Empire before. There are some funny moments, but not a lot. 

This is basically a remake of Mel Gibson's 2000 Movie What Women Want, but from a different perspective. Not necessarily great, but good enough to pass the time."
What Men Want,42,33,audience,What men want has a few laughs and some good performances but not much else. The film feels long bloated and at almost 2 hours long it certainly does. The plot and ending are very predictable and the movie does have a few chuckles but nothing all that memorable or laugh out loud. In the end it’s just another romantic comedy with the ability to hear men as a side chuckle. Sadly that chuckle is only used in half of the film.
What Men Want,42,33,audience,"What Men Want is a remake of Mel Gibson's movie What Women Want with Taraji P Henson as the female version.  The story surrounds Taraji acts as a sports agent who is passed on from getting a promotion and she ends up drinking some odd drink from a fortune teller that gets her to read men's minds.  Hanson becomes self centered and ends up hurting those around her instead of helping them all she wants to do is sign the next NBA superstar rookie.  The plot was thin and predictable to the point it was dumbfounded.  The supporting cast included Aldiss Hodge, Tracy Morgan and cameos from Shaq, Grant Hill, and Mark Cuban. Skip this movie it isn't worth your time."
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
Proof that Taraji P. Henson can carry a film like it's literally nobody's business.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
Henson, easily one of the more under-appreciated actresses working today, is absolutely terrific here.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
Bloated and misshapen, cramming in so much extra stuff that it's never able to make the most of what it has got.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
While this sounds pretty straightforward in theory, the script is too hyperactive to settle on one path without getting distracted by its overabundance of subplots.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
If even one part of the film had worked -- if it had been funnier or a more scathing social commentary -- I might have given it a pass despite other flaws. But everything about it systematically lets us down and fails to meet even baseline expectations.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
Except for ticking the right diversity boxes and a few funny moments, this isn't even what women want let alone what men want.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
While Taraji's performance never wavers... her ability to 'save' a movie is limited when the story is less developed than the character.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
All in all, this bland, overlong film swings and misses way more often than it connects.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
If you really want to see a romantic comedy go check this out, but if you really want to see Taraji and enjoy yourself go in with low expectations.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
A dim, grim and irritating farce, on a two-hour search-and-destroy mission for your sense of humour.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
Taraji P.Henson is entertaining but is better than this material. The breakout star though is Erykah Badu.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
One of these days, someone's going to write a leading role worthy of Taraji P. Henson.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
Felt like it might have had some sharpness and some bite, but ended up being defanged.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
[What Men Want] feels entirely more rote and uninspired, featuring few elements of genuine creative ambition.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
For a film that touts female empowerment and regularly throws around mentions to the ""Me Too"" movement, What Men Want is a shallow, retrograde workplace comedy that is barely funny.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
What Men Want is a comedy that is bursting with untapped potential.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
It's just not as funny, progressive or challenging as the concept - a gender swapped remake of the Mel Gibson starrer What Women Want - would have allowed it to be.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
Works with its tried plot device, resulting in the type of superficially pleasing comedy that audiences will lap up along with their snacks before it fades away with a more substantial meal.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
Running at two hours, it overstays its welcome in favor of unnecessary subplots.
 "
What Men Want,42,33,critic,"
What Women Want is a gal pal popcorn comedy with more laughs than you might expect from its silly Hollywood fantasy premise, largely thanks to Taraji P. Hensen and a hard-working supporting cast.

Halloween,79,70,audience,A great modern slasher that had everything you would expect. The horror elements were good and Michael was as scary as ever. Not as good as the original but it is really hard to ever top the original. Very enjoyable and sets up the next movie very well.
Halloween,79,70,audience,"It's a decent Halloween sequel but it's definitely not the best sequel like a lot of people make it out to be. Michael Myers is definitely the best part of this film. James Jude Courtney's take on Michael Myers is like Nick Castle and Tyler Mane put together which is a great mix and the 2018 mask is my favorite of the franchise. This movie does also have some great kills and great shots of the offscreen kills. Other than Michael Myers and great acting by Laurie strode and a little bit of the characters, this movie suffers a lot of issues. For example, their are characters in this movie that are just their just to adjust the plot like for example they boyfriend. He is dating Allyson and he seems like he's gonna be a main part of the film but he only existed to get Allyson out of the party without a phone and to me that's lazy writing. Plus this movie does feel like they're trying a little too hard with callbacks to previous movies in the franchise. Also the character of Sartain definitely wasn't handle well I mean I always got a weird vibe from him but the way they killed off the sheriff to me it's feels like the sheriff was wasted in this movie and he was great. It's still a decent movie but it's not ""THE BEST SEQUEL"" in my opinion."
Halloween,79,70,audience,"This movie is good, but suffers from distracting teen character and a bazar mid act twist that doesn't pay off in any way"
Halloween,79,70,audience,"Halloween (2018) consegue ter um feito igual ao do filme original, sua fotografia inspirada no primeiro filme e usar de todas as formas não mostrar a face do vilão o deixa com um ar sobrenatural. Além de voltar com personagens dos filmes antigos casando muito bem com a trama, a atuação de Jamie Lee Curtis e a estreante Andi Matichak se saem tão bem que mostram realmente o medo de horas que o assassino Michael Myers ataca. Além de uma boa representividade de Jamie lee Curtis que mesmo tendo 60 anos na cara consegue liderar um filme slasher muito bem, o roteiro fez bem em não colocar Andi Matichak, a neta de Laurie Strode como a principal, mas a deixando um pouco em segundo plano e fazendo que Laurie fique com mais medo de morrer ou perder a neta. Halloween de 2018 consegue ser assustador, incrível e ter o mesmo feito que o de 1978."
Halloween,79,70,audience,"Like always, the victims fall over their feet, go check out that strange noise upstairs and leave their secure shelter to check out that car parked in front of the house. Michael Myers, despite being presumably in his late sixties not only survives being shot multiple times and being run over by a car at full speed, after all this he is also still stronger than the Rock. If you like the typical slasher movie it might do the trick for you, but the only thing it did for me is to make me very angry. Even the final kill is not satisfying at all, Laurie's daughter had the chance to shoot him in the head when he fell down the stairs, but instead she chose to hurry over him, up the stairs, leaving him IN A ROOM FULL OF WEAPONS, GIVING HIM THE CHANCE TO GRAB HER ANKLES. wow. Really? Everyone keeps saying this is a movie about strong women, but it really is that full of women taking stupid decisions, that I would classify it as a remake of scary movie. I know in this moment joss whedon is in hot water, but he really is the only person to have created a female character in the horror genre that is strong and fierce.
EDIT: so, 24 h passed since I watched the movie and I am still livid about the stupid script. I guess I have to make a list of all the things I didn't like to get it off my mind *SPOILERS AHEAD*
1) the journalists. They're dick heads. I don't like them. So you think visiting Laurie at home and trying to pressure her into talking to Michael is ok? Instant Karma ensues, only satisfying moment of the movie when the dickhead journalist dies. 
2) the sock slide of the babysitter. So, in every other Hollywood produced movie Noone ever takes off their shoes. Americans seem to jump out of bed with their shoes on and only take them off just before going to bed. Yet there she is, the pretty blonde, sliding with her socks on the hardwood floor and so signing her death sentence. 
3)the shrink. So the psychiatrist is crazy and wants to kill too. Wow, what a plot twist.... 
4) Laurie's son in law going outside to check on that police car. So you know there's a crazy killer around looking to get inside the house. And you choose to go outside, leaving the door open? Darwin Award nominee.
5)also Laurie, why did you bring your family back to your house in the first place. You know he wants you. Why not go back alone and let them drive out of town? 
6)you have that fancy basement panic room hidden under the kitchen island, but you leave the remote on the counter, go down AND CLOSE THE DOOR WITH THE SWITCH DOWNSTAIRS LEAVING THE REMOTE UPSTAIRS. Y tho? 
7)so you hide in your fancy panic room, you have to do nothing but stay quiet, he will never know you're there, but you think it's a good idea to fire your gun through the kitchen floor, hoping to shoot through the Michael's foot. You obviously miss and Michael unnecessarily learns about your position. Great job. 
8)you come out to search for Michael in the house, giving away your advantage. The panic room has one entrance, if he wants you he has to come through that door, don't you think that it would be safer to wait there and point the gun at the entrance? 
9)so Laurie's daughter manages to shoot Michels ear off, and he somehow falls into the panic room. He is laying on his back, vulnerable, and you drop your weapon and climb over him, instead of shooting him in the head and ending it there. Yyyyyy thoooo??? I don't understand, please help 😕"

Halloween,79,70,critic,"
Halloween is [Laurie Strode's] love letter to all of us, wrapped in a most excellent slasher movie.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
Both a reboot and a bloody love letter to the director who started it all, John Carpenter.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
Halloween (1978) is an incredible film with a lot of subpar sequels. HALLOWEEN (2018) is no exception.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
Erasing all the films that followed the original, this one gives us a truly connected and worthy continuation of the story, full of nostalgia.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
This endeavor would have been far more compelling had there not been so many prior theatrical chapters and remakes.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
The best sequel in the film's 11 movie franchise.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
After four decades, ""Halloween"" finally gets the sequel it deserves, providing a scary good time for slasher horror fans by faithfully following the formula. This 11th installment asks us to forget the silly sequels and pretend like they never happened.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
[T]he film can't balance its wryer tone with its sillier obligations, and it's polluted with idiotic stock characters who act upon the most suicidal accords imaginable.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
Halloween 2018 gives us the family reunion that we've been waiting for.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
After 2 troubled outings via Rob Zombie , the original Michael Myers is back and in great form. David Gordon Green almost nails it despite a few weak character decisions. But the Myers mystique is back along with a hell bent Jamie Lee Curtis.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
It has a great admiration for John Carpenter's classic original, while doing just enough to stand on its own legs.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
Nick Castle is in total control of the character and every time he appears on the screen, he conveys an aura of terror. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
I somehow sat through the entirety of director David Gordon Green's Halloween and was never scared. How is that possible?
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
A dark and exciting thrill ride ... There is absolutely no predicting where the story's going, or when most of the scares will come.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
A murder-happy slasher crowd-pleaser. Tense, gory, and full of nervous laughter, you can do much worse than spending 106 minutes with grim, loaded-for-bear Laurie Strode.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
Halloween is a feminist slasher flick for a new generation. As the men bumble their way through the narrative, each easily dispatched by Myers, it's three generations of Strode women who are tasked with taking out the Boogeyman.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
All in all, Halloween delivers everything one could reasonably expect from it and then some.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
For the casual viewer or someone that just wants to have a little scary movie time for the season, it's fine but for the big Halloween/horror fans, it may not be enough.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
Halloween is merely a short-cut for the same boring ""strong-female lead"" characterizations we've been seeing for the better part of twenty years now.
 "
Halloween,79,70,critic,"
Easily the best of the Halloween sequels...

The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,audience,"The Kid Who Would Be King is another tale of Arthur and the knights of the round table only this one is based on kids who embark on a quest to destroy Morgana. With the help of the mighty wizard Merlin played by Patrick Stewart. The script evolves around Arthur's great great grandson who learns his destiny and how he should help his realm of society.  Although the story was predictable, it was really fun family movie to watch. It was an awesome flick for kids with great CGI effects and wonderfully directed. Definitely recommend this movie."
The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,audience,"I remember seeing The Kid Who Would Be King in theaters a while ago, and it was fucking marvelous. I don't see why the audience panned the hell out of this movie. This is a movie i would definitely recommend anyone to see."
The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,audience,"Not the best movie ever, but it is a good film to just sit down, turn off your brain, and enjoy. Great family movie."
The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,audience,"Good overall movie to enjoy with the family about Knights of the round table, but, it was predictable and the battles too easily won."
The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,audience,"For once, the critics score is more right than the audience score. A superficially ""kids"" or ""family friendly"" movie with unexpected depths and surprising insights. It understands, to quote Vaclav Havel (and the same point made byAleksandr Solzhenitsyn), ""The line {between good and evil] did not run clearly between ‘them' and ‘us/ but through each person."" The code of chivalry commits the children to truth and justice and perseverance: in a word, to suffering for others, even dying for them if needs be. Well-written, well-acted, and with well-staged CGI action scenes that satisfy George Lucas' original admonition for action: that it should advance the story. Although lighter in tone than the Harry Potter movies (and the novels on which they're based), it shares J.K. Rowling's central insight: that children are philosophers of life and death from an early age, a knowledge that both ages them and keeps them every young, protecting them from cynicism, despair, indifference in their quest for the Good. Immensely satisfying from beginning to end."
The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,audience,This movie is a tremendous amount of fun. A lot of positive messages and plenty of action. Are you ready to get your faith renewed? Check it out.
The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,audience,kid movie............
The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,audience,"I really enjoyed this movie all the way through! The young actors were on spot with the characters they were portraying and it was nice to see Patrick Stewart as Merlin in this quirky interpretation of the King Arthur legend.  The special effects were fun and Louis Ashbourne Serkis in the lead was engaging and spirited. Tom Taylor is a young actor to be reckoned with! Angus Imrie as Young Merlin was real scene stealer!  Watch it...it has just enough ""fright"" factor for the adults and fantasy for all!!!"
The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,audience,Okay when me and my friends went to see this we didn't understand a thing after some time I kinda thought it was a waste of time and money

The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,critic,"
There are flashes of that Cornish flair and moments of impressive comedy, but every grasp for pathos finds only empty space.
 "
The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,critic,"
Packed with history, politics, family drama, and the kind of depth you may not expect from a film with kids in the leads. With all of that being true, both kids and adults will appreciate and admire the movie; it's an unapologetic blast.

Joe Cornish's timely retelling of Arthurian legend is an adventure for the whole family.

Did the world really need another blowhard Arthur and a Round Table of gritty, humorless fanatics? The Kid Who Would Be King's good-natured positivity seems much more appropriate to the moment.
 "
The Kid Who Would Be King,89,55,critic,"
A perfectly pleasant, if a touch innocuous, rejigging of the Arthurian legend for a modern audience.

It's got a great kid-energy to it, but also [has] real adventures, real danger, and real stakes.

[Joe] Cornish's attempt at merging a classic legend with our modern day issues is successful.

A Moment in the Reeds,100,83,audience,This Finnish film is a three-character study.   Levee returns from his college studies in Paris to help his father renovate their lakeside house in Finland. Tareq from Syria is hired to assist. A quiet tender loving relationship between Levee and Tareq consumes the brunt of this exceptional movie. The slow burn will leave you emotionally wiped out.
A Moment in the Reeds,100,83,audience,"Simple yet beautifully made. It conveys passion and affection then getting beaten by various trials and tribulations constantly until regret. Such a wonderful story. Acting is great, it nicely shows different emotions from lust and delight to anger and sorrow. Altogether with the breathtaking cinematography of the Finnish lake and chilling ""moments in the reed"". I can safely say that this movie is a hidden gem."
A Moment in the Reeds,100,83,audience,This movie is extremely overrated. The acting left something to be desired. Tbh I think they really missed the mark on this with such a promising storyline. Quite disappointing.
A Moment in the Reeds,100,83,audience,"Ok. Slow start and continued very slowly. Story line was good, but needed something more."
A Moment in the Reeds,100,83,audience,Amazing Sex Scenes. I had to rewatch the first sex scene so that I can picture myself doing it as well.

Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,audience,"Buena historia, aunque un poco larga e inconclusa."
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,audience,The WOKE version of history....
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,audience,"Stunningly beautiful in scenery and sets, but another blatant attempt to rewrite history into a woke, inclusive construct. Mary as an incredible beauty who never ages a day over 25 years and who picked up a Scottish accent from God knows where, African Americans throughout the Royal Courts of England and Scotland, everyone dressed in black (presumably for the movie's funeral once the public views it), one- dimensional supporting characters all lead to a boring portrayal of an exciting period of history. Snore."
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,audience,"I had high hopes for this film but it turned out to be very disappointing. The pace is plodding and uneven and the plot feels rather banal without defining themes. I'm not a stickler for historical accuracy but this film gets a lot of big things wrong. The main characters never met in real life, despite it featuring as a pivotal scene. A number of characters like John Knox are relegated to small one dimensional roles and the 'woke' casting is incongruous. Saorise Ronan is probably the stand out performance but Margot Robbie's Elizabeth is far too meek and passive. It's a very middle-of-the-road biopic and anyone who enjoys the history will know its been done better in other films and TV shows."
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,audience,"The characters and scenery, and locations were really good. Sadly the film as usual for goes most of history.
Mary queen of Scots, and Elisabeth of England never met, and Mary never spoke Scots, she was brought up in France from a small child.
She also spent most of her adult life living in England, where she moved from castle to castle. During which time the Abington plot to have Elisebeth murdered brought her downfall. The film states at the end this fact was not proven, yet it was, as Mary's letter to Babington were intercepted. Yet as in most films portraying historical facts, the main points are either changed or left out."
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,audience,"This biopic does not nesscarily respect Christian Faith and turns it into something bad which is a big no no. Also apparently it has inaccuracies as well. I had to skip it at different times but saw enough of it. However it does tell quite a story that can keep you on toes of history at times, and I love the costume design and makeup and hairstyling. It has a beautiful score/theme score as well. It is beautifully shot too."
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,audience,"Completely inappropriate casting of characters it was like visiting United Nations with ethnic groups pretending to be characters from Scotland and England, pathetic."
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,audience,Repressed to the point of boring. Was barely able to finish the film on Netflix.
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,audience,Interesting to watch. I almost like it.
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,audience,"What I cant understand is why take a historical movie and add a Black Lord with power? Were there even Black people back then in 
England? Since its concederd to be based on historical facts maybe actually follow how it was actually back then, it feels like the whole movie is wrong. Besides that movie was average."
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,critic,"
Rourke's movie, while not the worst, is generally flat and mediocre. It reduces a deeply dramatic story to the small change of the director's attitude toward gender and personal relationships.

As many people have pointed out, this film is certainly not historically accurate so if you're the kind of person who needs that you'd leave feeling disappointed.

It is a handsome, yet frivolous, period drama told through a sharp modern gaze that greatly benefits from a number of strong performances from across its very talented cast.

It's melodramatic and unashamedly fictionalised, but it's also a joy to watch.

 "
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,critic,"
it's telling that one of the most compelling characters in the film is Mary's gay husband, Henry, played in a refreshingly honest manner by Jack Lowden...he is often more interesting than the two queens.
 "
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,critic,"
It's a shame that everything collapses when the queens finally meet in a sequence that has all the heft of a gauzy Chanel fragrance spot.
 "
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,critic,"
...grabs for relevance come across as a desperate plea. The blatantness of it undermines the more subtle tones of a visually sweeping film, with strong performances. There are many jewels in this crown, the crown itself just needs a bit of extra polish.

Mary Queen of Scots is about an OG Queen making all the folks in the United Kingdom put respect on her name.

Mary, Mary, quite contrary, what does your movie show? Historical inaccuracies, an overstuffed story and a director not in the know.

A traditional and essentially conservative biopic that your mum might like if The Favourite is too weird.
 "
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,critic,"
Unfortunately, too much time is spent on luridness which gives this historical drama a feeling more akin to the naughty Showtime series The Tudors.
 "
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,critic,"
I wish I could summon an ounce of enthusiasm for this film: it seems like a lot of effort was put into realising this 400-something year old tale. It is just too bad that it feels every bit its age.
 "
Mary Queen of Scots,62,41,critic,"
The costumes are utterly sumptuous and the period details are convincing, but to really see and understand the emotions governing those who govern others is what makes this film so remarkable.

Once Upon a Deadpool,55,55,audience,"Before I get into this review, I'm debating whether I should review this movie as a film on its own or a deadpool cut like the super duper cut. I'll do the same with the super cut. This added some new stuff to the movie but took away most of the good stuff from deadpool 2. I don't think fox or Ryan Reynolds sold out but I'm surprised by how much this movie is like the sequel. It feels the same. If you gave me this and the other movie I wouldn't prefer one over the other. Waste of money though, just wait till it's on Disney plus."
Once Upon a Deadpool,55,55,audience,"54% """"Once Upon a Deadpool"" helps lacks fairy tale atmosphere with handling the ""Deadpool 2"" sort of vibe, but it's fresh and zany enough from the studio that brought you ""Anastasia"" and ""Avatar""""."

This Deadpool movie has more heart and heartbreak, a surer handle on its storytelling, and a clearer sense of how breaking the fourth wall can be used to comic effect.

That over the top, gory as hell, crazy to watch violence is what really sets Deadpool 2 and Once Upon a Deadpool apart. The humor that comes from the violence is so insane that it becomes comedic.

Deadpool 2 works surprisingly well as a PG-13 film, although Deadpool is best when he is left to be his sarcastic, vulgar self.

Once Upon A Deadpool is rated PG-13, but it shouldn't be.
 "

That more isn't done with the ""remixing"" premise means that [it's] a lesser curiosity (albeit adjacent to a good cause) rather than the true companion piece to Deadpool 2 it could have been.

This neutered version of DEADPOOL 2 has no reason to exist on its own terms, as literally everything content wise you most likely have at home already, but the charm is still there.

Frankly, if Once Upon A Deadpool had just gone all in ... instead of just fast cuts and terrible ADR, OUAD could've been something truly special.

A Star Is Born,90,79,audience,"I fail to see how this movie delivers on all of the hype, it's predictable and mundane, poor acting from lady gaga is cringe all the way through"
A Star Is Born,90,79,audience,Meh. Don't know what the big fuss was about.
A Star Is Born,90,79,audience,"An absolutely incredible movie that looks at important issues like substance abuse, suicide, and what fame can do to a person. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper truly deliver strong emotions in their performances throughout. The soundtrack for the film is so heartwarming and listening to the songs takes you back and reminds you of the story of Jackson and Ally. Both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's vocals are incredible, and the lyrics of the songs Gaga and Cooper wrote (with other songwriters) for the film are so beautifully written to put into words the relationship between Jackson and Ally, and their journeys both together and separately.

Cooper did an incredible job directing, co-producing, starring, singing, and playing the guitar and piano. His portrayal was so captivating and believable!

Gaga's acting was amazing, especially considering this is her first time in a starring role. It was so lovely seeing Gaga without make-up (not that she isn't lovely with it) and I really loved her portrayal of Ally and the emotions she put into Ally and the way Ally sings in that last scene (the emotions - just wow) it was so breathtakingly beautiful!

My favorite thing about the film is the whole movie is about, well, a star (Ally portrayed by Lady Gaga) being ""born"" through Jackson (portrayed by Bradley Cooper) and how her rise to fame is because Jackson believed in her and saw her talent and he made sure that she showed her talent to the world. I loved that Jackson got Ally to sing her song and never gave up on her, also that Ally was there for Jackson at his worst moments (well besides the suicide) and that she tried to get him to stop drinking and taking drugs (which he did for a small period of time). They had up's and down been but stayed at each other's side always. It's a beautiful but heartbreaking story that truly centers around the fact that Jackson helped a star (Ally) be born (haha see what I did there). Everything they went through together and apart from all leading up to that final scene where Ally looks straight into the camera because that's when she knows she's made it in the industry, that she is a star.

All in all the film is one of my all-time favorites!

Truly captivating and heartwarming, with very believable emotions."
A Star Is Born,90,79,audience,"Gaga and cooper have great chemistry, but the script and story are boring. Not much happens, and without the emotional downfall of characters that takes place the film falls flat. Very average movie."
A Star Is Born,90,79,audience,A star is born is an Incredible movie. Lady Gaga's performance is Outstanding considering it is her first big screen acting.
A Star Is Born,90,79,audience,"Felt like the dialogue and plot was kind of stilted at times, like real people don't act like that, other times it was fine. There's a lot of good story beats there: all of Jackson's backstory w his dad and brother, his drug problem, the look into the music industry and how artists have to navigate this weird space and how head fucky it is, her changing because of it and him feeling like he's losing the girl he met and loved, how neither of them are emotionally mature enough to talk to each other. Maybe that's part of it, that they try to do too much and so nothing gets the focus it needs. Felt bad for the characters of course, and Cooper and Gaga both sell it, not to mention perform well. Love me some Sam Elliot. Was pleasantly surprised to see Cooper directed, good for him. But it just didn't quite hook me"
A Star Is Born,90,79,audience,Most of the other reviews are obviously fake. So I have to give 0.5 to balance. The website should check on it to gain back it's credibility.
A Star Is Born,90,79,audience,"Not usually a fan of musicals romances but I thought this was excellent. What suprised me most was how compelling and original it felt - especially as it's a movie that has essentially been made 4 times. The story of creative talent and fame spiralling into addiction is a compelling one and the movie tells it in an emotional but not mawkish way. It's a strong directorial debut from Bradley Cooper helped by amazing Chemistry between him and Lady Gaga, a strong musical score and good supporting performances from the likes of Sam Elliot. Definitely recommend watching."
A Star Is Born,90,79,audience,Beautiful yet tragic.
A Star Is Born,90,79,audience,This movie was so bad I signed up just to leave a negative rating.

Could have been product, a glitzy film with a heartthrob and a pop star in the leads but instead resonates with real feelings and heartfelt emotion.
 "
A Star Is Born,90,79,critic,"
This A Star Is Born, unlike the more successful of its predecessors, never becomes a commentary on the destructive nature of stardom and success and the cruel, unforgiving character of the film or entertainment business.
 "
A Star Is Born,90,79,critic,"
As a director, Cooper's bag of tricks isn't exactly filled to bursting, but he cuts his scenes more concisely than any previous version and introduces his characters with naturalistic bits of dialogue.

Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,audience,"If you are reading this then- I define this movie as the best I have ever seen, you may have seen others which you associate to be all time greats such as citizen Kane and so forth however with the subtle links to real life events and the complete realism it demonstrates the complexity which is placed, each character is presented as an egg. Bland and boring on the outside but on the inside an array of genetic DNA with strands copious of producing many beings. The plot portrays its Deep and mysterious ways by diverging each story and blending them to create a masterpiece, for a wind of tape to be nothing to a watcher what is contained is a supernova ready to be unleashed."
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,audience,"As far as Tarantino knock-offs are go, Bad Times reigns supreme!"
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,audience,"It is very flawed, and wastes a lot of time with superfluous storylines and characters that make little sense. Despite that, it within it there is a satisfying action film. The acting and platonic chemistry between Cynthia Erivo and Jeff Bridges is worth watching in and of itself. Prepare to be bored or frustrated a few times, but I'd watch it anyway!"
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,audience,"This movie has no idea what it wants to be, and it shows miserably. The sloppy story telling waffles too much to sustain any interest or rhythm. What you're left with is just a boring collision of clutter."
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,audience,I loved going for the ride. Some twists that were fun and I didn't expect.  A fun 2 hours
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,audience,"A very disappointing movie... It's such a shame because it features a really good performance by Jeff Bridges, as well as stylish cinematography. This movie tries to reinvent retro, Tarantino-like, 1970s aesthetic. But it fails on several levels. The main problem with Bad Times at the El Royale is that it fails to appeal to modern audiences, which is part of why it was a box office failure. There's too much slow-pacing and irrelevant dialogue and backstory. Tarantino films are also lengthy, and have long scenes of dialogue, but he does it in such an entertaining manner than it fits perfectly with the flick. But here, it just feels like a drag, and sometimes it really feels like the film is going nowhere. And another problem is that there seems to be different plots interlocking all at once, but it's done in a sloppy manner. While it does have an entertaining enough finally, in the end it just feels like half of the film was for nothing. Overall, I've seen many superior slow-burn, neo-noir thrillers. Audiences who are into this type of movie may want to take a look for themselves if they want, but I wouldn't see this pic again..."
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,audience,"A hot, smelly mess. Obviously, given it's star-studded cast, it read better than it plays on screen. Not surprising given writer / director Drew Goddard's extensive experience as a writer (not director). Perhaps you should stick to writing Drew. And then maybe a good director could have edited out some of the pretentious social commentary and tried to make something of this meandering beast (although it would take more than a good director to fix this disaster). Any comparisons to Tarantino, whilst valid, are an insult to Quentin. Half a star, only because zero stars is not an option."
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,audience,Bad Times at the El Royale is the best thriller film I ever see!

Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
A good movie filled with bad people. It asks you to care about people who do terrible things and by the end, thanks to inventive storytelling and good performances - Erivo is s standout - you just might.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
The cast is terrific across the board, hopefully making a star out of Cynthia Erivo and telling the world that Jeff Bridges has a lot of enthusiasm left in him yet.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
[It] finally takes itself far too seriously for something so short on depth-let alone the wit and suspense it more urgently needs.
 "

Even if El Royale isn't a game changer for whodunit thrillers, it still manages to be pleasing for fans of such films.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
There's no denying El Royale's secret weapon. No, not all the smuggled guns everyone's packing, but the stunning vocals and magnetic delivery of Tony Award-wining British singer-songwriter, Cynthia Erivo.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
Bad Times at the El Royale holds a Western mirror to the musings seen in Japanese films of its own time period, making for a stylish -- if surface-level -- shapeshifter.

Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
It's a square film that relates many things at the same time, but does not know how to unite the set or make its characters interesting. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
Far too long, far too slow, and not nearly as engaging or clever as it wants to be.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
Bad Times at the El Royale is a noir so dark it's almost opaque. Drew Goddard expertly constructs a twisty narrative, giving us occasional glimpses into everyone's pasts, while puppet-mastering them toward the inevitable.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
Perhaps the most insufferable Tarantino knockoff since the 90s.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
[Drew] Goddard sure knows how to build tension in a scene, even if there are too many of them.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
What started out as a crackling yarn starts to become a numbing exercise in narrative excess.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
This is one uniquely fun romp with surprise after surprise.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
Bad Times unquestionably lives up to its pulpy title and delivers a twisting mystery with a cast of characters whose intentions are always in question.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
If you are a fan of Tarantino-esque type films then this is one you...it is an entertaining movie that requires viewing more than once to catch all the little nuances and details.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
A winning formula that overcomes most of its faults to provide a compelling and thoroughly entertaining yarn.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
Bad Times at the El Royale is a twisty, bloody, breath of fresh air to the action-thriller genre.
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
Much like writer/director Drew Goddard's previous effort The Cabin in the Woods, it's the mash-up of genres and own self-awareness that keeps the film from crumbling underneath it's own ambitious weight
 "
Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
An addictive backline of characters deliver a promising story that just explodes in a weird roller coaster of genres. [Full review in Spanish].

Bad Times at the El Royale,75,73,critic,"
At some point during this logy 2-hour-and-21-minute exercise you want something more substantial than even Hemsworth's admittedly mesmerizing snaky hips.

Assassination Nation,74,55,audience,"This manages to blend elements of the fantastical, with core-belief-shattering vulgarity and depravity, with a thread of real-life running through it (scarily). It had the look and feel of the Purge series of movies as well as Scott Pilgrim (minus the comedic entertainment), in parts. Its social commentary is pretty accurate, which is why it's so good. The more you watch, the more you're horrified and entranced in equal measure. I think the elements have been merged well, but I do feel the 'vengeance chapter' could have been binned, with a better ending used that would have held up what came before it with more conviction, and without disappointing the heart-poundingly tense audience (in this case, me!)"
Assassination Nation,74,55,audience,"Gets its point across flawlessly.  Loads of gore & triggers, with obligatory 30 year old playing teens, but I would reccomend for those nights when you want to burn the patriarchy to the ground but you're stuck home in quarantine."
Assassination Nation,74,55,audience,Boring waste of time
Assassination Nation,74,55,audience,"This movie was somewhat mindblowing, the story, the cast/characters and the aesthetics of the scenes."
Assassination Nation,74,55,audience,pretty entertaining satirical film but a little cringe worthy
Assassination Nation,74,55,audience,"I've heard it said that if 80% of us were to receive an anonymous message that simply said ""They know everything. Run."", we'd obey the imperative of the final word in the message. Even if we had no idea who 'they' are or which 'everything' was being referred to, we'd assume the very worst possible and attempt to outrun the impending storm. 

I don't know if that has any basis in real research, but this film takes that premise and runs with it in the age of the smartphone and 4chan - and just to twist the knife a little more, sets it all in Salem, Massachusettes. Someone is hacking the secrets of first one, then a couple more, then a few more, then a good number of the population of the town and posting them for all to see. A group of girls become the target of vigilante justice, believed to be responsible for the hacks, and it spins ever further out of control. Directed with an immense visual flare that never distracts from plot or character, and a sharp script that manages to stay just the right side of too on the nose, it's a highly effective, thought-provoking and gripping film that almost literally winks at the camera without breaking the tension - and its timely social commentary never overburdens the suitably brisk running. Better than its been given credit for, it deserves an audience."
Assassination Nation,74,55,audience,This movie includes a trigger warning list at the beginning which seemed super in depth. So I felt good knowing I can prepare myself for the triggering scenes. This list included fragile masculinity but LEFT OUT SUICIDE. One of the first scenes is a guy shooting himself in the head. Seriously so upsetting. It would've been better if the list wasn't there so I didn't let my guard down.
Assassination Nation,74,55,audience,"It's ""The Purge"" through the lens of the guy that created ""Euphoria"" - but while the latest is a well written TV show, ""Assassination Nation"" is a pseudo-artistic hot mess, still worth watching while online shopping."
Assassination Nation,74,55,audience,One of mine's top 5 favorite movies. Literally so f*cking good!
Assassination Nation,74,55,audience,"it reminded me of Heathers, the 1989 cult classic featuring Winona Ryder And Christian Slater - and i LOVE Heathers."
Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
In-your-face stuff. A movie that is part slasher flick, part call for revolution.
 "
Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
The film turns itself on its head to show we all make mistakes... I really enjoyed this film.
 "
Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
Born and fuelled in the climate of #MeToo and #TimesUp, Assassination Nation is a timely examination on femininity, double standards and blame culture within the current cauldron of America's societal, political and ethical problems.
 "
Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
A living, breathing paradox of its time: a socially conscious yet aggressively anti-PC film that climaxes in an orgy of violence.
 "
Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
All the while, aesthetics reveal an infatuation with older movies . . . and revamp its more seminal inspirations into the overstimulation you'd find on a Tumblr gif set.
 "
Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
Part cyber thriller, horror, and revenge fantasy, Assassination Nation is an empowering film that slowly and deliberately cranks up the excitement until it peaks at an insane, yet enticing level.
 "
Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
Director Sam Levinson has managed to create a film that is both thought provoking and just straight forward provoking but despite the content warnings, it's not controversial.
 "
Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
Assassination Nation is as subtle as a baseball bat to the head. It's loud and angry ... Yet there's something completely cathartic in its deep nihilism.
 "

Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
Not one character I could root for amidst the overblown senseless violence. Tolerance is tested as the meaningless film tries way too hard for jaw drops with little substance.
 "
Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
What is Assassination Nation bringing to the table, that we don't already know? Parts of its shrill message therefore feel unconvincing, redundant, even dead on arrival.
 "
Assassination Nation,74,55,critic,"
Assassination Nation takes the Salem witch trials to the modern age - but gives the ""witches"" in question automatic weapons with which to fight back.

There's an undeniable satisfaction that comes from watching our heroines fight back, marching down the street in glossy red PVC jackets and armed to the teeth will swords, knives, and automatic weapons.

The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,audience,"Ho hum kooky kids movie with magic and other weird things. If it wasn't for the performances of Jack Black and the legendary(and not to mention, absolutely gorgeous) Cate Blanchett, I'd probably give this a 1 star. There's a scene near the end of the movie that shows a horrible looking CGI Jack Black baby that was just a big WTF moment."
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,audience,Cate Blanchett and Jack Black saved it to a certain degree... but that's about it.

The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,audience,The movie was okay.  The plot line was very dull but the actors lifted it to be bearable.
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,audience,"A avaliação é com base na falta de dublagem do filme! Se o produto é oferecido em meu país ele tem que ser pelo menos dublado, ou seja tem que ter ao menos duas opções!‼️"

The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,audience,Just scary and funny enough for the girls
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,audience,"Don't expect too much of it but I thought it was an enjoyable movie. Lots of CGI, good acting and I actually had to laugh a few times and, if you didn't know the word already, you learn the meaning of 'indomitable'."
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
Once The House With A Clock In Its Walls kicks in, it's good, silly fun, a throwback to the good time horror films of 1980s Amblin flicks.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
None of it is bad, really, it's just so uninspired.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
The story suffers from random uses of magic, which never have solid foundations or definitions, managing to be conjured up in the heat of the moment.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
A definite crowd-pleaser. Parents shouldn't get too bored and kids will love the humor and all of the effects and set pieces that go in to creating the film's magic.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
Barely rises above mediocrity on the strength of Blanchett's inspired performance.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
The beats are familiar, and there's something comforting about it, but ultimately isn't that involving and surprisingly a little bland.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
It's more like a kids' movie from the mid aughts than the golden age of Spielberg, poor CGI and all.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
Wackiness is used in place of actual jokes.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
Being such a fan of [author John] Bellairs, I was probably looking forward to The House with a Clock in Its Walls more than most this season, and I was not disappointed. It's the perfect fun family fright film for fall.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
Anyone who gives this a shot could be pleasantly surprised.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
Jack Black (playing the uncle) and Cate Blanchett (as his best friend and partner in magic) are usually welcome screen presences, but they seem embarrassed and undirected here, and the less said about the child actors, the better.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
The movie's saving grace, though, is in its two adult leads. Jack Black is Jack Black, he's funny as he always is, and has great chemistry with Vaccaro, but Blanchett's the real show stopper.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
Everything matters so very little, and doesn't even try to matter, that it's actually almost charming in a backward way.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
It's that pure unadulterated weirdness that makes The House with a Clock in Its Walls interesting to watch. Tonally, that's what the movie needed to commit to.

It's an interesting proposal for the whole family. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
The perfect horror film for kids. Engaging characters expertly written, with a playful sense of menace and dread lurking around every corner. A triumph.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
Fart jokes and head-butts aside, The House With a Clock in Its Walls might not warrant a massive franchise... But it'll do just fine in an early-fall box office as parents look for seasonally appropriate movies to send their middle schoolers to.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
It's sure to entertain younger audiences, while adults might be slightly amused. Characters feel contrived and the antagonist is weak, lacking a strong believable motivation
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
It's nice to have something new and fresh for kids.
 "
The House With a Clock in Its Walls,65,45,critic,"
At once fails as a scary tale for the young audience [Eli Roth is] clearly aiming for and as an enjoyable romp for the adults who will go along rather begrudgingly

Where Hands Touch,43,72,audience,"This film drags on a bit in part, but the actors do their best snd it shows. "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,audience,Actually I enjoyed this.  Although it was quite a hard watch at times.  It gives a side of WW2 that I for one hadn't really thought about.  I don't understand why so many negative views.  I can only assume that some people enjoy pulling a film to pieces rather than enjoying it for what it is.  I also noticed a high preponderance of reviews from men.  Maybe it's more of a woman's film.  But I would recommend it.
Where Hands Touch,43,72,audience,This is hands down one of the best movies i have seen this year. An absolute must see!
Where Hands Touch,43,72,audience,One of the finest movie and love story
Where Hands Touch,43,72,audience,This movie was absolutely phenomenal. It's willingness to play on a different perspective of the victim/perpetrator dynamic most movies about the Holocaust have is risky but paid off. It pulled every emotion out of me through Lena's journey and shed light on an unpopular group of people who were also affected by Hitler's regime. Please don't let anyone stop you from watching this movie. It's a must.
Where Hands Touch,43,72,audience,"The acting was great, the storyline doesn't seem to satisfy the audience or is the writing confusing? I'm still glad I watched it."
Where Hands Touch,43,72,audience,Amandla Sternberg is always a joy to watch. A delicate innocence that can move mountains. I never knew Afro-Germans existed in Hitler's Reich.
Where Hands Touch,43,72,audience,"So this movie had some sad moments. When i watch movies about slavery or the holocaust I just find it unbelievable that people actually existed and do exist that think that way. With that being said, it amazes me in a world where people are hated, Jews, Blacks or whatever they can still find it in themselves to hate each other it’s so ridiculous it’s laughable. In this movie this girl is so naive, almost to the point of stupid I’d i have a hard time feeling sorry for her at times. Wanting to be a part of a country that hates her, having the nerve to look down on people as she is looked down as if she doesn’t see she is being treated the exact same way she is treating others. It’s is ignorant. It goes on to be a little to predictable with the pregnancy and the guy ending up at her particular camp. It just becomes silly after awhile. This actress barely spoke through the entire movie and spent most of the time hiding around corners.🤷🏽‍♀️"
Where Hands Touch,43,72,audience,"The movie was beautiful. Characters were well developed and you could feel the depth of the story being told. To have suffered like these people suffered, in a time where hope didn't seem to exist. It is a history that should never be forgotten. Thank you for making this movie,"
Where Hands Touch,43,72,audience,"This film perfectly explores the nuances of what being human is. The pressures and influences societies and parents have on children are shown through every characters struggle with how they fit in the deranged world they are meant to support as Germans. It brings up parts of history that the Eurocentric view glosses over. It also humanizes the Nazi. Which is important. Because the scariest thing about people who are filled with hate is that they once weren't. And that they are not so different from us. It's an important showcase in how judging the actions of a whole group based either on the few or the many is absolutely hypocritical. The context matters. If we despise one group because ""all of them are monsters"" it makes us no better than what we are fighting against. Nazis today, are evil. Nazis then, included some terrified bystanders, those who lacked the courage to do what is right, for which they hated themselves, those who did what they could for others while going unnoticed, and children caught up in their parents world of bigotry. While there were an overwhelming number of evil nazis, it is vital for our future that we acknowledge the ‘everyday' people who got swept up in this and allowed it to happen. This movie touches that perfectly. Absolutely beautiful. It's not surprising that it got some negative reviews, as many people initially dislike whatever challenges their worldview. But our society grow from learning about things that make us uncomfortable."
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
Where Hands Touch still manages to be a well-acted historical drama that depicts World War II from a different point of view. It also retains the same theme of finding your identity that Amma Asante has demonstrated in her previous work.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
It is Leyna's relationship with her mother (and her own identity) that is perhaps the most moving aspect of the film. Amandla Stenberg gives a fantastic performance here as a young woman who is struggling to find her place in the world.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
Possibly with a different screenwriter, or even a different cast, Where Hands Touch might have been something truly great. Unfortunately, as it is, it's very middle ground fare that neither moves, engages, or informs - it simply exists.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
While Where Hands Touch has its tender moments, and manages to draw some teary eyes, its central romance becomes more outlandish as the film progresses, becoming borderline distasteful.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
Where Hands Touch certainly doesn't deserve its viral meme infamy - it's a far more nuanced movie than that suggests - but it also will not join the pantheon of its director's finest moments.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
I found myself looking at it and liking certain parts, but I didn't get emotionally swept up...but it great that the film happened, in itself there's a sense of relief and triumph there...
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
In a disappointing turn from Asante, an important and vital narrative is lost in a bizarre and over-dramatic love story.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
A frustratingly wasted opportunity.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
It's a fascinating take on the horrors of World War II and one that confirms [Amandla] Stenberg as one of the most accomplished rising stars of her generation.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
If Asante's idea is that Nazi ideology poisoned bright young minds into viewing their fellow citizens as less than human, the lovey-dovey bond she's pushing as the main event seems even more implausible.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
The film gives us elements of melodrama and also of epic - yet there is also something a little uncomfortable about it.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
Where Hands Touch is ultimately let down by a deeply contrived narrative and tone-deaf melodramatic style which only serves to diminish the importance and urgency of the real life stories behind Assante's screenplay.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
Patchy acting, questionable accents and a clunky screenplay that tamely wends its way down a lazy river of fawning predictability, further hamper a film that screams for the authenticity and inventiveness of Asante's previous directorial outings.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
Dramatically it's a mixed bag, but Where Hands Touch does offer some moments of magic.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
Casting Amandla Stenberg as Leyna in the starring role was an excellent choice.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
It isn't the implausibility of the script which causes this film's failure, it's the inability to create complex or practical characters from these fragments of reality.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
While Asante's earlier films were grounded in reality and successfully linked the problems facing their protagonists to contemporary aspects of racism, Where Hands Touch seems unduly contrived.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
In the end it feels like a school play, and not a very good one.
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
The performances are affecting, particularly George MacKay... deft direction...
 "
Where Hands Touch,43,72,critic,"
With such a film as Where Hands Touch, and with the times we are living in, with the alt-right being validated by our current president, the film would have made a much stronger point if it focused on biracial Germans without a Nazi love interest.

Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,61,30,audience,I remember watching this movie but its all a forgettable blur and it made me have an identity crisis.
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,61,30,audience,"No, I'm sorry.
This movie is a big no.
What Sierra Burgess does is simply wrong but it gets somehow romanticized and made seem like it's okay.
It's. Just. Not. Okay.
Shannon Purser does an amazing job though.
Noah Centineo is as lovely as always in his teen-rom-com parts.
Kristine Froseth is a pleasant discovery on the acting scene, a discovery for me at least.
But still... the movie is a big no for the message that it tries to convey.

Sierra Burgess IS a loser. Not in a stereotypical way: she is a loser for what she does, which is definitely not okay. In 2021, we can do better than this.
Let's hope that this movie will at least be a starting point to initiate a discussion on catfishing and consent."
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,61,30,audience,"Sierra Burgers is loser teaches that it doesn't matter what you do, your actions have no consequences. She comited a crime and at the end everyone forgave her. That doesn't make any sense."
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,61,30,audience,"This shit is so retarded. The fucking director is a moron, like who the fuck would give a catfish a good ending. Are you retarded, she does not deserve a good ending. She's a manipulative, gas-lighting motherfucking piece of shit who hacked into someone's instagram to bully them. She even kissed someone without consent. I would sue the fuck out of this dumb bitch fucking ugly piece of insecure BREAd."
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,61,30,audience,The main character is horrible person who we're meant to sympathize with and ends up WINNING in the end.
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,61,30,audience,"It was bad, Sierra was so unliekable and the ""mean"" girl deserved better."
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,61,30,audience,"very boring, film made for teenagers with a bad taste for art"
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,61,30,audience,"First, the good....
I'm glad that I decided to give ""Sierra"" a chance and watch it all the way through, because I was thisclose to giving up on it all together. Three stars is honestly kind of generous, but most of those are for the main character. You can't help but like her. And I loved the friendship she formed with a very unlikely person. OMG, how cool to have Lea Thompson and Alan Ruck playing her parents! That was a totally awesome 80's moment and IMO makes the movie worth seeing. All of the performances were great and although the movie isn't hilarious, there are some pretty moments. 
Now the bad... 
Why, if the entire point of the movie is movie is heavily reliant on the two main characters texting back and forth, would you not want to highlight the texts (ie: via voiceovers or subtitles on the screen) instead of forcing the viewer to try to read them off of the character's phones? This is why I almost gave up on it, because I honestly had no idea what they were saying to each other! It was only when they started making phone calls that the movie really began to interest me. There are a few other movies (""You've Got Mail"" and ""A Cinderella Story"" to name a few) that had a similar theme,  but they used voice overs to convey the messages to the viewer. How are you supposed to even understand what's being typed if you can't read it?
Another thing was the ""secrecy"" factor. It was cute at first but some of it was downright ridiculous. I mentioned before that Sierra was a likeable character. Well, she was until she does something incredibly mean and stupid to someone else. I get that it was revenge, but it was way over the top and of course the movie's ending was typical. Honestly I think she should have gotten what she deserved. 
Anyway, as I said before, I'm glad I watched it all the way through. It does have some moments that made it worth it."
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,61,30,audience,"Once you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all and this one only has the addition of technology. "
Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,61,30,audience,The concept of this movie shows horrible morals to start with but the way they try to convince you that this is okay makes it even worse. They show lying to the extreme then they show a non concenial kiss and after that the protagonist also spreads personal information about a friend to the whole entire school and she is forgiven just because she wrote a song that was pretty average and sents it to them. And just because she is 'ugly and insecure' according to the movie which isn't an excuse for her terrible behavior she just gets forgiven for everything! She even gets the guy she's been catfishing the whole entire movie and she kissed without his permission and he's totally fine with that in the end. This sends a horrible message to young people and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Its heart is in the right place and it really focuses on the insecurities women can face with regards to body image and the need to be seen as perfect, but its delivery leaves much to be desired.

The Mummy,16,35,audience,This movie looks stupid as hell. How do people like these films?
The Mummy,16,35,audience,"I thought the 3rd was fuckin bad .. but this is an insult to Tom cruise to be honest , non of it follows from the first films , Brendan frasier is the only main guy apart from the 3rd wich was crap .. they need to stop with these reboots shit start new ideas"
The Mummy,16,35,audience,This movie was rather dark compared to the Brendan Frazier movie also titled the same.  This was a different type role for Tom Cruise.  The movie still had action.  I'm not sure what the writers of this movie where trying to do with this one.
The Mummy,16,35,audience,I really hate this film.
The Mummy,16,35,audience,So fun and nice to watch. Very good and interesting.
The Mummy,16,35,audience,"A good start to the Dark Universe reboot of the classic Universal horror movies. It's not your typical mummy movie but rather leads down a darker path than its predecessors.  There's horror, humor and some serious plot twists. Grab some popcorn and enjoy."
The Mummy,16,35,audience,Sorry Tom Cruise but you or Russel Crowe couldn't save this dark universe.  It's a bit of a bore.
The Mummy,16,35,audience,"A disappointment.

'The Mummy' begins with promise. I initially enjoyed the duo of Tom Cruise and Jake Johnson, the plot set-up and the location choice of London. Russell Crowe is a standout name too. However, sadly, the film gets progressively worse throughout the 110 minutes.

The premise kinda just falls into itself, with any interest disappearing pretty quickly. The link between Cruise and Johnson becomes tiresome, as does all the comedy in the film in truth - there's a few chuckles, but nothing laugh worthy. The zombie vibe doesn't fit, either.

What also doesn't help is the fact they're blatantly trying to set up a film universe of some sort, which they put too much focus on. I found the effects hit-and-miss, I feel like they could've used more practical stuff rather than relying so much on CGI - for the make-up et al. at least.

Cruise leads ably and does a decent enough job - he has done far greater of course. Crowe never really gets going in my opinion, though does have a couple of cool to look at scenes late on. Sofia Boutella is alright, as is Annabelle Wallis. A meh for the cast.

Nothing diabolical, but a fair distance from good too."
The Mummy,16,35,audience,"Seemed like it could have been a good movie if only they had steered away from it being just another vehicle for Tom Cruise to love and adore himself. Actually, if you did away with Tom Cruise and Alex Kurtzman you might just get a decent movie."
The Mummy,16,35,audience,"An action-packed fun frolicking adventure ... not. It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not adventurous, it's not camp it's not ... well it's just not anything really. These new kick start the dollar franchise movies should have a look at the old Hammer Horrors. Don't waste your life on this one."

To All the Boys I've Loved Before,96,86,audience,"A teen rom-com that is formulaic in its delivery, but has such a good cast, with engaging characters, and a good story, that it feels quite refreshing. Not a mind-blowing movie, but good enough to rate it 4* because of the aforementioned qualities"
To All the Boys I've Loved Before,96,86,audience,"It's a little overdramatic and it doesn't come across as a portrayal of organic situations, not to mention the sole focus on the romantic relationship in a story centred on a female lead. What I enjoyed about it were the few scenes in which they show their family dynamic, the importance of cultural background and diversity in our family traditions - if you blink during the film, you might miss it though."
To All the Boys I've Loved Before,96,86,audience,"Esattamente come dovrebbero essere le commedie liceali, fresche e divertenti. C'è un'ottima sintonia tra tutti i membri del cast ma il ragazzo protagonista dimostra a gran voce una spontaneità incredibile che lo vede in un ruolo che gli calza alla perfezione. A volte è più che sdolcinato e si adagia su alcuni aspetti che abbiamo già visto e rivisto, ma è totalmente accettabile, visto che si tratta di una sorta di clausola che accompagna proprio il genere a cui il film appartiene. Nel complesso un'esperienza più che positiva."
To All the Boys I've Loved Before,96,86,audience,"Well, this is really good. 'To All The Boys I've Loved Before' is a great movie, also is a very good romantic teen movie, the script have great dialogues, the story subvert some cliches of the genre and narrative is really good to invest the time into it. I loved the performances of Lana Condor (sweet, cute and very charismatic) and Noah Centineo, the duo have a great chemistry that sparks every single time they're share the screen. The cast is very solid and Kitty is probably the best supporting character ever. Overall is a good romantic comedy and maybe one of the best teenage movies of the recently memory."
To All the Boys I've Loved Before,96,86,audience,Fun movie with intense (though over stated) drama. Nothing special but gentle and fun. Would recommend for a cozy night.
To All the Boys I've Loved Before,96,86,audience,"Yeah, i didnt like the main guy the whole time so thats probabley why i didnt like that ending."
To All the Boys I've Loved Before,96,86,audience,"Bad camera work and so many plot holes, things happen with no pay off or reason for happening (ex: scrunchie scene) or moments in the movie felt like they were just ticking off a checklist for a romance movie like ""okay we need to have a scene where the dad and daughter talk about the dead mom..."" and even though this scene would have explained a lot and if done well, made you feel emotional connections to the family and how they are, I felt nothing as the scene was rushed and the emotion experienced by both characters felt so empty. I imagine if the death of your mother/wife was so impactful that it's brought up a couple times in the story or even avoided all together because of how traumatizing it was, having a lighthearted conversation in a restaurant would be difficult to get through. I don't know, a lot of things in this movie follow this structure where what's happening on screen is supposed to make me feel very connected and invested but it's done so quickly or the acting is off, that I don't feel anything. The cheap ""inconveniences that lead to misunderstandings"" type of stuff you see in a lot of romance movies, was very predictable and the mean girl/quirky best friend characters were over the top and exaggerated. The thing is, if you do this in some movies, it works... If the world around these actions is just as wacky and goofy or the movie wasn't trying to take on this serious tone half the time, then it could have worked but going from this mean character who's straight out of a disney channel show and then having somber/mature/serious moments directly after is too much. I felt like I was watching a Disney Channel original movie, but based on the high praise it received, I expected a lot more. Seeing this on the top 100 romance movies list here on RT is was propelled me to even sign into face book and leave this review. 

Also one last thing, characters seem to get over and grieve quickly when something happens. Like the scene I stated above, or how the main characters ""nudes"" leak and her sister is able to fix it within seconds, no consequences. Or how the younger sister sends the letters in the first place and then she does nothing redeemable in the rest of the movie. I found her so annoying because of this and again, it just drew away from the emotional impact of so many things that happened. The story structure of this movie reminds me of fanfiction I used to read when I was 14 where the most popular guy in school would fall for the nerdy outcast but the thing is, in 2019 you expect more from this trope. You want to see more and while this trope is great especially to romance lovers, making it completely unoriginal and then lacking to telescope on important things like, how the mothers death really affects the main character and her family or how the two main love interests can have issues being together that aren't just misunderstandings of convenient plot devices that could easily be resolved if the characters communicated better... Anyways. When I watch a movie I don't like, I normally can get over it and be like this wasn't for me, but seeing this movie so highly regarded confuses me a lot."
To All the Boys I've Loved Before,96,86,audience,"Ok listen guys, a lot of people are giving this movie a lot of praise, and I'm not one to shit on anyone's opinion or anything, but holy fuck this movie SUCKED. I thought I was watching a porno from the amount of sucking that went on in this god damn film Jesus christ. I read someone said that they really appreciated the ""REFRESHING WAY THE CAHRECTERS WHERE PRESENTED"". BITCH WHAT. These characters were about a refreshing as an 80-year-olds pussy. The number of fucking cliches crammed within 30 seconds would make you think you're watching someone do a pov tik tok. Speaking of Tik Tok, I swear to god I've seen better acting from the Bussit challenge than I saw from this movie. I know it wasn't a porno because porn has better acting, and at least the end of pornos are satisfying. This piece of shit ended with them kissing at a blown-out angle as the drone pilot they used to invade Syria with slowly flew away. Fuck this piece of shit trash film I could feel my eyes drafting suicide letters to my brain as I watched. I would rate it negative stars if I could."

The Man Who Invented Christmas,79,77,audience,"Less interested in being a biopic and more interested in being a look at the writing process and something of a loose adaptation of A Christmas Carol in it's own right, The Man Who Invented Christmas works surprisingly well.  The general bullet points of Dickens life and how the story came to be are, for the most part, represented here.  However, some of them are certainly exaggerated or at the very least shuffled around.  To the larger point, the film uses the unique narrative device of having Dickens literally see his characters come to life and discuss their personalities with him.  Was this true to him?  Who knows, but it's a fascinating look at the creation process and that's really where the story shines brightest.  Having Scrooge talk to him about the type of person he is or have the characters torment him in his day-to-day life is intriguing as hell.  It also works in a lot of ways as a loose adaptation of A Christmas Carol.  First of all there's just the fact that Christopher Plummer could actually be a great Scrooge in a genuine adaptation because he really nails the character (except for one key scene).  There's also the way it uses some great staging choices like having a statue in London come to life as the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come to show Dickens's inspiration, but it's such a great visual I'd love to see this in real Christmas Carol adaptation.  Beyond that though, Dickens life parallels Scrooge's in a lot of ways, and he does better himself through the film.  Again, how true is this?  Who's to say.  Historians I guess, but that's beside the point.  As a film, it works, and it's quite a delightful little Christmas film and an inspirational look at the storytelling process."

The Man Who Invented Christmas,79,77,audience,Rating: 8/10. 83/100
The Man Who Invented Christmas,79,77,audience,"This movie could have been so cheesy, but, instead, it has the potential to become a Christmas classic — or, at least, a must-see — albeit on a tier lower than the classic on which it is based. It could have been made to be cloyingly heady, but this story—of how Dickens wrote ""A Christmas Carol""— retains its sobriety through the steady, assured direction and highly credible character-performances."
The Man Who Invented Christmas,79,77,audience,I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Ok it's a fantasy of a small part of Dickens' life but it's really cleverly done with the ghosts of Christmas interacting with Dickens and his fantasy of Scrooge who also interact. Was the redemption of Scrooge really a late idea for Dickens? I liked the way it was portrayed how Dickens got his ideas for A Christmas Carol even though that is fantasy as well. An original and different way of treating a familiar subject.

Again, though, the cars are great (good to see a British Racing Green F Type for Statham), things go bang and driving really really fast as a gang can indeed save the world.

"I, Tonya",90,88,audience,It is very good and I like it a lot.
"I, Tonya",90,88,audience,"A wonderful biopic with a rockstar cast. I was consistently impressed with how funny and almost light-hearted the vast majority of the movie is, despite the incredibly dark story that it's telling. Margot Robbie absolutely shines as Tonya Harding and the crew did an excellent job of making her look like she's a teenager for a lot of scenes. Allison Janney also deserves a mention as Tonya's rude but engaging mother as she fights Robbie for the spotlight in every scene they share. The skating choreography is quite impressive as well (although my competitive-figure-skating girlfriend repeatedly informed that they were only doing double-axels, not triple). Overall, I, Tonya is a powerful and hilarious film that can be enjoyed even by folks who aren't familiar with ""the incident""."
"I, Tonya",90,88,audience,Is there such thing as a perfect movie? Because I think this might be one
"I, Tonya",90,88,audience,Excellent.  A story I didn't  that had so much depth. Watch it!
"I, Tonya",90,88,audience,"Tonya Harding is definitely Margot Robbie's best performance to date. Along with an amazing supporting cast, a good story, and a great sense of humor, I, Tonya is a wildly entertaining and memorable sports film."
"I, Tonya",90,88,audience,It spins from very emotional to funny. Go for it.
"I, Tonya",90,88,audience,Watched it this morning and can't get the movie out of my head. I think every part of the movie was made with much talent and understandig of the story. I really feel bad for Tonya because what she has been through happens on many levels with too many people and other beings.
"I, Tonya",90,88,audience,A beautiful performance
"I, Tonya",90,88,audience,Margot deserves all the praise. Janey is superb as always. We know the story but it does an excellent job of making us think there's always more to it. 
"I, Tonya",90,88,audience,The acting by the entire cast in this film is incredible and is what really makes this film great.
"I, Tonya",90,88,critic,"
It's messy, but this is a messy story about a woman who paid a heavy price for daring to be herself. Not conforming cost her everything but you get a sense, by the end of the film, it's a price she was willing to pay.

Comedy-drama documentary about the rise and fall of Tonya Harding, the American figure-skater. It sounds like a simple sports biopic, and honestly, the story is much more complex.

Robbie, Janney, Stan, and Gillespie really nailed this tale by going for broke and giving the bittersweet true story a fair dose of punk rock rebellion.

"I, Tonya",90,88,critic,"
Regardless of your take on the morality of its conceit, the film is so undeniably compelling and well-crafted that it remains a must-see experience. It's not a typical Oscar contender; it's a gritty underdog that might just stick the landing.

"I, Tonya",90,88,critic,"
Under all the format gimmicks and stylization, the meta-references and winks at the audience, there is a real heart to this story. When Tonya falls apart at the 1994 Olympics, or breaks down after having skating taken away, her pain is palpable.

Director Craig Gillespie has reinvented the biopic, a notoriously dreary genre, by striking a hair-trigger balance between trauma and parody, mockumentary and melodrama, demolishing the fourth wall.

Mute,21,47,audience,"Watched this movie on mushrooms. I think what all the negative reviews complain about, are the best part of this movie. It doesn't have the stereotypical story line and explanations. Anyway, my mind was blown and I've watched everything sci-fi you can imagine. Not sure if it was the best or worst experience I've had, but interesting for sure. I also felt a lot of political (and other) undertones to the movie as well, but may have just been me. Enjoy if you can."
Mute,21,47,audience,"Full of unnecessary scenes completely disconnected from one another that don't help the story progression in any way. Full of characters with no depth whatsoever - the viewer struggles the entire movie to understand their motives without ever reaching a consensus. Visually appealing, shallow in character and story."
Mute,21,47,audience,"'Mute' is enjoyable for what it is... and anyone seeking deeper meaning, or for it to transcend the movie craft is asking too much"
Mute,21,47,audience,"Great cast. It's worth watching because it asks uncomfortable questions about the objectification of women and what a dangerous place the world is for most women, from a very young age. Apart from that it is very long, dark and quite depressing, with a  convoluted storyline."
Mute,21,47,audience,"A lot better than Duncan Jones' ""Warcraft"", but not even close to as good as it's blood relative ""Moon"" or ""Source Code"". There's gorgeous direction, a wild story, and a freaky yet sympathetic A-list cast. This movie owns how much of a Blade Runner-esc weirdo it is. Super flawed and dissapointing, but could've been MUCH worse. I'm glad it has a subversive turn from Paul Rudd and that the story is equally unpredictable. It's one of the better Netflix Original films, but that's not saying much. 7.5/10"
Mute,21,47,audience,"Alexander Skarsgard always attracts attention when in a film, It's a shame his role never managed to hold the attention for it was boring and lacking flavour. 
The cinematography alone is stunning with its bright, futuristic reality! Unfortunately what the rest of the movie has to offer is anything but excitement. 
I thought we were in for a [John Wick] styled treat - full of vicious fight scenes. Instead Leo was beaten senseless. A very big step down from the badass we were all expecting."
Mute,21,47,audience,"Alexander Skarsgård plays an exhaustingly dull, table-leg-wielding, mute protagonist in a remarkably dour sci-fi full of neon lights, irrational character choices and unsatisfying reveals. Paul Rudd's moustache and Justin Theroux's wig can only carry the film so far."
Mute,21,47,audience,"The basic plot here is a 'solve the mystery find the girl' noir film kind of deal.  Much of the rest of the film is window dressing.  The 'gumshoe' in this case is a fish out of water Amish dude (Skarsgard - well know for his multiple dumpster fires like 'Tarzan' and 'Hold the Dark') who can't speak because... well, reasons.  I can't think of any reason why the protagonist should be either Amish or mute - it doesn't add anything other than now I guess he gets to beat people with genuine Amish furniture.  Maybe he is mute so he gets to show all his emotion with his face muscles?  Acting!  Genius!  Thank you!
Anyway, he goes through the usual underbelly of the city scenes looking for clues and interacting with all the scumbags (apparently the entire city of Berlin consists of sex workers), getting roughed up along the way.  Instead of a 40s noir feel, they did the futuristic Blade Runner thing - again, for no apparent reason.
Eventually, he comes across main baddies Cactus Bill and he pedo friend Duck, who have basically been almost a separate movie until the threads come together.  Bad things ensue - some of which make sense and some of which, well, to put it kindly, don't.
Paul Rudd is kind of a high point.  He is the only character that is at all animated, everyone else acting like extras in 1984.  He should actually get two credits - one for him and one for his porn mustache. 
This film isn't the worst film I have ever seen - not even the worst noir film.  But the plot is almost lost under all the stylings and visuals and general business of the film, and the only character that elicits any sympathy is Rudd, when he probably shouldn't."
Mute,21,47,audience,An extremely meaningless and meandering script cannot be saved by a Blade Runner-light aesthetic. Had much higher hopes for Duncan Jones.
Mute,21,47,audience,Nothing what I was expecting. This movie goes completely off the plot of the movie. It's like Paul Rudd wanted to play a bad guy so they let him run wild. No real story line at all and what the hell is with the drinking of water and the weird surgeries?! Save yourself over 2 hours and don't watch it. Makes no sense and is weird
Mute,21,47,critic,"
A frustrating, bewildering and nonsensical disappointment that offers little that feels new and fails to craft a mystery that sparks intrigue in a world that feels hazily defined.
 "
Mute,21,47,critic,"
I see it as a positive that films like this can be released and they won't please everyone, but are at least experimental and interesting. I would encourage people to give it a chance, particularly if you have enjoyed modern-day twists on noir.

For as debased and violent as Mute is, it's also incredibly cerebral and Netflix encourages the kind of online social engagement that cultivates discussion.

There are great ideas and some incredible design on display that have to contend with aspects of the script and story that might've been better excised.

But every time a writer-director with the name recognition of Jones delivers a work of this level, it only serves to prove those risk-averse studio executives right.

Slow and listless, lacking tension or a sense of danger, it's a pastiche with aspirations to being a movie that ends up a very expensive pageant.

If films like this stop being funded altogether in favour of crowd-pleasers rather than crowd-challengers, we're damned. That's your most plausible dystopian future, folks.

One of those frustrating movies that starts off well and gradually goes off the rails. And after a two hour investment, it delivers a spectacularly underwhelming payoff.
 "
"Love, Simon",91,88,audience,"Not a masterpiece, but almost there... this film is a miracle, playing with the conventions of the average teenage love dramedy, but with unbelievable love for characters and their dynamics, avoiding making them one-dimensional and with a cast in which no one ever fails, always finding the perfect tone. A must see, and not only for LGTB audiences..."
"Love, Simon",91,88,audience,"I am torn apart about this one, as I am struggling with the premise and it's execution and authenticity. Love, Simon's premise is that it is the first ever coming of age romcom by a major Hollywood studio, with a gay love story in its center.

Overall I think that it succeeds at being an enjoyable, feel-good, heartwarming teenage romcom. The story is somewhat intriguing, the soundtrack is good and I don't have any problems with the acting. There are a few heartwarming scenes, especially in connection to the coming out and it is just an overall feel-good movie experience made for everyone. 

But this is where it gets tricky for me. It is made for everyone, but I feel like ""everyone"" in this case, simply means ""middle-class straight people or children"". To me the movie begs the question, how much LGBTQ+ representation it actually offers, both on screen and behind the camera, thus making me question the stories authenticity. While watching it, I just couldn't shake the feeling that it was written by middle-aged, middle-class straight people that try to tell a story about how a teenager, coming to terms with his sexuality supposedly feels, without actually really understanding any of it, nor understanding what being a Highschool student today is really like. 
After all the book that the movie is an adaptation of, was written by a woman, that's married with children, to a man. And while she eventually did (with somewhat questionable authenticity) realise she was bisexual, after some confusion about her being a straight woman, writing a coming out story, it just really makes me question the authenticity of this whole thing. Not to mention that Simon's actor is played by a  straight man (Nick Robinson), who is as most of the ""teenage"" cast, nowhere near the age of a Highschool student. 

As a gay young adult, I feel somewhat wronged by the movie and it's almost too perfect depiction of the whole topic. It is just your average teenage romcom, where the main character happens to not be straight. He does not seem to at all struggle with his sexuality, apart from him not wanting others to see him differently. His liberal, loving family and all his friends (to the surprise of nobody), accept him immediately and he even has his happy end. It simply is as good as it gets and nothing less. With hardly any LGBTQ+ representation within the cast and main crew (with about 2 or 3 exceptions), cliche filled storylines, a very basic understanding of what its like being a gay Highschool student and a lot of topics left untouched, they get away with doing the bare minimum. 

I see a lot of reviews by middle-aged, straight parents watching the movie with their kids, writing what great of a movie this is and how touched they were and what a great message it has. And that is sadly, exactly who in my opinion this movie is eventually for, even though it shouldn't be. 

Ultimately I have to say that I am glad this movie at least exists but it is just generally a missed opportunity for the first major production movie based on a gay love story to include as much LGBTQ+ representation as possible or at least more than the minimal effort they have put into this. I personally would have wished for more authenticity and diversity in sexual and gender orientation, within the casting and the writing. For me the story is too good to be true and just simply not believable, therefore making it nothing more than an average, feel-good teenage romcom."
"Love, Simon",91,88,audience,Great movie for the newer generation of LGBTQ+ kids and teens. 
"Love, Simon",91,88,audience,"2021-2-18 Maybe Blue  was worried about many things, but ending a relationship by leaving a message was one of the worst suck things in  the world. The person who treated you with all his heart deserved a sincerely conversation. The father was so handsome."
"Love, Simon",91,88,audience,"i'm not gonna lie, i thought this film was pretentious the first time around making you guess who the heck blue is. but once you know, it's actually a pretty enjoyable movie outside of that focus"
"Love, Simon",91,88,audience,All the stars! The dad’s process (short scene) is how I’d hope all dads process when their child comes out. 
"Love, Simon",91,88,audience,"Love this movie.  I bought it so that when I want to watch a funny, well put together story, I have it on hand.  The acting is great, the story line draws you in and the movie is just altogether fun.  I smile when thinking about it and the whole time I am watching it."
"Love, Simon",91,88,audience,"One of the best coming of age films since The Perks Of Being A Wallflower! Love, Simon introduces some incredible young actors that have sensational careers ahead of them, led by a spectacular Nick Robinson. A must see!"
"Love, Simon",91,88,audience,"Overall, Love, Simon is a very heart-warming coming of age film that hits the right notes when it needs. The final part of the film is certainly my favourite as it concludes Simon's story in the nicest possible way. Yes, it isn't perfect, it has many cheesy moments that sometimes take the emotion out of some scenes for me, but this is such as a feel-good watch, and has a 21 year old straight male, I absolutely loved this! Special mention to Nick Robinson as Simon as well, he was brilliant and fully immersed himself into the role.

Skyscraper,48,69,audience,"Every moment of Skyscraper seems meticulously calculated to be as safe as possible. The action sequences, while well shot, never feel too dangerous or too violent.

Lovely, feel good story where you actually enjoy all of the main characters which is hard to come by in the traditional romantic comedy genre of late.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
As a showcase for two actors who more than deserve their moment to shine, Set It Up is hugely satisfying. As a modern romantic comedy, it's glorious.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
Set it Up is the perfect example of a broad romantic comedy done right. It adheres to the formula for the most part but isn't afraid to break it. It has its own style and moves to beat of its own drum.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
(Written by Amanda Keats) A fun and endearing film that feels like both a throwback to the beloved rom coms of the 90s and something new, fresh and exciting.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
Set It Up's visual representation of assistant horror stories and New York City romance is a fun start to the summer for couples who want to take their date nights in.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
It exists as a canny tribute to the rom-coms of yesteryear, hitting a sweet, nostalgic feel-good spot.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
Lucy Liu is also good as an ice queen boss that gets more character development than the trope typically allows.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
The writing and performances make Set It Up a fun watch with cute moments that may have reference-worthy potential in popular culture.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
An ideal feel-good, laugh-out-loud rom-com.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
Though the set-up itself could have come straight from a cheap contemporary romance novel, the execution elevates the film.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
The story is generic and predictable, but what's the harm in an easy-to-swallow rom-com that makes you feel good?
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
Set It Up is one of Netflix's latest original films, and one of its best attempts. A tribute to the romantic comedies of yesteryear, Set it Up is filled with some modern twists, but it remains simple and sweet enough for a wide audience to enjoy.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
It's the best version of what a Netflix movie should be. ... Overall, Set It Up is the most delightful way one could spend a lazy afternoon or cozy date night in.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
...a refreshingly antiquated romcom that delivers exactly what it promises.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
Director Claire Scanlon...gets everyone leaning into their roles, and Deutch is a particular delight.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
The premise is fun...it's great.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
It's calculative matchmaking, but not entirely genuine. Consequentially, the narrative appears more custom-made than it already is.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
At a run-time of an hour and forty-five minutes, the fast pace of the film never drops as the momentum is held by the energetic spirits of both Powell and Deutch.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
Claire Scanlon's Manhattan meet-cute is a bouncy comedy with plenty to say about modern relationships.
 "
Set It Up,92,67,critic,"
Set It Up is an example of what not to do - do not cast the charismatic, fabulously dressed Lucy Liu if you do not have a movie worthy of her talents.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,audience,"Loved Lara Croft with Angelina Jolie: Great fun, sexy Angelina, a great team and a high popcorn rating.

This Tomb Raider is more a warmed up Indiana Jones from 30 years ago, with characters I can't care about.

Put this crap fest back in the Tomb! Forever!"
Tomb Raider,52,55,audience,"As a fan of the video game reboot series, I didn't expect to be awesomely entertained. This expectation was met. Although I didn't hate anything about the movie, nothing absolutely blew me away. It was a mediocre experience, but still an enjoyable watch - even though I would have liked to have seen the video game references that were already in it used more.
To say a few words about the acting - it was good across the board, and at the end, Alicia Vikander delivered a satisfactory performance.
In conclusion: If you don't have anything to watch, knock yourself out. It's an okay movie, and I'd be open to see a sequel, because I'm absolutely positive that the Tomb Raider franchise has some banger material for live-action cinema."
Tomb Raider,52,55,audience,"While I had high hopes for this movie both the director and the actress did nothing but create a movie that flopped. Not only was the plot seriously confusing as they combined two of the video games to try to make a movie. The actress was seriously unbelievable as a young Lara Croft. I have no idea if she's ever actes before but she shouldn't be looking into the camera 😂
Also i have never seen Laura Croft cry so much. Even in the video game she didn't cry as much, I can't even believe you guys are going to make a sequel off that. Angelina Jolie was way better."
Tomb Raider,52,55,audience,It may not be the adaptation that the fans of the games might have dreamt of but it still manages to be an enjoyable action adventure movie.
Tomb Raider,52,55,audience,"Lara Croft's reboot slowly but surely got me back into Tomb Raider. The newest game may have been bad and all but this movie still got me into the spirit. If your a fan of mindless action fun, give this a watch."
Tomb Raider,52,55,audience,That's no Laura Croft more like a low budget  knock off.
Tomb Raider,52,55,audience,"Alicia Vikander is really-really good in this movie. She carries this film. Watch, to witness a true talent act her butt off. Replay value; moderate, the movie feels like a video game as it should."
Tomb Raider,52,55,audience,"The background story of Lara Croft, the famous antique hunter, based on a game.
It all starts with Lara, a girl who works as a courier and doesn't want to believe that her father, who went missing seven years ago, is dead. After discovering her father's old papers, the girl goes to the cursed island to discover the most important truth of what happened to her father. The main role was played by Alicia Vikander, I am not familiar with her work, but in this role she was good. In her performance, Lara Croft turned out to be so gentle and strong, feminine and obstinate. And although I have nothing against Alicia, but for me Jolie looked better and more spectacular in this role.
I'm of the opinion that the plot was fast-paced  and breath-taking. But it would seem to my friend that  the film was complex and disappointing. Although the whole film was kept in suspense, the desire to find out what was hidden on the island became more and more.
The disclosure of the secret led to an unexpected result. It was quite exciting to watch, and if a sequel is removed, I will definitely watch it."
Tomb Raider,52,55,audience,I think it's a great movie for the people who didn't play the video games of tomb raider. I love the storyline.
Tomb Raider,52,55,audience,"It is difficult to look at this film with a 100% critical eye, given that I am a huge fan of the game. But this adaptation left something to be desired in creativity and originality, making it kind of dull."
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
The story and action are fairly generic but Vikander carries the day, reshaping a character we already thought we knew.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
It boasts thrilling action sequences that not only nod to the video game origins, but also stand on their own as expertly choreographed stunts.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
Vikander's the reason the reboot doesn't feel like a tacked on moneymaking exercise. The Oscar-winning actress is the real deal and powers this flick.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
Academy Award-winner Alicia Vikander is a much stronger Lara Croft than Jolie.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
""Tomb Raider"" was better when it was ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.""
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
[Tomb Raider is] really two films: one swift, crackling, and pretty fun; and the other generic, illogical, and seemingly interminable.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
It is completely, exactly, and absolutely ok.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
At times, it's exciting and adventurous...Other times, though, the movie feels like it's treading water, waiting for the next thrilling set-piece to come into Lara's path.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
It captures the adventurous essence of the videogame. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
Vikander and director Uthaug do a worthy job of bringing out the flawed, human qualities of Lara without taking anything away from her as a bona fide action hero.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
It's a pretty bland affair, made with all the craft of, well, a video game cut scene.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
Roar Uthaug (The Wave) directed; his work feels derivative of Steven Spielberg's first two Indiana Jones movies, though not half as entertaining.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
As the first movie of a would-be franchise, the film does a good job sticking to the story at hand and not overloading in mythology, so often the kiss of death of origin stories.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
The film needs to be edited down by at least 20 minutes. It plays like a video game, one unrealistic stunt after another; yet, we aren't invested enough, due to the lack of a cohesive story line.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
Alicia Vikander is securing that franchise money after getting that Oscar gold, and you might enjoy it if you liked the 2013 game.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
The film isn't as interesting as it could be, with a number of plot holes and dialogue weaknesses.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
It's a shame that the rest of the movie isn't nearly up to the spunk that [Alicia] Vikander delivers. It's got some energetic fun, and some sharp action sequences, but too much of the story feels way too familiar.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
This film has more CG effects than the original video game, but you won't get the same gratification.
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
It has its problems, like a climax that does not match its fast-paced approach, but the whole film is a surprising revitalization of a genre that have not been so stimulating in years. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Tomb Raider,52,55,critic,"
Removing its layers of CGI, clichés, hollow dialogues and insubstantial characters, the only thing that prevents this decaffeinated survival from being instantly forgotten is the talent of Alicia Vikander. [Full Review in Spanish]

Breaking In,27,31,audience,"‘Breaking In' Breaks Our Spirit With a Lame, Tame Home-Invasion Debacle"
Breaking In,27,31,audience,"""Breaking in"" is a home invasion thriller that showcases some good acting from Gabriel Union and if you have a couple hours to waste it's ok for that but the film as a whole provides nothing new to the genre. Bad guys want something in the home and the mayhem ensues, overall not really much action basically just going in circles for 2 hours."
Breaking In,27,31,audience,"I found a great invasion film, an excellent script, very good characters, and a great cast."
Breaking In,27,31,audience,"I really enjoyed this. The characters are all believable and well acted. I loved seeing a strong, black, leading woman kick butt all on her own, but Union was too good for this B Grade movie. Can we get a super-hero movie with Union as the lead please? Maybe a Supergirl reprise!! Now that would be something she'd really kick ass in!"
Breaking In,27,31,audience,Breaking In is a disappointing film. It is about a woman who fights to protect her family during a home invasion. Gabrielle Union and Billy Burke give terrible performances. The screenplay is badly written. James McTeigue did a horrible job directing this movie. I was not impressed with this motion picture.
Breaking In,27,31,audience,"Breaking In, the movie's got a very basic plot and it's about this group of criminals who are invading this mother of two's house.

The action sequences are very bland and very cheesy, there's no sort of thrill from them which makes them quite boring.

The direction on which the cast have been put through for this movie isn't great, their characters can feel quite boring, cringy, lifeless and not very memorable at all.

Also, the dialogue from the characters throughout this movie is honestly so cheesy and so cringy, it's so bad.

Overall, it's not a great movie. It's got a very basic plot, bland and cheesy action sequences, characters feel very boring, cringy, lifeless and not very memorable. Also, the dialogue is honestly very cheesy and very cringy, it's not worth the watch."
Breaking In,27,31,audience,This movie was kind of boring.  It was not very exciting.
Breaking In,27,31,audience,"Welp, that escalated quickly, slow start then everything just happens. Early dialogue is clumsily crammed with information instead of doing what film should; show not tell. It's a little cringey even before the MMA-style upkicks the main character uses to subdue an armed and angry ex-soldier. Acting is hit and miss, some characters are painfully subpar compared to others. Interesting concept; enraged mama bear comes back for her cubs, but there are a lot of illogical factors throughout. Me being fat, sad and lonely tonight helps this thing get more than one star. But it wasn't a great experience."
Breaking In,27,31,audience,"Bir anne, evini istila eden hırsızlara karşı çocuklarını ve kendini savunur. Bir sürü örneği olan, klişe bir film."
Breaking In,27,31,audience,"Acting was mediocre. Story was far-fetched and it seemed like the villains were just flat and making all the wrong moves. I was yelling ""Oh come on!"" and ""Why!?!?"" all film.Typical no-risk, cheezy movie.  Not realistic of what would have happened in reality.  No character back story/development. Plot left me scratching my head who the dead dad and invaders were. ""Strong Woman"" is emphasised heavily but the events feel undeniably phoney . Watch Halle Berry in ""Kidnap"" or ""Panic Room"" ,  both 10 times better."
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
There's simply not much that can be said about a film that aims low and still manages to miss its mark.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
Gabrielle Union is so good here. She deserves much better than this movie, and so do audiences.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
A perfect TV movie.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
A solid thriller.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
Breaking In does an ok job of being interesting counter-programming to Infinity War this weekend-it's not bad if you decide to go see it in theaters but you're not missing a lot if you stay home.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
It's the sort of movie that only plays well on HBO at 2 a.m., after roughly 10 wings and 20 beers have been consumed.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
This is a relatively new twist, but whose possibilities McTeigue barely exploits. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
Panic Room knockoff minus all the inventiveness the director of V For Vendetta should have brought to a project like this.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
Unfortunately it ended up being a pretty mediocre film.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
The biggest problem with Breaking In is that you can see a fairly clear path to a much better movie. What could have been a fun upending of expectations turned into a rote checklist of those very same expectations.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
In more adroit hands, such a set-up could yield tense cat-and-mouse thrills, but the twists in Breaking In are all too predictable and so are the characters. Still, Union gives it her best shot as the resourceful heroine.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
Quick, disposable entertainment that leaves you wanting to see Union given a meatier action role.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
Breaking In boorishly fails to break out of norms in the family-in-peril genre and should therefore be left to its own malfunctioning devices.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
This isn't one of the best of the class, but the film delivers what it promises. Think of it as a good bad movie.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
If it wasn't for a studio marketing department thinking maybe it could be pushed as Mother's Day programming, it feels like something that would've gone straight to Redbox.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
All of the makings of a campy good time are [present]. Unfortunately, the movie takes itself too seriously in all the wrong ways to be fun.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
There aren't enough surprises in Breaking In to make it anything more than a passable B-movie.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
The film features one great casting decision and is mercifully only 88 minutes long. Beyond that, I've got nothing.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
So if you thought Breaking In was going to shatter the glass ceiling of genre-based thrillers - (I'm sure many of you assumed it would) - I'm sorry to report: it doesn't.
 "
Breaking In,27,31,critic,"
If you are the kind of person who watches a lot of movies, then Breaking In will feel like a scheme you know by heart.

Hereditary,89,67,audience,"Mother!, The Sixth Sense and The Craft had a baby and its name is Hereditary. Haven't seen s*%# this weird in a while. Loved it. Haunted by it."
Hereditary,89,67,audience,"TÃO BIZARRO QUANTO SEU CRIATIVO ROTEIRO , ATMOSFERA , NARRATIVA , PLOT , CONCLUSÃO E DIRETOR (ARI ASTER) 10/10 
100% DA MINHA APROVAÇÃO!"
Hereditary,89,67,audience,"RATING: A  Director: Ari Aster
Hereditary is a deeply disturbing film about family and a person's death. To say what everyone thinks, Toni Collette was magnificently snubbed at the Academy Awards and the other major Award Shows. I mean that is a performance for the ages, or better said an Acting masterclass ( every acting student should see this film ). Nat Wolff is utterly fantastic as well, but everyone is on point really. For that matter, it's always Astonishing to see an amazing Directorial Debut ( we've got so many nowadays ) but this one from Ari Aster is out of this world. The score is really frightening and menacing. They pulled this amazing unsettling atmosphere through the whole film and you will feel deeply uncomfortable throughout the film and even after the credits are over. I'll never watch it again!"
Hereditary,89,67,audience,"Really enjoyed this film. An amazing dive into grief and family horror. Wonderful performances all round, hats off especially to Toni Collette."
Hereditary,89,67,audience,Brilliantly unsettling. Wonderfully acted. Toni needs an Oscar right now
Hereditary,89,67,audience,"This movie was fantastic, I could watch hereditary 1000 times and not get bored of it, I would recommend this movie for people over 16 and are extremely comfortable with gore and disturbing scenery. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH HIS MOVIE IF THERE ARE KIDS(2-13)IN THE ROOM. overall this movie did not give me nightmares it that's just me, this will probably give you nightmares. The acting awesome in this movie and you will enjoy this movie if you like horror films."
Hereditary,89,67,audience,"Overall good horror movie, but dumb and disappointing ending."
Hereditary,89,67,audience,"Ari Aster's Hereditary is an artful, psychological masterpiece. The storytelling is strong, the cinematography is breathtaking, and the lead actors' performances are haunting."
Hereditary,89,67,audience,One of the scariest movies of the last 20 years.  Magnificent acting and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie will stay with you for days after. This is exactly the kind of horror movie a horror fan looks for.
Hereditary,89,67,audience,"I'm shocked that anyone gave this movie a bad review. It is a masterpiece. Each shot carefully composed. The acting, the story and the overwhelming sense of dread running through this film are remarkable. And when you consider this is from a first time director it's truly a miracle."
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
The film's chilling lesson is timely.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
The open-ended stakes of these genre experiments are rebellious at a time when horror movie messaging can feel so heavy-handed.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
Without a doubt, Hereditary really dug its hooks into me.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
A complete assault on your mind, body, and soul that will leave you feeling battered and broken.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
Part of the fun, if ""fun"" is even the right word for such an upsetting movie, comes from the uncertainty over what kind of horror show this is, exactly.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
Hereditary is a pitch black exploration of family dynamics and the fallout of dark supernatural secrets.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
In the cruel, assured hands of writer-director Ari Aster, Hereditary comes off as an exemplary mood piece.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
Hereditary becomes more and more frightening, submerging the viewers in horror rather than splashing them with occasional waves.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
...if you keep your expectations within reasonable control, you'll be rewarded with a tense and atmospheric-if not all that terrifying-experience...
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
It shouldn't be a huge surprise to see Toni Collette give a great performance. However, the things she does here are unlike anything else that she's ever done in her career.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
Things take a while to get to the occult and bloody, but when they do it's a quite visceral and grim awakening.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
Toni Collette shines in a near horror masterpiece that stumbles in the final act as it ultimately shows its hand.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
I found myself laughing at, not with, Hereditary's hammiest horror moments, culminating in a truly awful ending that spells everything out and yet is still riddled with plot holes big enough to bury a desecrated body in.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
Hereditary doesn't punch viewers in the gut for quite a while, gently poking them instead until the slightest twitch of a finger feels like the cruelest of punchlines.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
This is a film that friends will dare one another to watch and then regret it instantly, and it takes a certain masochistic streak to enjoy.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
The testament of the effectiveness of the story and macabre nature of Hereditary really manifests long after you leave the theater.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
Family drama about loss and tragedy folded into supernatural horror; hints and nods and few overt statements; an exquisite mix of skin-peeling tension, heart-pounding dread, jump scares, and gore. Hereditary left me a broken, gooey mess by the end.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
Not only is Hereditary the slowest of slow burns this side of a Michael Mann film, it is also a near-masterpiece of horror filmmaking.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
Hereditary is a super effective slow burn shocker, a perfect blend of art house sensibilities and transgressive surreal horror that coalesces into a modern classic of the genre.
 "
Hereditary,89,67,critic,"
This was so stupid to me... Absolute, utter nonsense.

Teen Titans GO! to the Movies,91,72,critic,"
Thanks to its giddy sense of humour and wicked wit, this is a surprising leap to the big screen for the Titans that doesn't play it easy, often going out of its way to make the whole audience laugh, regardless of age or familiarity with the characters.
 "

[T]he issue is that with gags so mile-a-minute -- and a pace so blindingly fast -- Teen Titans exhausts even an 84-minute runtime.

Teen Titans Go! To the Movies continues the deconstruction trend of superhero movies - only this time with a target set on the younger audience.

Hits the sweet spot of being broad and goofy enough for the kids to enjoy while containing enough moments of sly with to keep older viewers amused as well.
 "
Teen Titans GO! to the Movies,91,72,critic,"
It was nice to see a 2d animated film and was surprisingly funny
 "
Teen Titans GO! to the Movies,91,72,critic,"
It is unquestionably a kids' movie, full of bright colors and juvenile humor. But it's also a surprisingly smart and self-aware movie, with some meta references and DEEP comic book cuts.
 "
Teen Titans GO! to the Movies,91,72,critic,"
Chock-a-block with vibrant toons, catchy tunes, and jokes aplenty, resulting in one of the more entertaining movies released this year.
 "
Teen Titans GO! to the Movies,91,72,critic,"
While this will be to some people's tastes, I found the film dull and, at points, irritating. Most of the meta-comedy jokes were a little too easy for me to truly find clever, and I probably only chuckled a couple of times.

This summertime surprise took me from zero expectations to maximum fun in less than 84 minutes.

 "
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,audience,"Bridges race relations very well, with a bit of comedy thrown in to have a little fun while we're at it (fighting centuries of systematic oppression through maltreatment, suffering, delusions of white grandiose. Opens up that can of worms for a lot of people, to start getting very real about the way we handle history and our current struggles with race or simply- people who are different from us and our close friends. I'm looking forward to the coming years where there are deeper talks and perspectives around such topics, past the dichotomies of good or bad, black or white, etc; and into those discussions that narrow down everything we carry and have been struggling with individually and collectively. When we can set this falsehoods free inside of ourselves, we can set others free who are around us, no longer carrying our wounds in such hidden ways, acting them out so unconsciously and belligerently. Definitely one to watch. I was almost surprised that my over 65 parents could enjoy this one with me."
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,audience,"Its powerful and thought-provoking, but the third act had some pacing issues that kept me from giving this 5 stars."
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,audience,Love this film both for the plot and acting. Definitely one of Spike Lee's best movies.

BlacKkKlansman,96,83,audience,"Such a well made movie without the typical cringiness that alot of movies like this have. It tells it how it was, and also throws a bit of humour in the mix. The acting is also incredible!"
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,audience,"Great Movie based on true events (from the book of Ron Stallworth), explores the battle of police and underground Ku Klux Klan members in the 1970's. Great performances by John David Washington, Adam Driver and Laura Harrier. Superb work from Director Spike Lee."
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,audience,"I saw this movie thinking it wasn't going to be anything special but I was wrong, I was really surprised, I never thought the film was so good, it is really spectacular, without a doubt one of the best films of that year !!!"

Spike Lee definitely knows how to land a punch.
 "
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,critic,"
Well timed for anniversary of white nationalist march in Charlottesville where activist Heather Heyer was killed, Lee doesn't shy away from linking the past and the present this unsubtly and directly, like no other major American filmmaker.
 "
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,critic,"
Devoted to the politics of race and blood, Lee is obliged to present a version of events largely existing outside actual history. Instead, we are offered history as the record of the beauty or emanation of the race.

Ten years ago, during our optimistic delusions of a post-racial America, we might have naively called such a movie over-the-top. But arriving the same week as an actual white-nationalist rally on the National Mall, it's horrifically spot-on.

BlacKkKlansman is Spike Lee's most significant film since Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X.
 "
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,critic,"
It's frighteningly timely and timeless, yes, but Lee knows how to approach it like a comedy that stands on its middle fingers. Power to the people indeed.
 "
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,critic,"
Lee's joint is undoubtedly a raging inferno of all too relevant social commentary. It's a powerhouse spine-tingler which proactively manages to kick racism in the balls at brute force.
 "
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,critic,"
The film's central concerns - hateful rhetoric dressed up as ""pride,"" prejudiced cops abusing their power - feel viscerally relevant.
 "
BlacKkKlansman,96,83,critic,"
The great revelation of Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman is how imagery can be used as powerful motivators, cultivating the way people feel and act.

BlacKkKlansman is a film with a great cast, but the way director Spike Lee decided to force his message makes the movie feel heavy-handed and oddly redundant in parts.

Long Weekend,73,81,audience,"Life is most definitely funny, a whole lotta crazy, head scratchingly complicated, and all too often unfair. Long Weekend nails all of that and adds an extra little sci-fi twist. I didn't just like watching the movie; I genuinely anticipate watching it again!"

Winsome romcom models resilience; sex, language, drinking.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
An extended exercise in whimsy that lacks the final measure of magic that would put it in the upper echelons of 'impossible' romantic comedies.

Filled with unexpected surprises.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
With strong characters and a twist that meaningfully adds to their story, Long Weekend is an engaging romantic tale that offers a satisfying journey.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
In a genre that often embraces a sense of artifice, Long Weekend feels refreshingly established in genuine dynamics.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
Once the film settles into its more conventionally unconventional story...it just doesn't have the gravitas or plot twists to bear up under the weight of reality. Or unreality.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
I got sucked in. It forced me to like it, and that's one of the best type of movies to see.

Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
Long Weekend remains an easy-going attempt to freshen romcom formula that's best when it relies on the oldest of values, Chao's lively appeal.

Basilone handles it so deftly, including how it defies credibility to be logically true, that we stay with it, and with them, all the way to an ending I found completely satisfying and just right.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
This heartfelt romantic comedy manages enough laughs and emotional depth to avoid conventional genre pitfalls.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
Long Weekend is a fluffy romcom with a strange twist that mostly stands on the likability of its characters. The movie's biggest strength lies in its humanity. That's enough to make it a decent film.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
Feels like a generic indie romance film, one that seemed to be released every week in the '90s and go straight to Blockbuster
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
Subverts expectations in the subtlest of ways, but does so over and over until it eventually evolves into something rare and sweet.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
Long Weekend is mostly undemanding. As long as viewers embrace the film's low-key pleasures, it makes for a passable time filler.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
Wittrock and Chao are undeniably well-cast here, capable of turning pretentious dialogue and an onslaught of niche pop culture references into relatable, human conversation.

Nearly derailed by lovey-dovey irksomeness, but it's rescued by a clever twist.
 "
Long Weekend,73,81,critic,"
Even with a talented and appealing cast, Long Weekend is filled with too many plot holes and cloying moments to be anything but a lightweight and forgettable movie. There's a sci-fi element of the film that's also badly mishandled.

The Father,99,88,audience,Amazing acting by Anthony Hopkins. Academy Award worthy!  Very confusing at times as Im sure the disease is.
The Father,99,88,audience,"i enjoyed the movie, it gives you the other side of memory lost"
The Father,99,88,audience,"This is a 2020 drama film written and directed by Florian Zeller, starring Anthony Hopkins, Olivia Colman, and Imogen Poots. The story follows an aging man who must deal with his progressing memory loss, and the effects of this on his family. It broke me a few different times... This is truly an exceptional film, heartbreaking and very clever in its portrayal of this character's neurodegenerative disease. It is disorienting and very uncomfortable, the way you as the audience member are essentially placed directly into the mind of this character as he experiences these episodes. At times, the film even comes off as a horror film, as uncertainties unfold, and you have no idea if what you're seeing is real. All of this makes for a phenomenal film with a great leading cast to elevate it even higher.

Anthony Hopkins is out of this world incredible in this role. It's not a surprise by any means – it's Anthony Hopkins of course. But seeing just how charming he is one moment, explosive the next, and then downright inconsolable, it is such a treat to see. Olivia Colman who portrays Hopkins' daughter, she is another outstanding addition. You feel every ounce of her unhappiness and confusion. This is a superb film; now that I've been blessed to have seen with my own eyes, I can officially say this film, performers, and the crew all deserve the awards season recognition all are receiving. The Father is in more theaters right now, and will be available On-Demand on March 26. Definitely check this one out!"
The Father,99,88,audience,The conceit of experiencing a story about dementia through the eyes of the person suffering from it is both simple and incredibly effective. The performances are wonderful. A great little piece of cinema.
The Father,99,88,audience,Performance by  Sir Anthony  was   greatly done
The Father,99,88,audience,It was an Excellent and Outstanding film I was Enthralled and wouldn't be surprised if it wins Multiple Oscars

The Father,99,88,audience,"This was a well-acted and thoughtful film. The actors pulled you into the life of an aging man with dementia and the effect it has on his daughter. It was hard to watch and not think about one’s own parents. I suspect there will be Oscar nominations for best actor, supporting actress and best film."

This is a formidable character study, a moving dissertation on aging, and a tightly wound thriller as well.
 "

In a fine ensemble, the most fabulous bit of casting is pairing the grand Olivia Williams opposite Colman in the same movie. I mean, wasn't it just yesterday that we were all getting the two of them mixed up in our own heads? Bellisimo!
 "
The Father,99,88,critic,"
Anthony Hopkins at the peak of his powers...
 "
The Father,99,88,critic,"
The close set and small cast are the ideal building blocks to illustrate the narrowing that so often comes with the end of life, when the world available to us, both physically and socially, grows so small.
 "
The Father,99,88,critic,"
It is Hopkin's performance that really brings it all together. He captures Anthony in a way that feels real, authentic and quite touching.
 "
The Father,99,88,critic,"
It is emotionally draining, and its trajectory is tragically unavoidable, but it deserves our attention and admiration.
 "
The Father,99,88,critic,"
I hope Hopkins, who gives one of the best performances of his career, was able to leave this character behind more easily than I could. Take that as both a wish and the deepest of compliments.
 "
The Father,99,88,critic,"
It is painful and honest and brilliant and smart in its orchestration, and in the work by Hopkins and his supporting cast.
 "
The Father,99,88,critic,"
Watching someone else struggling with a failing memory is a heartbreaking experience, but Hopkins and company make that toil gripping and empathetic. Anthony may not be able to remember what has happened to him, but we will.
 "
The Father,99,88,critic,"
In 'The Father', Hopkins and Colman nurture Oscar-worthy performances in one of the year's very best films.

Pixie,77,56,audience,"Funny and violent comedy-thriller with a great main character. Yes, it's derivative to a fault but has enough of it's own spin to make it worthwhile."
Pixie,77,56,audience,"Olivia Cooke lifts an otherwise bland, copied genre film."
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
The story remains engaging, and it's helped along by a rhythmic screenplay, and three central characters that are impossible to dislike.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
The film feels seriously dated by its '90s-era spin through gruesome violence, spiked with a plethora of characters who can't be bothered to pay much attention to what they're doing.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
Pixie's guarantee: No cliché overlooked.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
With its snappy collision of comedy and violence, this Irish caper has strong echoes of the McDonough brothers as it weaves criminality into everyday life.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
Some gorgeous Irish scenery along with stunning (sometimes violent) plot twists and snappy one-liners (and some gorgeous scenery) make ""Pixie"" a quirky winner, ideal for the weekend while knocking back a Guinness.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
I haven't laughed this hard at some much senseless violence and murder since Fargo.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
A decent, gory Irish comedy. It's like a diet-Martin McDonagh.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
Olivia Cooke is reason enough to watch Pixie. If you've yet to be mesmerized by her acting chops, here's your chance...
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
It's twisty and funny, the plot wrapping around itself without getting lost in its own contrived circumlocutions.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
Olivia Cooke's work here is just about perfect and gives the film a ton of charm even though it's a revenge film.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
Cooke is the driving force propelling the juvenile Irish crime comedy Pixie to success, her transformation into pipsqueak firebrand Pixie O'Brien masterful.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
There is certainly something quite charming about [Pixie] ... But it is a novice whack at a story that could use help in highlighting its subtleties and cleaning its message.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
If this were a normal year, Pixie would be simply referred to as a fun time at the movies.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
Pixie feels as if it arrived via time-warp from about 1998, most likely on a VHS cassette with a 'CLEARANCE' sticker on the slipcase.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
Unless you are either an Olivia Cooke completist or a collector of bad big screen accents, there is nothing of note to see here.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
Too often relegating its title character to the background, this Irish crime thriller seems cobbled together with genre tropes from other Tarantino knockoffs.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
A rather wan take on formulas better handled elsewhere... neither as clever as it thinks nor as engaging as it should be.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
The film is bolstered by the strength of Cooke's magnetic performance and is energetically entertaining, heartbreakingly sad, and darkly humorous.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
Goes beyond homage or aspirational imitation, into the realm of pale, shameless mimicry.
 "
Pixie,77,56,critic,"
Pixie is a movie for fans of crime and action movies who will enjoy the comic elements as a change of pace.
 "
Night of the Kings,99,60,audience,"Night of the Kings is quite memorable, effective and intriguing in its strong first half where the character dynamics and hierarchy were fascinating. The second half introduced flashbacks into the procedure and it was much less interesting to watch. The movie was overly ambitious for such a short runtime, resulting in a daring, but flawed product."
Night of the Kings,99,60,audience,"A terribly executed modern version of One Thousand and One Nights combined with a baffling storyline along with random outbursts of what was supposed to be improvised (yet somehow choreographed?) dancing and singing. The basics were that the main character ""Roman"" was chosen to be the storyteller of the prison and needed to keep his story going until sunrise in order to stay alive. He told the story of Zama King, a gang leader and a friend of his whose fate was met by street justice right before Roman's own admittance to the prison. During his tale telling, he changed the stories often and added a lot of ""mystic"" elements to it that ended up being more confusing than compelling. The entire movie made no sense and there was no climate, unless you count the dance battle towards the end. Many of the critics deemed this movie ""transcendent"" and ""poetic"", when in reality, it was a 90+ minute disappointment that will have you say ""w*f"" at the end."
Night of the Kings,99,60,audience,Just because I feel like giving this movie a 5 star.
Night of the Kings,99,60,audience,"Stylish though it may be, this drama/fantasy about a storytelling ritual carried out in a remote prison ruled by inmates in the Ivory Coast wilderness definitely, definitely, definitely loses something in translation. Director Philippe Lacote's third narrative feature is difficult to follow, largely because much of the material goes unexplained, save for superficial descriptions of the events on screen but with virtually no back story. What's more, it seems assumed that viewers somehow naturally possess an intimate knowledge of African mythology and the political history of the Ivory Coast going in, a rather sizable (and unfounded) presumption on the filmmaker's part, to be sure. The convoluted mixture of drama and fantasy, along with sketchy details about the ritual and the workings of internal prison politics, frequently leaves viewers scratching their heads, wondering about what is really going on. Add to that a host of seemingly impromptu, perfectly choreographed outbursts of song, dance and acrobatics from those listening to the storyteller -- most of which resemble bad experimental theater -- and you've got a confusing tale that ultimately seems indifferently pointless (especially since the narrative of the story being told isn't particularly interesting in the first place). What this production clearly shows is that there's a big difference between creativity and coherent creativity, and, sadly, ""Night of the Kings"" does not reflect the latter."
Night of the Kings,99,60,audience,"A young man, a small-time thief is sent to MACA, a prison in the Ivory Coast that is essentially run by the inmates. The leader of the inmates is close to death, and as part of the legend, he must surrender his rule, and his life, during the red moon. He chooses an inmate (who he calls ""the Roman"" to tell a story, and as the film progresses, we get a sense of how important that story is to the Roman in order to stay alive. This film is very beautifully shot and also very different. I was reminded of many things watching it – Romeo and Juliet with warring factions; the choreography of West Side Story; ""voguing"", break-dancing, and other kinds of dance competition; and the basic horror film standard where, if you can just make it to sunrise, you will be fine. While I am not sure I totally understand the myth underlying the prison power structure, what I did understand, and greatly appreciated, is the power and beauty and importance of storytelling. I loved watching the Roman craft his yarn, which included aspects of magical realism and cultural myth. Through the story, we get an understanding of the social and political environment in the Ivory Coast. The opposing factions in the prison vying to succeed the leader act out various aspects of the story, creating a verbal and visually stunning movement piece. The camerawork and lighting are wonderful and create a world whose beauty comes alive at night. The script is spare but creates tension and suspense that keeps it moving briskly. It is quite a remarkable film and gets a very big thumbs-up from me. The film is on the shortlist for Best International Film this year."
Night of the Kings,99,60,audience,"A gripping story told with fantastic actors, a riveting location, and excellent directing. It involves a prison set in Africa's Ivory Coast, but rather than the usual prison  gratuitous violence, the story focuses on the individuals trapped inside and the culture and rituals they live by. In particular, the story shows the key role of the storyteller to break the monotony of their everyday lives. The film breaks out of the prison setting by portraying the stories told by the storyteller, much the same as the stories help the inmates break out of their confinement... if only for one night."
Night of the Kings,99,60,critic,"
Lacôte occasionally throws in flashbacks and even a fantasy sequence to illustrate the narrative, but the movie barely needs them: the sweat and feeling pouring from Koné's face is more than enough to keep you riveted...
 "
Night of the Kings,99,60,critic,"
A stunning achievement, a folk tale told via poetry, dance and drama, set inside the country's notorious La Maca prison, the ""only prison in the world run by an inmate"".

Coming 2 America,50,43,audience,"This movie is on a par with the 1st part. Its funny, it does stay on the same plot, it is nostalgic with all of the old stars making appearance and it is new in a positive way. Do not try to politicize the narrative. I read so many negative reviews complaining about feminism, racism, black, white... it is ridiculous to pull the movie into this argument. Yes , it will reflect the understanding of its creators. This is normal."
Coming 2 America,50,43,audience,"should've respected the quarantine and stayed at home, in the movie we have the quote, Lavelle said that we didn't need a sequel and he was right."
Coming 2 America,50,43,audience,You get a lot of laughs But from the beginning you can tell what the movie was gonna be about I am the good part for me was all the reminiscent of the original one
Coming 2 America,50,43,audience,"Coming 2 America is a want of time.  This movie is too aware of itself and too full of itself. A shallow script that feels like a project of some celebrity fangirl/fanboy that has worked in writing screenplays maybe once of twice before, and is being forced to write to the ego of the performers instead of the spirit of the characters and the movie. This results in the entire movie feeling forced. As if nearly everything in the movie, including the singers, is a series of paid shorts loosely strung together.  Such a waste of talent. Even worse, a waster of the viewers' time and money. I'll sum it all up with three words.  AVOID THIS MOVIE!"
Coming 2 America,50,43,audience,Such a disappointment..... heartbreakingly bad and we were looking forward to this for some time.  Had to end it early. Couldn't even finish it.
Coming 2 America,50,43,audience,I thought it was teaching a lesson the whole time and not as funny as the first one. They could have spent more time in NYC rather than the palace in Africa. Or have gone out of the palace in Africa to the communities a bit more.
Coming 2 America,50,43,audience,Whats there to say? The cast should have just stayed at home.
Coming 2 America,50,43,audience,"A long time fan of the original (the VHS was one of the few movies we used to watch over and over) I am disappointed. It seems no thought was given to the story itself, which was one of the strengths of the first: travel, adventure, discovery of a new place. The depiction of Zamunda then created an enchanting environment, including loads of its own humor. This humor was now simply copied. The locations of shooting were also far more diverse and interesting in 1988. This movie seems to have been ""pushed out"", produced out of a need instead of creativity.
Yes, it was great to see so many of the original actors. Nevertheless, we turned it off before the end. The stars are for the inclusive aspect and Eddy Murphy's Barbershop types. To me it seems sad that Murphy ♥ came back to the screen for this.
Maybe, hopefully, I am missing the point. 
As for the costumes... The design was impressive, but you could see the clothes were not always well made. The back of a topless outfit was in your face not fitting and at some point, the crown princess is wearing a puma branded dress (a joke?), also, not fitting..."
Coming 2 America,50,43,audience,Huge disappointment. Nice flashbacks but tried too hard to be funny. 
Coming 2 America,50,43,audience,Not as good as the first one
Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
Limp and entirely unambitious, it's a paint-by-numbers exercise that is content simply to go through the motions, existing as little more than nostalgia for nostalgia's sake.

It's not the game-changer that the original was, but you'll have some laughs.

A sloppy round trip from Zamunda to America that comes relentlessly burdened with clichés of all stripes.
 "
Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
Not enough Eddie, and not the Eddie we want. Murphy is just too generous in both these movies: he gives so much screen time away to his co-stars, he himself barely registers, yet he's the reason we're here.
 "
Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
It's lazy, barrel-scraping cinema at its worst.

If you saw the old film there seems to be no reason to see this woeful remake.

Murphy and Brewer's affectionate comedy provides emotional sustenance about family and ethnicity. Coming 2 America is hilarious and sane -- and that goes deeper than pretend pride. Bravo, Eddie Murphy.
 "
Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
A lot of recycled talent adds up to one barely average movie.
 "
Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
The sequel's attempt to modernize the story has a reverse effect: Rather than propel the narrative forward, it neutralizes what made it so impactful at the time, rewriting the past instead of forging the future.
 "
Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
It just lacked the purity and heart of the original -- it's your basic sequel to a 30-year-old movie.

Long live the king of Zamunda -- and a beat you can groove to.
 "
Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
The film flounders, however, when it opts to repeat jokes from the original that are supposedly funny because you'll remember them from last time, particularly with the film's excess of pointless, indulgent cameos.
 "
Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
I have some problems with the story but those nostalgia pieces were really strong. They were chasing a ghost that they were never gonna catch so you gotta appreciate it for what it is.
 "
Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
It had enough laughs for me to say this wasn't a complete waste of two hours. But it didn't have enough to quite justify its existence.
 "
Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
There's nothing for Murphy's naive-princeling act to spark off here - the comic motor of the first film is gone.

I still don't think there is enough good to recommend the film but it's not awful like some other comedy sequels.

Coming 2 America,50,43,critic,"
It's a missed opportunity.

It feels like Coming 2 America was a happening for those lucky enough to be a part of it, and that genuine joy radiates off the screen and continues to endure as the credits roll...

Chaos Walking,22,74,audience,"Daisy Ridley continues her tradition of playing a Mary Sue. Very little character development. Definitely a few woke moments that cause serious eye roles. Predictable plot and twists.

Luckily for Hollywood at this point my expectation for a good film is pretty low. So for the fact that Tom Holland was entertaining, there wasn't an excessive amount of nudity and there wasn't an unnecessary amount of swearing it gets 3 stars from me."
Chaos Walking,22,74,audience,No character development with a two minute story line
Chaos Walking,22,74,audience,"Absolutely terrible. Don't waste your time. Absurd execution, barely would have made it in 2011 as a low category post-apocalyptic movie."
Chaos Walking,22,74,audience,This movie was awesome. Very entertaining with lots of twists and turns. I would highly recommend.
Chaos Walking,22,74,audience,"“We call it the Noise. Happened to all the men when we landed on this planet. Every thought in our heads are on display. It’s fairly harmless, so. Some of us can control it better than others.” At last, we finally got to see Chaos Walking. Based on a book trilogy, the movie takes place in a dystopian world where there are no women and all living creatures can hear each other's thoughts in a stream of images, words, and sounds called Noise. When a woman lands on the planet, a young man must protect her from the remaining men who are hiding a dark secret. Firstly, what an amazing story idea. The main reason I wanted to see this is because of the story and how unique it is to anything we’ve seen before. Originally, Charlie Kaufman was attached to write the screenplay back in 2013, I believe, but was later discontinued to work on the project. That’s very strange seeing as he’s a master of writing and filmmaking. I can tell you everything that he may have wrote wasn’t included. Chaos Walking is an extremely messy movie. Not just because the plot is hard to explain in general, but there is no flow to the story. It kept hinting at something good, but fell short every single chance it had. As a viewer, I had trouble making sense of everything. The way it’s presented is easy to follow, but subplots and ideas are dropped easily. For example, there’s an alien species that’s considered a threat on this planet. It’s talked about and shown for a couple minutes and never talked about again. The dialogue is one of the worst aspects here. It’s just bad dialogue. And with a messy script, it’s hard to direct well enough to make it into something. I’m not a big fan of Doug Liman’s work. He makes best of the situation, but it’s not quite enough. The major problem is what the filmmaking process had to undergo. This was filmed back in 2017 and had plans to be released in 2019. This obviously didn’t work as it underwent heavy reshoots later that summer. When I say heavy reshoots I mean $15 million worth of reshoots. You can see this especially messing with the flow of the story. It feels all too choppy and doesn’t have its footing. This may have also caused side plots to be thrown away or them to come into existence but not get full attention. The acting here is fine. The characters aren’t fully fledged as they could be. Made Mikkelsen plays the antagonist of the story. I get that he’s bad, but I don’t understand what’s motivating him to. Even with the explanation of why, it’s not enough to be convincing. Nick Jonas is heavily miscast here. Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley share most of the screen time. Either something happened on set or this is due to the reshoots, but there is no chemistry here. We’re supposed to believe a romance is starting to bloom, but when it’s show it feels forced. When you think of how they’re only together for a couple days or so it really makes no sense. Another aspect that’s failed due to the writing. I’ve said many negative things so far, but when you don’t think too hard of how the important aspects don’t fully work, it’s not so bad. As a mindless sci-fi thriller I was entertained. Some action scenes are done well. The visual effects work in its favor. The portrayal of Noise is a cool way to think of it. With the scenery, the cinematography is actually really good. If it did one thing, it made me not want to look away. I can’t say I hated Chaos Walking, but I’m definitely disappointed. Not many have actually liked this having received poor reviews from audiences and critics alike. But I can understand if you found it to be something good. It’s definitely entertaining when you don’t focus too hard on the issues. After this long, I wouldn’t say it’s worth the wait. Even the actors and crew attached to the project haven’t even been advertising for it on social media or anything. That has to indicate something. The movie definitely won’t make back it’s budget by a long shot. Even without the pandemic, most were in consensus that it would be a flop. I will reiterate, I don’t hate this. With more work focused on the script, something could’ve been made out of this."
Chaos Walking,22,74,audience,Men have too many thoughts and yet none of the thoughts you're sure they have.

In our current age of preprocessed film spectacle, there is something strangely pleasing-exciting even-about how profoundly unkempt this all feels, especially for a film on this scale.
 "
Chaos Walking,22,74,critic,"
Instead of following the concept to its more logical and interesting extensions, the film seems content to dance around such worthy complications in order to keep things above-board and cutely saccharine.
 "
Chaos Walking,22,74,critic,"
A hot mess that throws a wet blanket of dystopian drivel over fresh young stars Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland. 'Chaos Limping' is more like it.
 "
Chaos Walking,22,74,critic,"
It's visually inventive and thematically suggestive, but the film stubbornly remains a rather cartoonish battle between people who have no textures. At least the superb cast makes us wish it was better than this.
 "
Chaos Walking,22,74,critic,"
Despite Holland's charmingly youthful screen presence... he comes across as an irritating child whose fascination with Viola seems to start and end with the fact that she's a girl. Star Wars' Ridley doesn't fare much better.

There's something worth exploring here, but the story is stuck in the gestating process.

The gawkiness of the male adolescent experience seems to seep into everything, from the coarse chemistry between the two leads to the film's jarring perspective on sound-image relations.

After 30 minutes of this contrivance, it gets so clamorous and tedious, you just wish thought balloons would pop up instead.

Nothing short of a cinematic train wreck -- a wanna-be franchise tent pole that stumbles out of the gate and never recovers.

It's got a major director, a major cast, it's based on a major, award-winning book trilogy, and it's just a major disaster.

As expected, Liman keeps the action moving at a serviceable momentum, but his characters run low on solid emotional connections between each other and us.

Crisis,44,76,audience,Very realistic movie that depicts the high level corruption in big tech companies.
Crisis,44,76,audience,Really great for a movie I thought would suck. I would recommend people to watch this - it's good.
Crisis,44,76,audience,"Excellent movie about much more than opoiod crisis.
It's a lot about how on every evel of society the individual meets with the coldness of the institutions and agencies that surround the modern world, for example the police, who are supposed to work for us. In the movie this is Evangeline Lily's conflict. In the end she manages to take her victim her way and I was glad. Gary Oldman, as a professor is unable to change the world's indifference, but he salvages his own through his integrity. And Armie Hammer, despite, is a great DEA agent. I feel like this is a break out role for him as opposed to his prvious come hither leading man stuff. There should be a sequel. Wish it had gone on longer. Liked itthat much!"
Crisis,44,76,audience,2 out of 5 stars Crisis is one boring thriller drama film. Forgettable performances. Boring plot. The direction is tedious.
Crisis,44,76,audience,"'Crisis' is an uninspired and flawed drama, which despite noble intentions, feels like a light exploration of the opioid ordeal."
Crisis,44,76,audience,"Not as bad as some of the critics say it is. I for one, enjoyed it. The casting was great with decent performances, especially Oldman and Lilly who shined, and the (based on true events) story is certainly not your typical fare. I'm glad it wasn't ""Hollywood-ish"".

Young newb filmmaker Nicholas Jarecki produced, directed, wrote and cast himself in this interesting story that lacked the thrills one would expect from a drama ""thriller"". The intertwining stories had some plot and technical issues and could've been told with better continuity. But they did flow rather well.

His directing was good, but the somewhat slow pacing for the 118 min runtime felt dragged out. Some acts should've been paced faster, and some scenes either cut down or out. And he certainly could've directed some of his cast better. The score was good, but could've used a little more up-beat ""thrilling"" tones. But for a young newb filmmaker wearing that many hats, he did good.

The fact this was based on true events added shock value for the lack of great thrills, and thus made for a good watch. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I watch it again? Probably not. It's a solid 7/10 from me."
Crisis,44,76,audience,"I loved CRISIS. Equal parts thrilling and heartbreaking, Jarecki is in complete control of his craft, with a sick cast at his disposal. Can't wait to see what he does next. Watch this film 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
Crisis,44,76,audience,"Poor imitation of Traffic. Jarecki should have filmed this as a Limited Series rather than fit these three storylines into one disjointed film which he edited down to under two hours. Specially at the end, he could have used more time tying it all together. As it is, there are too many coincidences and he asks us to take too many leaps of faith. Oldman was solid in a role that didn't stretch his abilities. He could have done this in his sleep. Hammer was a miscast (really hard to believe him as an undercover DEA agent with that voice and accent). I am torn between saying he overacted being overbearing while saying he has very limited range as that seemed to be his one emotion. If Oldman was the ""over-qualified"" and Hammer was the ""under-qualified"", I felt Lilly was the ""just right"" actor among the three leads. The role was perfect for her and played to her acting strengths. The supporting cast was strong with newcomers, Kid Cudi and Lily-Rise Depp, holding their own. Greg Kinnear is always a welcome addition."
Crisis,44,76,audience,"I decided to bypass the critical reviews and buy this movie on Amazon prime. I very much enjoyed this film. Great performances from Evangeline Lilly and Gary Oldman and an interesting look from all angles of the opioid epidemic. Very similar to traffic but not quite as good content wise, but still recommend and enjoyed. Makes you wonder if the Armie Hammer stuff affected the reviews. While not a perfect movie it’s also significantly better than 40%"
Crisis,44,76,audience,Really enjoyed this movie about the opioid crisis. If you like thrillers or intense drama then it's a must watch. Very educational about the crisis we face in America related to pharmaceutical drugs.
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
There's the sort of material here that used to form the basis for an entire series of The Shield, so... it's difficult for anything to be dwelt on in detail although the high calibre acting and decent pace mean it's never less than watchable.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
There is lot of misdirection which is confusing and you might not want to stick with it. But if you do, the convergence of the plot lines mostly works.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
It's well-acted and timely but writer/director Jarecki's opioid drama is less affecting than the headlines that inspired it.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
""Crisis,"" the thoughtful film directed and written by Nicholas Jarecki, is definitely worth your consideration.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
A fractured tale that follow three stories that have been touched by the opioid crisis. Not without its flaws, but an engaging tale that builds a tense atmosphere.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
[Nicholas] Jarecki's latest movie lacks both dramatic urgency and above all, emotional poignancy to make us root for the characters.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
'Crisis' is not a great film even absent Hammer's pall, but it is also a worthwhile one despite it.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
A lot of acting fire power and too many storylines keep an idea that suits the moment from being more powerful.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
...good intentions don't automatically make for good movies.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
The film's narrative and characters reason that any difficult situation can be solved with blind brute force and a pistol. If you're looking for a cutting critique of the American addiction industry, look elsewhere.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
Jarecki takes a ""Crash""-like approach to the opioid impact, which lends an ill-fitting, hyperbolic edge to the important issue and its numerous facets.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
It's a little too all over the place, with a few too many movies trying to be contained in this to be able to come together and make sense.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
The movie becomes so enamored with showing enmeshed storylines of the three main characters that it all just becomes a tangled mess that tries to tie up loose ends neatly in a very unrealistic way, in order to have a cliché movie ending.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
Oldman and Lilly shine in this crime thriller, but it's the humanity and less obvious situations that are the most captivating of all.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
For the most part, Jarecki keeps all the plates spinning in this multi-story Traffic-like tale of the ravages of opioids.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
It puts a face on the opioid crisis.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
Crisis' flaws ultimately outweigh its attributes.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
A slow burn thriller about America's opioid epidemic. Though marred by an unspectacular final act, and impacted in the media by star Armie Hammer's involvement, it's still a solid exploration of the subject matter.
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
These three stories don't so much intersect as they do bump into each other sloppily...
 "
Crisis,44,76,critic,"
We need well-researched introductions to the topic's nuts and bolts as much as dramas amplifying its human cost. Just don't expect this to be both.

Safety,80,78,audience,"it's no Brink, but not bad for a DCOM"
Safety,80,78,audience,"One movie I have recently watched is Safety on Disney Plus. This Disney original follows the true story of a Clemson football player, Ray ""Ray Ray"" McElrathbey who assumes the responsibility of taking care of his much younger brother, Fahmarr McElrathbey, after their mother is forced into rehab. The movie is quite Disney, and oddly enough reminds me a little bit of the Disney Chanel Original trilogy High School Musical. Heartwarming, emotional, and awesome are words that can only scratch the surface of all that this movie is. The story line is much like a roller coaster at the duo seems to always float in and out of being on top of the game and in trouble with administration. In the end though, it is quite nice to see how everyone was able to come together in their support, especially knowing that the movie is based on a true story. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a heartwarming story but also does not mind the cringe."
Safety,80,78,audience,I really liked it! definitely recommend watching:)
Safety,80,78,audience,"'Safety' - very good!

Disney enters the sports drama market for what feels like the billionth time, though in fairness they usually nail it - and do the same with this. They've done many better, e.g. 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' and 'Glory Road', but I very much felt entertained by this.

The cinematography is, truly, excellent - credit to Shane Hurlbut. I also took note of the editing (Terel Gibson), which is particularly neat at the beginning. The plot is compelling and features a lot of heart, it certainly uses the usual Disney/sports biopic beats but there's a lot of goodness in there as well. On this note, it has a decision scene where I half expected Chuck Norris to appear. Iykyk.

I enjoyed the cast. Jay Reeves gives a terrific performance as Ray, while Thaddeus J. Mixson is more than solid as brother Fahmarr. Corinne Foxx (daughter of Jamie), James Badge Dale and, despite only a short appearance, Amanda Warren are also good. Cool, for me anyway, to see 'The Walking Dead' alum IronE Singleton involved.

I'd recommend this, for sure."
Safety,80,78,audience,"I'd give this a recommendation, but barely. It's not a football movie to me, per se. One knock on it is that it was too long. It was inspiring though, and had its funny moments. Some scenes brought me back a little to what college football was like before the pandemic, and I liked that about it."
Safety,80,78,audience,"Safety is based on an interesting true story, but it's done by filmmakers who didn't quite tell it right. This movie rambles on a little too long at times (it clocks in at over two hours) and it glosses over other plot points that could have been interesting. This Disney film plays it safe and sticks to the tried and true inspirational sports movie formula. It's a movie the whole family can watch (and eventually forget) together."
Safety,80,78,audience,"This doesn't do many things that are new in the genre and the romantic subplot feels kind of pointless. That being said, there's a lot to like here. It's filled with tons of emotion and delivers many heartwarming scenes and uplifting moments."
Safety,80,78,audience,"Uplifting and inspiring, Safety doesn't quite do much new with the inspirational sports movie genre, but its compelling, fact-based story and performances by its leads will likely have fans of the genre cheering!"
Safety,80,78,audience,"This movie has all the feels. Great story of what hard work, family, and community can accomplish!!!"
Safety,80,78,audience,"This was a very inspiring story. I am happy someone took the time to create a movie about this amazing story because in some way, we can all learn from it. It shows some truths of life, and what some people are willing to do to save someone else. Although some parts were confusing and the football cliques were pretty bad and predictable, it was still a very touching movie."
Safety,80,78,critic,"
Much of this might appear on the surface as being contrived, but it feels nothing but sincere as it connects us to not only Ray Ray and Fahmarr but every coach and athlete we meet.
 "
Safety,80,78,critic,"
One of the better sports films to be released in some time.

Safety is an inspiring story that proves there is more to athletes and sports programs than the sport itself.
 "
Safety,80,78,critic,"
Emotional, intense, inspiring true tale of family, teamwork.
 "
Safety,80,78,critic,"
While the true story of McElrathbey is an inspiring one, the movie it spawned phones in drama most mild, more interested in making his story seem less questioning and more heartfelt.
 "
Safety,80,78,critic,"
Very 'Hollywood'; very slick but well done and a good story to tell.
 "
Safety,80,78,critic,"
Even if you're not particularly fond of sports movies, at the core of this movie is a story about family and persevering against all odds. You will laugh, you will cry but I can guarantee you will be walking away with a big smile on your face.

Sometimes, it doesn't matter if you know your buttons are being pushed, so long as they're pushed well. Safety pushes them well enough.

Sacrifice is selfless and it h ave never been more resilient than in the life of Ray-Ray McElrathbey in Safety on Disney Plus. Emotionally poignant and inspirational.
 "
Safety,80,78,critic,"
The well-acted film carries a heartfelt message, although the script is too sanitized and commercialized for its darker underlying themes to carry the desired emotional impact.

The film that exists may fill in some temporary vacuum in a season without capacity-level crowds on Saturday nights and evenings. But those who want something more may have to wait a little longer.

Even with its clear weaknesses, Safety is an uplifting film about the unbreakable bonds in communities and teams, and between brothers.

This fact-based Disney+ movie presents a story that's stirring enough to predictably eke across the goal line as an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser, even if it's playing on a venue without crowds.

The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,audience,"This is one of the most moving films I have ever seen. The resilience, strength and valor that the great Billie Holiday possessed is that of a champion. America tried to run her name through the mud but she was too powerful, too well known and adored. Andra Day gives the performance of a lifetime! That Oscar is hers."
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,audience,"This is singer Andra Day's first major role! It is a Tour-de-Force from beginning to end as far as she's concerned. It's aN average pseudo-biopic, but Day's performance is undeniable. She's now nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role, I'll be surprised if she doesn't secure a win. Epic performance."
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,audience,5/5 Stars! Andra Day is glorious!
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,audience,"Absolutely obsessed with Andra Day's performance as the titular Billie Holiday! A historical figure who's gotten a bad rap as a junkie with a great voice. Drugs overshadowed her legacy but there was something far more insidious at work. The US government hounded this brilliant women for singing one of perhaps the very first protests songs. How fitting that Andra Day, who's own song ‘Rise Up' is an unofficial anthem of the BLACK LIVES MATTER movement is now nominated for Best Actress as the Oscars, coming of the heels of her Golden Globe win! Watch this film for the message, for Andra Day's brilliant and transformative work and for the gorgeous & heartbreaking music that Billie Holiday put her life on the line for, clearly half the critics got it wrong this time!"
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,audience,"This is also a GREAT film, it's not perfect but never boring and Andra Day truly is stunning! Lee Daniels chaotic direction oddly worked, I don't understand people's hang ups with his films. He's one of the best Directors when it comes to drawing performances out from unlikely actors. Andra Day will be walking up to accept her Academy Award in April 25th."
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,audience,"Newly minted Oscar nominee Andra Day, is the real deal folks! Deserved nomination and hopefully win."
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,audience,I can't believe Rotten Tomatoes only gave this movie a 53%. This was a great movie! It didn't even seem like a documentary because it showed a different aspect of Billie a Holidays story as far as her trouble with the law and men. Character particularly black characters have been watered down in these types of roles but this was not. And the music was great.
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,audience,I just couldn't finish it. Great leading lady. Great soundtrack. Horrible script. Don't bother. You'll be very disappointed.

Andra Day is mesmerizing in the lead role. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie around her is as inelegant as it is unfocused, a soapy, cheaply produced melodrama.

As an actress, Day mostly smolders -- not inappropriately, given the script -- but as a vocalist she runs the gamut from playful to anguished as she performs the Holiday songbook... If only the rest of ""Billie Holiday"" could have lived up to her.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
Andra Day is a singer who is appearing as an actress for the first time in this movie, and her performance as Holiday is amazing.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
If Daniels's purpose was to recreate the cruelty and ingratitude of Holiday's treatment, he has succeeded: this film doesn't deserve her.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
The movie is a mess but her performance is excellent
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
The headline is certainly her performance
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
Andra Day is amazing, and she is far and away the best part of this movie.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
It all hangs on Andra Day's performance. She's fantastic in this movie.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
I think overall there were some moving moments, but the execution kind of left something to be desired... I always judge a film by whether or not I'd watch again - and for me? Once was enough.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
It feels like I'm watching trauma porn with one hell of a soundtrack.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
The biggest flaw of The United States vs. Billie Holiday, besides its commitment to substituting shocking violence for character development, is that it cannot decide how its leading lady sees herself.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
The United States vs. Billie Holiday can't quite reach the heights achieved by the soaring voice of its star. But even with the film's many issues, that phenomenal central performance makes it a movie experience worth having.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
While the film features a powerful performance by singer-songwriter Andra Day, the narrative as a whole is unfortunately not supportive of its absorbing authenticity and marvelous musicality. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
It's disappointing when we think how fluid, resonant and evocative this biopic could have been if appropriately and honestly built.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
...ultimately a messy, confused chronicle of the star's traumas, career struggles and relationship dramas.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
A disappointing biopic...
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
Like so many biopics that have come before, The United States vs Billie Holiday can't quite crack how to tell Holiday's story effectively.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
Billie deserves a better telling of her story.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
Holiday and Day deserve a bigger canvas, one that has space to paint a soul of a woman whom no one got.
 "
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,52,88,critic,"
Esteemed playwright Suzan-Lori Parks is credited as scenarist. Yet at times you may wonder if there was a script at all, as the film lurches from often blunt, preachy setpieces to yet another space-filling montage.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,audience,"Midsommar but wrong. 

The producers saw an opportunity of making a (wrong) turn to the whole cult stuff, with a weak script, mediocre performances, and not enough gore nor chills to live up to the original Wrong Turn."
Wrong Turn,64,46,audience,"Smarty written, well acted and great chilling moments . But one big problem: The end of the movie. Grade: C+"
Wrong Turn,64,46,audience,Let this movie marinade gets gets better as it goes on. 
Wrong Turn,64,46,audience,"""Woke"" America is destroying our culture
Absolutely irredeemable"
Wrong Turn,64,46,audience,"3.5/5.  Though it doesn't really feel like a Wrong Turn movie, this reboot is a decent enough horror film with some disturbing twists and turns."
Wrong Turn,64,46,audience,Humiliating for anyone associated - at least it should be
Wrong Turn,64,46,audience,"I had very little expectations from the movie, but it did exceed them. Of course it is not at par with great horror movies, but it keeps you engaged, unlike the first Wrong Turn (2003). You will not regret watching this."
Wrong Turn,64,46,audience,Very good movie. I enjoy myself
Wrong Turn,64,46,audience,The worst reboot/sequel/remake of all time. Don't watch this stupid movie
Wrong Turn,64,46,audience,"Not horrible, not good. Highly unrealistic and quite cheesy. Good gore and decent acting, but this is not a quality horror movie by any means. It's actually kind of stupid. It just meets the point of being worth a watch, but if you know anything about horror movies, you should know that wrong turn 1, and maybe 2, are by far the best. All the rest are mostly garbage, but... This wrong turn is better than most complete garbage that is out there these days. Enjoy! "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Campers in trouble Part 86 gives way to a curiously current portrait of a country divided and a loving father surprisingly good with an ax.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
At nearly two hours long, this film is by far the longest film in the franchise, and it overstays its welcome at the 70-minute mark, with the entire third act focusing on the father character looking for his daughter.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
A surprisingly ambitious franchise entry that delivers arguably 3 films in 1 (sometimes to its own detriment). When the film aims for political commentary, it falls flat, but the set-pieces, the practical effects and that final sequence are gold.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
These backwoods adventures have grown tired and Wrong Turn doesn't breathe any necessary new life into the genre.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Wrong Turn effectively breathes new life into the familiar horror franchise while still making viewers wary of going into the woods.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Efficient and enjoyable. A couple of horrifying and haunting moments. The whole thing doesn't make any sense at all, and it scores zero points for originality, but it has a really haunting final shot and it does exactly what it set it to do.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
There is a lot of movie crammed into Wrong Turn's 110-minute(!) runtime. Some of it doesn't work, but most of it works just enough to merit a recommendation.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Director Mike P. Nelson creates a handsome look and generates alternate surprise and suspense by springing things on characters and showing us traps they haven't noticed.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
The first half of the film is entertaining, but when the overall mythology of the film is revealed, it bogs down and sinks under the weight of being too ambitious for its own good.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Wrong Turn has its issues, but it's entertaining and a fun watch if you like a brutal backwoods film with a bit more to it than just kills and blood.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
An effective movie, well done, and taken down a different path.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Although it's admittedly beholden to clichés, 'Wrong Turn' keeps from falling into enough narrative traps to arrive at an exciting destination that clutches you by the throat.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Wrong Turn has some decent booby-trap business but can't find enough that is different to enliven the weary concept. But for the horror hardcore, keep watching once the credits roll.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
I kinda hated this movie, but nonetheless appreciate that it's quite bonkers enough to perhaps someday become a kind of camp classic. If you must...
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
This is a good horror film, a worthy Friday night fright, and a considerable improvement on what's gone before.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Hardly a good movie, but it's better than the dreadful 2003 one, and boasts craftsmanship and acting superior to what one usually finds in these 'Chainsaw' derivatives.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Wrong Turn ends up being connected to the franchise in name only and you're left wondering what the point of it all was.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Wrong Turn illustrates how often those who want to create their own new, separate society from the rest of the world wind up creating a more barbaric state of being.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
Just because the film takes itself too seriously doesn't mean a viewer has to.
 "
Wrong Turn,64,46,critic,"
[A] surprisingly good reboot of the not-very auspicious 2003 cannibal-themed slasher of the same name (despite its forgettability, the original did, apparently, give rise to five sequels).

Silk Road,55,40,audience,Neutral ending was great for this movie.
Silk Road,55,40,audience,Worth watching excellent movie
Silk Road,55,40,audience,"Silk Road is a complete mess of a film. Nick Robinson tries his best, but seems to be miscast. Jason Clarke on the other hand seems to be sleepwalking in his role. The story behind this film is an interesting one. But it’s told in the most bland and least compelling way. The characters come off as extremely unlikeable. One thinks he’s better than everyone else and the other is a corrupt DEA agent who continuously neglects his family for his job. The writing is also terrible, and the direction isn’t much better. The film has these weird freeze frame shots throughout the film that are just awkward. The dialogue is eye roll inducing, and the film just talks down to the audience like they are better than us. Overall, this had potential but it just failed. Compelling ideas can’t make up for amateurish direction, a weak script, and lackluster performances. "
Silk Road,55,40,audience,"I live in Austin and followed this story a bit when it happened and was excited to see the movie. I thought it played more like a cops and robbers movie like Bullitt or The French Connection but instead of chasing the bad guys in a Mustang GTO on the mean streets of San Fran, this movie has them chased through the dark web of Silicon Valley. That may not sound as sexy but the filmmakers do a good job of making Jason Clarke's character into a Steve McQueen type who has been stuck on desk-duty but can apply the same tactics to nerds on computers that he did to criminals on the streets. After watching, I questioned whether Jason Clarke's character was fabricated because the hard-nosed, morally-compromised cop seemed a bit contrived in a movie about technology. But if you look it up, he is based on real cops involved with the case and this made me give it an extra star. I paid a couple extra bucks to buy it and Ill watch it again in a couple months to see how it holds up."
Silk Road,55,40,audience,Your review will help others decide whether to watch.
Silk Road,55,40,audience,2 out of 5 stars. Silk Road is a boring crime drama film with a boring story. Tedious direction. Eh cast ensemble. It was difficult to care for the film.
Silk Road,55,40,audience,Not worth it AT ALL. This could have been way better. Nick Robinson..... come on
Silk Road,55,40,audience,"This was a great flick especially during the pandemic void of blockbusters.  My wife and I generally hit the movies for a date night once or twice a month, and usually look for blockbusters/marvel movies etc.  With the theaters barely opening and no major films being released, there's not much playing.  Especially with the recent GameStop/AMC stock market and Elon buying 1.5 Million in Bit Coin events in the news, I really liked this movie.  Although I had heard of Silk Road and bit coin when it call came to a head in the news, I didn't realize how little I knew about what actually happened.  I really thought they did a good job with the two main characters - one of which was a recognizable actor that added legitimacy to the movie.  I thought it was very well done, and interesting.   I didn't have high expectations, was glad just to get a date night, but thoroughly felt like I watched a worthwhile movie and this would have been worth watching during normal times (just in between Marvel blockbusters...)."
Silk Road,55,40,audience,"Being fairly well versed in this fascinating story, this movie was definitely a disappointment overall. I think the main problem is a simple one. There is too much story to cram into a 2-hour movie. This would be excellent as a miniseries or a limited series show on cable. Kind of like what Netflix did with The Queen's Gambit. Or HBO did with Chernobyl. A 5 to 8 episode series. Then you'd have yourself the potential for a great show! This movie jumped all over and enormous chunks were left out and/or changed. I'd recommended the book ""American Kingpin"" if you want the full story. There's also a good documentary on YouTube called ""The Dark Side Of the Silk Road""."
Silk Road,55,40,audience,Was shocked to see my hometown had such a role. Wondering why we didn’t hear more about this at the time.
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Perhaps millennials have taken the excitement out of organised crime. You won't find much in this movie.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Cybercrime is hard to make sexy but Silk Road manages to fashion a largely gripping story, even if it fails to deliver a weighty or insightful look at the crook at its heart.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Above average movie about the Dark Web. Jason Clarke excels in his performance as usual.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Drama about dark-web marketplace has drugs, language.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Got the right story but the wrong filmmaker to do it.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Dismiss Silk Road as ""The Social Network for stoners"" at your own peril. My eyes were plenty red by the end of this movie, but it had nothing to do with drugs.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
This remains an interesting tale that hopefully will one day have a better movie made about it.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Silk Road is not without its pleasures - Clarke especially is fun to watch as he gets increasingly cornered with his shakedown shenanigans - just don't expect the kush; this is strictly schwag.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Silk Road squanders this moment - and this complex, stranger-than-fiction story - to bring us a talented cast walking through a lazy script.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
""Silk Road"" manages to tell a compelling story thanks to the two leads.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
There is a wealth of confirmation to be found about many our worst nightmares in this cautionary tale of stereotypes, specialization, and the consequences of absolute freedom.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Yes, this is going to be two hours of listening to the philosophizing of a libertarian edgelord whose actions on those beliefs landed him in the slammer for life.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
With much promise but no delivery, ""Silk Road"" never gets high on its own supply. Instead it may just rank with those recent, terrible adaptations of Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"" as examples of libertarians making subjects for bad movies.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
This is a smart movie about smart people doing some not-smart things and facing the consequences that keeps us absorbed.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Silk Road tells two versions of the same story: two men willing to sacrifice everything to win.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Blending fact with fiction, Tiller Russell's take on Austin kingpin Ross Ulbricht benefits from strong performances by Jason Clarke and Nick Robinson
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
The Social Network redrawn in weed and wispy start-up beards.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
What's missing is any thoughtful examination of why [Silk Road founder Ross] Ulbricht would do all this, other than some self-serving narration about personal liberty that sounds like the most boring manifesto ever.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
Jason Clarke knocks it out of the park in the kind of role he was born to play - that of the troubled, streetwise DEA agent Rick Bowden.
 "
Silk Road,55,40,critic,"
I can't say that familiarity bred much by way of contempt, maybe because the movie hits enough genre marks to prove modestly engaging.

I Care a Lot,80,36,audience,This movie is all kinds of messed up and everyone is horrible...and that's the point. This is how you subvert expectations. I loved it. I just wish they'd committed to that until the end instead of copping out and tacking on the last minute or two for the audience. Lost a star for that. Otherwise perfect.
I Care a Lot,80,36,audience,It went from CREDIBLE to FANTASTICAL to UNEXPECTED to FORMULAIC. Disappointed in the last half hour. 
I Care a Lot,80,36,audience,Worst movie ever. Too many things wrong to count and list. Dinklage's character should have cut of her limbs and tongue and put her in a home. Lead character is stupid and infuriating.  This movie should be considered a hate crime.
I Care a Lot,80,36,audience,Worst...bloody...movie of 2021. The script had potential. The cast was perfectly suited. But it completely and utterly bombed. What a waste of my time. Whoever is responsible for this atrocity should be ashamed.
I Care a Lot,80,36,audience,"Lessons learned:

1. It's OK to do WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO to get what you want.
2. It's OK to scam elderly people.
3. Indoor cycling promotes healthy breathing and allows you not to die after who knows how many minutes under ice-cold water.
4. It's all about the money.
5. Men get potentially infuriated/ashamed when women win.
6. Karma is a bitch.

*Rosamund Pike should win the ""Most Annoying Character of the year"" award. 
*Glad to see Eiza González raising the bar on her acting."
I Care a Lot,80,36,audience,"The most annoying movie ever and silly , even porn is better than this acting."
I Care a Lot,80,36,audience,good unpredictable thriller but a little hard to care about (no pun intended) since the main characters were so evil...
I Care a Lot,80,36,audience,"I CARE A LOT doesn't care enough for a protagonist. It's the script's fault that it gives you no one to cheer for though-out the story. All these characters are mean and are really unlikable. So when one wins, we feel nothing as the audience. Although, the ending did leave me feeling satisfied and it was indeed well shot."
I Care a Lot,80,36,audience,1h 58m of frustration ... avoid this movie ...
I Care a Lot,80,36,audience,guess who didn't care

I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
The highlight is Dinklage as the gangster.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
Rosamund Pike is sensational in this dark and twisted comedy/thriller about the lengths some people go to gain power and money in this capitalist world. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
This is not an ""important"" film and it gives the viewer absolutely no one to love or root for, but if your threshold for nihilism is high, you might enjoy it ""a lot.""
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
I kept thinking how the novelty of this film wasn't just in the dreamy, techno-scored montages or Rosamund Pike's preternaturally perfect hair, but in how this movie takes what amounts to a horror story and tells it from the point of view of the villain.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
...the story keeps contracting with fatuous exaggeration and expanding with some thrilling action.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
""I Care a Lot"" is a sharp takedown of our warped system of elder care.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
Ultimately, while some of its plot points may not entirely work, I Care a Lot is still likely to hold your attention for its two hours running time and impress you with the acting skills of its wonderful cast.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
This contest of wicked wills is a vibrant, penetrating Pandora's Box of predicaments and likeable yet evil central characters, played with satirical skill by Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
...the whole thing goes off the rails, turning into a high-concept action film that seems badly grafted onto the initial premise. But the performances, including one by Chris Messina as a shark lawyer, make it all eminently watchable.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
The finale is a head scratcher... and you're left thinking about individual moments and performances rather than the whole; those separate pieces are great, but the net result is just fine
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
The film becomes more crime caper than character study. This evolution requires several narrative contrivances, and the film has to write itself out of a corner repeatedly... Still, I was invested in the story, even as it got increasingly ridiculous.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
Pike's steely demeanor and icy glares and crisp movements bring to life a character whose evil is so mundane and so believable that it inspires genuine revulsion.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
It tries to be a message movie, and I'm not sure what the message was.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
Yes, I'm exaggerating but you get my drift. On the other hand, if this sounds like your cup of (poisonous) tea, go for it...
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
Rosamund Pike thrives here, and I Care a Lot manages to surprise at almost every turn.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
There is a genuinely great movie that will likely be made one day about this type of fraud with human lives as commodity, and when someone makes it, I'll be sure to let you know.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
Whilst it would have been nice to see the story structure tightened up a bit here, Pike and Weist make it worth watching.
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
A few plot flaws along the way but man that Rosamund Pike can act. Hated her - her character I mean!
 "
I Care a Lot,80,36,critic,"
There's a certain amoral vim and verve to the proceedings that is at once horrifying and thrilling, allowing us to revel in the characters' evil while also recoiling from their monstrous deeds.

The Sinners,53,42,audience,"Incoherent, clichéd, and terrible"
The Sinners,53,42,audience,‘The Sinners' Blends Teen Slasher With Crime Thriller to Messy Results
The Sinners,53,42,audience,I mean it wasn't all bad; like unwatchable bad. There were some moments worth seeing but was it worth watching the whole movie; absolutely not. But I've seen worse movies.
The Sinners,53,42,audience,"Well shot and cast, but poorly executed.

This is actress turned newb filmmaker Courtney Paige's first full length feature film (one prior short) as co-writer, producer, actor and director. For a newb filmmaker, she did well in every aspect except the writing - which blame also falls to her two other writers.

The story was cliched, clumsy and a convoluted mess riddled with plot and technical issues. The editing felt like it was put thru a shredder, then taped together quickly. It was confusing more than entertaining. Had the writers consulted a seasoned writer to fix up their screenplay, this could've been a hit, because all other filmmaking aspects were on point. Her directing was decent, considering she followed her own convoluted screenplay. Scores in B-films are usually loud, annoying, overbearing and unfitting, but this film's was actually great with some decent soundtracks. The cinematography was good, and the casting and performances were very impressive. Even the pacing was perfect for the comfortable 96 min runtime. As a new filmmaker, Paige certainly has a future ahead of her. I just wish out of the 3 writers, at least one of them would've got it right. Nevertheless, a decent watch if nothing better is on for her targeted audience of teens-tweens."
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
Paige's debut might resonate with a younger audience, but it otherwise unravels at the slightest tug of its plot threads. It prefers to tell over show; expect major plot beats to unveil through lengthy exposition dumps that still don't bring clarity.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
Director and co-writer Courtney Paige does her best to spin all of this into a high school thriller à la Agatha Christie, however the overall experience of watching The Sinners is disjointed and tedious.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
The Sinners is a deeply layered and nuanced film that finds as much strength in what is not discussed as in what is.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
The Sinners is a bit rough around the edges, slightly unfocused, and too densely plotted at times but there's plenty of style and slickness to it also and the performances each herald major stars on the rise.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
The Sinners commits the cardinal cinematic sin of not grabbing the audience's attention.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
We can respect its ambition and its visual artistry, but its unevenness is a drawback.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
The Sinners has other things to offer aside the Jawbreaker-like plot. For starters, the great cinematography by Stirling Bancroft; as well as, the work of composer Holly Amber Church whose atmospheric score complements the film quite well.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
[It's] definitely not a horror classic on the level of director David Fincher's 1995 film Seven, another macabre thriller with the seven deadly sins as its theme. As far as slasher films go, The Sinners can be considered slightly better than most.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
Loosely playing with themes of piousness and intolerance, this horror-thriller is so busy and cluttered that it becomes more of a confusing slog than anything either entertaining or biting.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
Not good, no purpose, cliched, so I bailed early.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
With so much story to tell and so many characters to root for (or against), we could use a deep dive into the risks of unchecked misogyny.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
In The Sinners, the feature film debut of director and co-writer Courtney Paige, sin and religion clumsily hold together a story with not much to say.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
At least The Sinners' sexy-schoolgirl-corpse aesthetic - part Twin Peaks, part Ariana Grande music video - is too ineptly executed to truly offend.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
'The Sinners' talks the talk but can't walk the walk of being another 'Riverdale' imitator with its own unique spin on small-town criminality.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
The Sinners plays the part so well that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was just more of the usual, but this is Courtney Paige's film, and she's taking it somewhere very different.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
A film which aesthetically and emotionally aligns with The Craft, The Sinners offers a surprising hybrid of teen slasher and crime thriller.
 "
The Sinners,53,42,critic,"
this dreamily shot, softly lit story of adolescent angst finds itself switching between the different registers of Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides (1999), Andrew Fleming's The Craft (1996) and David Fincher's Se7en (1995).
 "
Blithe Spirit,28,41,audience,"I mostly enjoyed the movie up until the revised ending. It seemed a little Mean Girl Getting Back at the Bad Guy.  As a ""fresh new Feminist Take"" it rather Flopped."
Blithe Spirit,28,41,audience,"This was a silly, zanny comedy and I enjoyed it for what it was.  This movie had scenes that were almost sexy, yet still silly... in Body Mind and Spirit! It was very well written and while some of the plot was predictable, it was still a funny movie. 
**  NOT for Children.
8 of 10."
Blithe Spirit,28,41,audience,"One of the worst movies since Rotten Tomatoes was played.  Slap stick,  and not entertaining"
Blithe Spirit,28,41,audience,The third act was a huge disappointment. 
Blithe Spirit,28,41,audience,"No good obnoxious and annoying to watch, everyones trying to be too funny and campy but it just cones off as loud "
Blithe Spirit,28,41,audience,"My husband & I were not familiar with the stage play and the 1945 movie.  Needless to say, we didn't know what to expect.  
We thought the movie a little goofy but entertaining.  We thought Leslie Mann did a great job with her role.  Judi Dench, as always, did a very good job as well.  For the most part, everyone did a good job with their roles.
We don't know how this would compare to the stage play & the older movie, but we enjoyed ourselves getting entertained and having a good laugh."
Blithe Spirit,28,41,audience,"Blithe Spirit wastes a talented cast on a bad script. Dan Stevens, Isla Fisher, Leslie Mann, and Judi Dench were all great and definitely made a strong effort with their performances. The production and costume design were also pretty solid. The film tries to harken back to old school screwball comedies and it doesn’t work. The film just isn’t funny, and feels way longer than the 99 minutes it actually. I did appreciate the ending though. It tries to take things in a different direction, and while it isn’t wholly successful due to certain unlikeable characters, I do applaud the ambition. Overall, this wasn’t a successful remake. I haven’t seen the original, but I assume it’s better. I wish the script was as good as the cast was. "
Blithe Spirit,28,41,audience,The acting was good but there was no substance.  It could have been so much better. It came to an abrupt and predictable ending. There were a few brief short laughs but nothing consistent.
Blithe Spirit,28,41,audience,"Hilarious Noel Coward's play brought to the screen and Judi Dench stole the film as the spiritualist medium who brought back the ex-wife of a writer suffering from writer's block in a seance, thus chaos ensues with his present wife."
Blithe Spirit,28,41,audience,"Edward Hall's Blithe Spirit is a terrible movie adaptation of an otherwise classic play created by Nöel Coward, the legendary English playwright. I was bored out of my mind within the first hour, and felt horrible for how underused Leslie Mann and Isla Fisher were. Do yourself a favor and skip this one altogether."

No matter the medium, the raconteur's sharp dialogue often amuses. Too bad that the overall effect, in this movie, drops precipitously in time.

This will work for anyone who pays for a subscription to Brit Box and few others, but hey, at least it looks pretty.
 "
Blithe Spirit,28,41,critic,"
Blithe Spirit whipsaws between slapstick material with a particular focus on invisible objects, and hoary jokes about erectile dysfunction that are neither frisky nor funny. They just sort of hang in the air like bad spirits.

There's a lot in the pot ... including some good flavors. This is not, however, a dish that fully comes together.

You can't improve on Coward, and there's no re-animating this corpse.

Blithe Spirit has the right spirit at heart, but fails to conjure up any laughs, from beginning to end.
 "

This new production is a major misfire.
 "
Blithe Spirit,28,41,critic,"
Blithe Spirit floats away and never quite retains the gravity of its various predecessors.

Blithe Spirit,28,41,critic,"
While the story in this latest adaptation plays out largely the same as the original, it feels problematically dated and not especially funny.
 "
Blithe Spirit,28,41,critic,"
""Blithe Spirit"" is a spiritless version of Sir Noel Coward's 1941 supernatural comic play.
 "
Blithe Spirit,28,41,critic,"
Coward's storyline feels painfully dated, and the efforts by the new writers to goose things up with references to the pre-war equivalent of Viagra seem to go in the wrong direction entirely.
 "
Blithe Spirit,28,41,critic,"
At just 95 minutes, the film's relatively short running time still feels stretched to the limits. A decided lack of dizzy, silly, fizzy screwball fun beyond a few scattered moments doesn't help matters.

It's dated humor that's not improved by its update, but the acting is aces.
 "
Blithe Spirit,28,41,critic,"
Director Edward Hall and writers Piers Ashworth, Meg Leonard and Nick Moorcroft have taken Coward's premise and pumped extra sugar into it, as well as some unnecessary preservatives.
 "
Blithe Spirit,28,41,critic,"
​​​It's an almost impressive feat to make a decidedly unfunny adaptation of a Noel Coward play and yet, Edward Hall's new film based on the 1941 play Blithe Spirit does exactly that.

The Mauritanian,73,85,audience,"Very overrated. I’m a big Hanks fan, but the ratings this flick is getting are a joke. "
The Mauritanian,73,85,audience,The history. But would have rented at home. Went very long.
The Mauritanian,73,85,audience,The most consequential movie of the season. A must see for all.
The Mauritanian,73,85,audience,"Whoever destroys one life destroys the world entire.  

That would be my quote to describe the brutality of humanity depicted in this movie which sadly is not fiction.  

I don't regret watching it since I have done so already but I do not recommend it to my friends and here's why.    I've watched Schindler's list 4 times but I can never watch this again, although I admit it is a great movie.  

The torture that was done to one (as apposed to many in schindler's list) had me experience the opposite emotion I felt in the last scene of schindler's list.  

Imagine the same level of love you see in this scene but the polar opposite.  The only word I have to describe it is evil, and keep in mind i never use the word evil because i don't believe in evil."
The Mauritanian,73,85,audience,This is a must-see movie.   The acting is incredible and this horrible part of American history must be told!!
The Mauritanian,73,85,audience,"Heavily politicized movie trying to display muslim terrorists as victims. Such narrative is become more and more popular these days, especially in europe. It's a very sad trend."
The Mauritanian,73,85,audience,"The Mauritanian (in theaters and on Prime at Movie theater price) is another movie about 9/11 detainees this one based on the critically acclaimed memoir 
Guantánamo Diary.  Long story short you will be much better off watching  ""The Report"" (2019) (on amazon prime). This movie has a bad case of white savior syndrome (Foster's character) coupled with Cumberbatch attempting to alligator wrestle a southern accent (and losing comically).   Cumberbatch's battle is doubly bad as his character serves no point (other than to commit an ethics violation that for his sake I hope the film made up) and in real life has barely any accent at all (let alone Foghorn Leghorn presents Mark Twain that Benedict is aiming for).  Tahar Rahim (as the title character) is pretty fantastic and deserves the praise he is getting.   It is slow and like the movie (Spotlight) leads you only to ""new"" information if you have been living under a rock.  (and has one of the worst cases of post movie texts being a more interesting story than most of what you just saw).  2 1/2 stars out of 5 (mostly for Tahar)"
The Mauritanian,73,85,audience,Magnificently acted and well written in presenting complicated judicial elements with ease and bringing out little by little the emotional depth necessary to fully accomplish the characters journey with a really liberating momentum. The movie makes a clever use of dispersed flashbacks in another aspect ratio and moves confindently in apparently common ground but i think that what was exactly needed to bring clarity to the whole affair and bring justice to the story. Foster and Rahim bring strong performances and the movie is relentlessly breathtaking storywise. Great idea to end with real video material of the actual mauritanian.
The Mauritanian,73,85,audience,"It was good, thrilling and powerful. The acting was also great. I'm not watching it again but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it."
The Mauritanian,73,85,audience,True story. Main character needs to be treated differently.

Mauritanian is a reminder not only of the horrific injustices the U.S. government has committed in its war on terrorism but also that there are still men being held at Guantánamo to this day.

 "
The Mauritanian,73,85,critic,"
A generally engrossing true story about a national stain that forgets, or glosses over, the things that make good movies great.
 "
The Mauritanian,73,85,critic,"
""The Mauritanian"" has the elements of a slow-burn government thriller, and Macdonald slowly turns up the heat, never boiling over or steering into overwrought or grandstanding territory.
 "
The Mauritanian,73,85,critic,"
The Mauritanian tries to build toward a nightmarish crescendo, as we finally glimpse the physical and psychological torments Slahi was subjected to. But the filmmaking isn't inspired enough to lend even that horrific content the force one might expect
 "
The Mauritanian,73,85,critic,"
French Algerian actor Tahar Rahim imbues Salahi with intelligent, casual, almost finicky humanity, refusing to play the Mauritanian as a figurehead.
 "
The Mauritanian,73,85,critic,"
Its occasional clumsiness can be pardoned in light of its successes and it's a bold effort to explore in fiction an environment that has already been the subject of several documentaries.

Judas and the Black Messiah,96,94,audience,"Kaluuya's striking, cathartic performance here is everything. So powerful that O'Neal can even feel kind of underwritten at some point. Although there was something missing for me, still don't know what... maybe some more confrontation.

The truth is that I didn't know much about the story, so it did work perfectly as a history class. It's definitely a hard watch because even though these events took place more than fifty years ago, this ""war"" is still fought today."

Judas and the Black Messiah,96,94,audience,"An astounding work of art speaking of the horrors and beauties of our American history and lives. Echoes and reflections between the past and the present are in no short supply along with heaps of pride, satisfaction and dread from the opening to the end credits.
Having no choice but to live up to its name, you know the tragic ending to come but the emotional journey and unifying messages throughout the film are more than you'd expect.
This film is revolutionary. This film is for the people."
Judas and the Black Messiah,96,94,audience,"Sometimes the movie feels devoid of energy or drama which given the material is a little surprising. Still, the central performances make it worth a viewing."

Beautifully crafted and a superb history lesson. The production design and cinematography are particularly rewarding, all the performances are solid, and the score is phenomenal.

I would have preferred more focus on the politics of the time but it's the human drama that makes it so gripping.
 "

King directs Judas and the Black Messiah like he's doing more than chronicling history. He is, of course.
 "

This is a film made with a sense of outrage; although the events occurred so long ago, the ramifications that they led to are clearly still being felt in the US.

If you're a sucker for interesting true stories, Judas and the Black Messiah is a film you must see.
 "
Judas and the Black Messiah,96,94,critic,"
What Shaka King offers is instead a timely reminder, written in the slick, bold font of a major studio production, that racism is systemic, and it goes all the way to the top -- and, crucially, that it feeds on the underdeveloped political consciousness.
 "
Judas and the Black Messiah,96,94,critic,"
As a political statement, Judas is powerful, a quite relevant revisiting of an American past that, as William Faulkner would have observed, isn't even past.
 "
Judas and the Black Messiah,96,94,critic,"
King refuses to make this movie into yet another Great Man biopic ... [rather,] the struggle between institutionalised power and revolutionary potential takes centre stage.
 "
Judas and the Black Messiah,96,94,critic,"
With its terrifying relevance in the present day, questions for viewers to ask themselves and determination to effect change, Judas and the Black Messiah is equally as strong as a biopic, thriller and political drama.

Kaluuya is terrific..

Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,audience,"The film doesn't take itself seriously. If it did it would be insufferable. Barb and Star are characters you care about, Star does end becoming a little too much for me though. The biggest problem is how stereotypical it is. Everything you think is gonna happen, happens. The jokes land flat sometimes but it didn't bother me. I loved this movie."
Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,audience,"This is the comedy we didn't know we needed. 

In a time when fluff is underrated, here comes Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo to save the day with this silly (even tacky), bonkers, candy-colored comedy, also with Jamie Dornan giving us some new shades we didn't know existed. Everyone involved in this film was like: ""I'm gonna do whatever the f**k I want to""... and so they (epically) did. 

From unexpected and absurd musical numbers to Morgan Freeman incarnated in a crab, this humorous spectacle will definitely give you some good, out-loud laughs from the very beginning until the credits roll."
Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,audience,"Since the start of the pandemic, there really haven't been too many straight up comedies.  Lots of horror, plenty of indie movies (including some with a ""comedic"" tough) and loads of dramas.  But good, fun, ""Friday night date night"" comedies?  Not so much.  So along comes BARB AND STAR..., and clearly this movie is not aiming for awards-show glory.  Watch the trailer...if what you see amuses you, watch the film.  It makes a delightful, bubbly, utterly silly diversion.  I DEEPLY appreciate the film for giving me a 100 minute diversion that required me to make no intellectual investment and had two stars that clearly were quite invested in their work.  It's a delight to look at, and I felt darn good after watching it.  4.5 stars!!!

BUT, now, two days later, I have to be honest.  I was so starved to see a silly comedy, I completely overlooked the fact that much of this movie is a mess.  2.5 stars in a non-COVID world.  So let's call it 3.5.

I know, I know...I'm a total party pooper and is it fair to rate the film this way?  I've rated all other films I've ever reviewed based on how they struck me when watching.  Is it right that I give this one a big asterisk for cheering me up during a dark time?  I don't know...but I have to say that the disconnect between my experience watching it and my experience thinking about it later makes me think that I DO need to review based on a bit of reflection.  

So, it tells the story of Barb & Star, who live (if memory serves) somewhere in Nebraska, and have roomed together for years, ever since divorces/widowhood.  (Their ""hometown"" scenes were actually filmed in Socorro, NM...which is about 75 minutes down the road from me.)  They never desire to move much outside their safe little community, and working at their furniture store.  They are frivolous characters, and they are totally fine with that.  A shakeup happens in their lives though, and they take the advice of a friend and spring for a vacation in Vista del Mar, Florida, at a painfully brightly colored resort, just to try something new and have a good time.  Day One, they meet a handsome, younger Irish man at the bar (Jamie Dornan) who is having a bad day, already drunk, and the 3 have quite a night together.  One that most people might have some regrets about the next day.  But their relationships blossom from there, in fun but silly ways.

But in the midst of this frivolity is a plot to kill the citizens of Vista del Mar by a super-villain who lives in a lair!  (Her primary  henchman is Jamie Dornan!)  So the two plots converge in ways that take this film from silly to absolutely ridiculous, but not always in a good way.

I was totally fine with the silliness (even though Dornan, game as he is, just never quite seems to capture the tone.  His solo song was a highlight of the film, but the rest of the time, I was wishing for a more comedically adept actor).  The bright colors.  The silly dialogue.  The visual jokes.  All fine.  But then the idea of taking this frothy film, and forcing a ""spy plot"" onto it only ends up being funny on paper.  The actual viewing of the last 15 minutes or so of the film is really deeply unfunny, and ham-fisted and just not interesting.  I think they could have taken the basic characters of Barb and Star and put them into a silly film that DIDN'T go off the rails, and would have achieved something really memorable.

Anyway, if you, like me, are craving a film that is set in a world not at all like our own (in the silliest possible way), you should enjoy this film.  If you want a ""smart"" movie...please look elsewhere!  Thank you, BARB AND STAR, for cheering me up for an evening.  It was kinda like eating a whole box of chocolates, though...I felt some regret the next day."
Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,audience,"Unexpectedly tender, yet full of wit, surprises and one-liners that you'll remember for a long time. Destined to be the next Nacho Libre or Napoleon Dynamite cult classic!"
Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,audience,"What a disappointment, as my wife and I love Kristen Wiig. I'm so upset we wasted $20 as this movie was not funny, void of a coherent story line. 
My wife did enjoy the Trish discussion. I especially enjoyed this as Trish was Reba McEntire....whom my wife doesn't care for. This did make me laugh. 
I would advise skipping this KW attempt and cheer her on for her next movie."
Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,audience,"Ufff, needs more songs"
Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,audience,"""You saw all my folds and holes.""

The formula of two unaware and somewhat dim best friends stumbling into a plot with larger implications than their small, vacuum of an existence can even comprehend but of which they become the only hope in saving the rest of humanity (or at least the rest of the resort town they're visiting) is not a new one, but Josh Greenbaum's Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar which was written by and stars the incomparable Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo who previously collaborated on Bridesmaids certainly does everything in its absurd power to give said concept a whole new look. Walking the line between completely trashing the small Midwestern middle-aged woman and absolutely adoring everything that makes their quaint, innocent lives so enviable Wiig's Star and Mumolo's Barb are the best of friends and have been so for so long they've kind of morphed into one another or one big feathered hairdo of excessive sweetness, wonder, and bliss. Their lives have followed similar trajectories to the point they've both ended up working in the same mall furniture store post-divorce, get fired from said store on the same day, and kicked out of their ""Talking Club"" on the same night for lying about still having those jobs at the furniture store. In what feels like the biggest departure the two could possibly make from their cozy, insulated existence the two decide to kick-off this next phase of their lives by embarking on the adventure of a lifetime by leaving their small Midwestern town for the first time ever. 

Arriving in the fictional Vista Del Mar or the oasis of all ""mid-lifers"" as Wendi McLendon-Covey's Mickey would say, Barb and Star are essentially aliens arriving on a different planet and discovering different forms of life than they've ever encountered before. Chief among these specimens in Jamie Dornan's Edgar who, unbeknownst to our titular heroes, is there at the behest of his Dr. Evil-like boss (also played by Wiig) to enact a revenge plot for some ridiculous reason that doesn't make much sense, but doesn't have to because nothing here - except how much you laugh - is taken seriously. All that matters is that Barb and Star are now caught-up in a love triangle, something even more daring and scandalous than leaving their comfortable routine, while beginning to lie to one another for the first time in what is probably the history of Barb and Star. Surrounded by the brightest shades of orange and turquoise possible as well as the largest cocktails ever concocted, our heroines follow the predictable narrative arc laid out before them, but what elevates the film to a different plane of comedy is the specificity Mumolo and Wiig have written with. The jokes - whether verbal, visual, or musical lampoons - each come so quick that they feel effortless, but by the time the entire picture is revealed feel that much more thought-out and almost exquisitely crafted. Dornan nearly steals the movie with the show-stopping ""Edgar's Prayer"" number that made me laugh harder at a movie than I think I have in a decade if not more. Dornan completely understands the tone of the world he's in and more specifically, how he fits into it. Other supporting players like Vanessa Bayer, Mark Jonathan Davis, Damon Wayans Jr., and Karen Maruyama each add to the bizarre nature of the world this film exists in. Special shout-out to Reyn Doi though, who essentially put me in this movie's pocket from the very beginning with his rendition of Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb's ""Guilty"". It's easy to note with its very specific brand of comedy that Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar isn't for everyone, but the ongoing outlandishness of it all and the admitted stupidity is what made the experience such a delight, especially having come along at this point in time.

 "
Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,critic,"
Sometimes a funny thing can and should be funny simply for the sake of being funny. Barb and Star is unconcerned with the pandemic, political infighting or the uncertainties of life in the 21st century, and that's exactly as it should be.
 "
Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,critic,"
It's like spending 90 minutes inside a fever dream a Kristin Wiig '80s sketch character might have if she got high inside some kind of Mars Cheese Castle/Dylan's Candy Bar co-op. And I loved it.
 "

Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,critic,"
A delightfully silly, warm and moving film, and a paean to middle-aged female friendship. Also I discovered I'd been pronouncing ""culottes"" wrong my whole life.

While traveling is not advisable, Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar makes for a great cinematic getaway. It also helps that it is wonderfully funny and energetic the whole way through.

Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar is, like its name, highly silly. And silly is a mood that movies lately totally underuse.

The two ladies are as frothy and delightful as machine-churned piña coladas, and their partnership builds up to what has to be the single greatest joke about culottes ever conceived.

""The colors: bright; the mood: uncertain; the vibe: distinctive. And at its heart, a mystery.""
 "
Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar,79,63,critic,"
To call it a trip is an understatement. Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar is a tumble down a piña-colada-fuelled rabbit hole. Once through the looking glass, it's an uncanny but thoroughly enjoyable time.

 "
The World to Come,73,62,audience,"""The world to come"" begins with a good narrative, but with the course of events everything becomes tiring and predictable, in addition, the level of performances declines due to the characters not having the feeling of those who live in the time portrayed in the film. The good part is that it is a very elegant story."
The World to Come,73,62,audience,"Modern values in the 1800s were too anachronistic and contrived to suspend my disbelief. They were obviously too focussed on pushing a political narrative than crafting a believable plot, and probably the only reason why this film is currently being fawned over by ""progressive"" critics. Sorry, but this film was dull as dishwater."
The World to Come,73,62,audience,A movie that wasn’t needed to be made no principle story whatsoever
The World to Come,73,62,audience,"I will not recommend to watch this movie. 
Every good story has a message or lesson to learn by the end of it. 
In a good story the protagonists would go through a change, from the way they were in the beginning to the way they are in the end, and (hopefully) will be in a better place.  
Not in this story. In this story there no lesson to learn, nor there a meaning to all that happened. The 'hero' will begin and end in the same place she where, if not a little bit more worse. If there were messages in this movie, they would be that: women not equal to men, there is no hope for two women in love. That the bad man win and the good man stay married to a woman that would never love him back like he deserved. For the good points of the movie? The view of the seasons changing ware beautiful to watch, and with better story and different ending to all the characters involved, that could have been a pretty good movie"

The World to Come,73,62,audience,"The World to Come is a beautiful love story that is well made and well acted. Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby were both great. They have excellent chemistry together. The film is well helmed from director Mona Fastvold. The production design and the costumes are wonderful. I was also a big fan of the score. The score complemented what was on screen perfectly. The film is very restrained, which I appreciated. It hits all the beats you’d expect from a forbidden love story but it’s just done so well. I do think the film could’ve been longer, but other than that I really enjoyed this. Overall, this was great. It’s a shame people aren’t talking about this film more. I hope more people decide to check it out. "

The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
Brit actress Vanessa Kirby is having quite a run over the past four years or so. Period pieces. Straight drama and action films. She seems to be able to do anything.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
Waterston and Kirby give it their all, and their passion on screen is electrifying.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
What stands out is the way that Fastvold's film renders the furtive, the inexpressible, the typically-repressed in primary color. The ties grow between Abigail and Tallie feel unencumbered, afloat with a sense of joyous implausibility.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby showcase the importance of friendship and romance in struggling times for women.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
A visually beautiful period piece where the two female leads have zero chemistry and the voice-over narration is too much.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
The World to Come doesn't offer queer viewers anything revelatory in the realm of lesbian period romance... but its audiovisual creativity might very well justify Fastvold's adaptation of yet another sad Sapphic story.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
A moving, engrossing period drama about the plight of two farming women trapped in unhappy marriages.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
The film offers a small bit of emotional rescue at its very end-a graceful tribute to the escapes of memory and fantasy-but by then the dourness of its conclusions has blotted out any rounder sense of meaning. There is not much world to come, after all
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
It will undoubtedly-and deservedly-be embraced by LGBTQ viewers, but such self-identification isn't necessary to appreciate it. One merely need to be human.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
Waterston and Kirby build a captivating atmosphere of intimacy and tenderness that is as genuine as it is achingly believable. But unfortunately, their talents are almost too big for the story...
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
A great cast anchored by Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby's chemistry elevates this forbidden romance drama. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
The World to Come is further proof that Vanessa Kirby is one of the best actresses of her generation and that Katherine Waterston is one of the most boring ones.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
Grueling depiction of life on the farm circa mid 1800's. Both lead actresses excel but their male co-stars are left in the dust.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
Beyond the deft handling of the central crisis, what impresses most is how Fastvold recreates the period details and quotidian labor.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
When they finally introduce an actual plot twist, about 80 minutes in, we're distressingly relieved by the tragic development, just happy to have something to hold onto.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
Despite the great cast, director Mona Fastvold (The Mustang) creates less than picturesque settings for the uncomfortable lives of these people and for us as an audience.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
The World To Come is the most consuming sort of love story. Equally tragic and hopeful, but always beautiful. ... thoughtfully written and lovingly performed ...
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
The World to Come plays like a well-made but familiar genre piece.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
The World to Come has commendable attributes, but I was expecting so much more.
 "
The World to Come,73,62,critic,"
""The World to Come"" may be a bit gloomy, but the romance it depicts is stirring.

The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,audience,"A charming teen romance using the groundhog day concept that isn't anything super fresh or unique but delivers one what you want from these movies.

Grade: B"
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,audience,"This movie was not on my radar at all; When I first watched the movie it almost, made me cry."
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,audience,"The way in which Kyle Allen's Mark embraces his new normal in this movie is how I wish I could approach everything in life. 

The other really nice thing about this entry in the time loop genre is that despite the obvious comparisons to Palm Springs, it still really lands the emotional gut-punch of an ending in just enough of a different way that it once again makes this now tired-feeling trope as valuable as it ever was."
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,audience,"What a great movie, good storyline. Good moral.  Not the groundhog remake you think, completely different. Really glad I washed it keep your tissues handy!"

The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,audience,"If I was experiencing Groundhog Day and found someone else experiencing it with me, I think the first thing I would ask is how long have you been doing this. Not sure how they missed that in this one. Otherwise decent though fairly predictable."

 "
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
Director Ian Samuels has some fun with this carefree premise, infusing it with long takes and zippy montages and a few self-reflexive jokes (shoutout Kurt Godel!), but he also takes the time to flesh out Mark and Margaret... to amusing effect.
 "

The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is a new spin on young love that will stimulate your mind and touch your heart.
 "
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
Even though it has teen protagonists, optimists and dreamers of any age will enjoy ""The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,"" a lighthearted lark into an alternate universe that is also entirely recognizable, particularly around here.
 "
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
If it doesn't make nearly enough of its existential possibilities, it's not without a certain juvenile charm.
 "
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is good. It hits the feels when it needs to, and both leads are endearing and have a chemistry that just works. Sometimes you don't need to rebuild the time-loop to have a good time, and this film shows that.
 "

Kathryn Newton and Kyle Allen's performances are solid enough to keep us entertained...

The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
You'll likely view The Map of Tiny Perfect Things as low stakes, young adult frivolity, but its primary goal isn't jokes...
 "
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
If the chemistry between the two leads had been more potent, and the soundtrack super catchy, this would have been a time-looper film for the ages. But as a fun Valentine's Day watch, or for a romantic evening, you could do a lot worse.
 "

Satisfying standalone entry in the ever more present time loop subgenre. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, etc. - also Available)

The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
Aside from some scattered laughs and endearing portrayals, the calculated result is hardly memorable.
 "
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
It seems as if we've seen this set-up before and it's getting tiresome.
 "
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
Matters do get more serious, but in the end, it's underdeveloped fluff - fun, mind you, but still fluff.
 "
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
It attempts to be mind-blowing, but it comes off as someone trying too hard in a high school philosophy class instead.

The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things' tiny, little flaws are easy to overlook because it's just so fun. At its core, it's a refreshing, feel-good teen story perfect for anyone who wants a little escape from reality.
 "
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
In the process of merging formulas, ""The Map of Tiny Perfect Things"" recycles the same material it seems inclined to rejuvenate, one step at a time.
 "
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things,78,75,critic,"
An admirable effort fails to compensate for the fact that this is all pretty standard issue fare with a very familiar ring to it -- sweet natured, good hearted but also bland.

Familiar but likable teen time loop tale; cursing, drinking.

Land,70,84,audience,Beautiful scenes and good acting.   NO FOUL LANGUAGE!!!   Nice way to spend a couple hours!
Land,70,84,audience,Outstanding. What an interesting plot.
Land,70,84,audience,It didn’t make any sense why anybody in the right mind would go up in the mountains with any experience who survived in the wilderness without some provisions.
Land,70,84,audience,She found the will to live and heal and he found someone to save to ease his pain. Touching story. The Shoshone National Forest is stunning.
Land,70,84,audience,"I'm not much into movies about sad cases, they're depressing. I can't deduct stars because I don't enjoy the genre of the story though. I thought the reason for how she lost her husband and son was a little flaky. Otherwise the movie was very well done."
Land,70,84,audience,For her first movie it was enjoyable. The scenery of course was fantastic. Its a good movie as there are so many people who have  experienced such tragic losses.
Land,70,84,audience,"Very touching story... the scenery is breathtaking from Alberta, Canada. Well acted directed by Robin Wright!"
Land,70,84,audience,"Very interesting how the person survived!
Scenery was beautiful!"
Land,70,84,audience,"Robin Wright directs a solid story about a woman leaving everything behind, that boosts strong performances from not only her, but also a surprising one from Demian Bichir."
Land,70,84,audience,Loved the story and scenery.
Land,70,84,critic,"
The performances are honest and compelling, and the journey feels intimately rendered even if the script falls into some tropes about the city person trying to make it on her own in the wilds.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
The point of wilderness survival for early Native-Americans was to get the hunting, trapping, fishing, etc, to become second nature, so as to have enough time to get to the spiritual stuff. Robin Wright's character in ""Land"" gets to the spiritual stuff.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Possessing all the character depth of a not-very-good paperback romance novel, 'Land's' gorgeous location photography hardly compensates for its very basic emotional manipulations. Robin Wright's onscreen presence, however, does make this tolerable.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
I wasn't really moved by this story, but I did respect it's granular, day-by-day storytelling.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
A very controlled character piece that enables [Robin Wright] to do what she needs to do as a director and as an actress.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
There's not much one can say about Wright's directorial debut, really. It looks great and it means well, but it just isn't much of anything.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Wright's directorial debut is a visually striking and deeply affecting tale about searching peace and a new sense of meaning. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Land is an emotionally rich examination of the way love and grief are intertwined.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Robin Wright's directorial feature film debut is one of gorgeous landscapes and showcases the power of human connections.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
As a rumination on processing grief and finding one's way back to life, the film is mostly successful at being something interesting and thoughtful...
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Themes of recovering from tragedy and surviving a fatal dose of grief flutter throughout, though we find, by film's end, that we along with Edee are yearning for human interaction and... meaning.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
It's painful, bleak, and shockingly beautiful, a true grieving esthete's meditation on life and loss . It's not easy, but it's soul-stirring.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Wright's directorial debut is beautiful to watch but the story is sluggish and not especially unique in concept.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
This quiet, surprisingly impactful drama is lovingly performed and directed by the talented Wright.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Wright and her co-star Demian Bichir draw a powerful but restrained portrait of two souls attempting to recover from unimaginable loss by subjecting themselves to circumstances that seem literally impossible to survive.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Robin Wright's stark survivalist story is a chronicle of spiritual renewal...
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Robin Wright's agreeable debut strikes enough genuine chords to whisk along patient audience members.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Wright's performance is haunting and touching. She keeps you wondering about her motivations. Did she run away for a fresh start or for a prolonged suicide.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
Her journey is inert, and all the most beautiful natural world vistas in the world can't make it any more compelling.
 "
Land,70,84,critic,"
I found it engaging and heartbreaking at times, grounded by Wright's work in front of and behind the camera. (Full Content Review for Parents - Nudity, etc. - also Available)

Bliss,27,43,audience,"A topsy turvy aesthetic from the get-go and the whole way through. It’s a little meandering at times, but with patience and curiosity the finality is rewarding. Salma and Owen are terrific in their performances. Bliss has a thoughtful message conveyed in a creative way."
Bliss,27,43,audience,"I cannot even follow what is happening. I am guessing it is just the inside look of the head of people on drugs.  this movie is absolutely terrible.  Like a matrix idea, but no explanation and impossible to follow."
Bliss,27,43,audience,Real stinker! Couldn't get more than 30 minutes in.
Bliss,27,43,audience,"A nice fantasy.  I'm a big fan of both Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek, so maybe not everyone would enjoy.  But it definitely held my interest."
Bliss,27,43,audience,"I liked the lead actor's performances, and the ideas, but the crew totally blundered in regards to execution."
Bliss,27,43,audience,"Bliss was far better than the critics' reviews, who 1) kept trying to make it be something it wasn't and 2) then giving it a failing grade for not being the thing it wasn't.  It isn't a grand sci-fi epic that explains all things.  It's a small scale question: are these two people actually in a simulation or just homeless drug addicts with delusions of power?  I thought Owen Wilson and Selma Hayek did a great job at keeping the question open for most of the movie.  The time gaps and changes in perspective were visually compelling.  They were both believable as street folk, and I was worried for them.  Sure, the last quarter of the movie was a bit underfleshed out...why would Selma Hayek ""kill"" their only source? And how would going back properly help the future timeline? It seemed a string of arbitrary bad decisions.  But all in all, I really enjoyed it,  Good performances from both leads and well-directed.  The critics were just wrong here."
Bliss,27,43,audience,"I watched this movie to the end and that alone was torturous. I watched it because the cast included Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek.  Amazon should really focus on doing what they do best. Sell stuff.  The entire movie I tried not to make sense out of it, but to actually find what the plot was.
It was poor garbage.  Salma's acting was mediocre at best. The best part of the movie were the scenes by Nesta Cooper (the daughter).  Was the only times I felt a plot was going to show up.  Owen's acting was just okay. Often, like reading a script.
Bad movie."
Bliss,27,43,audience,"Sorry, but such a waste of my time and the creators' efforts. 
Why? The story did NOT have a central theme. It was a love story b/t the two main characters, OK. It was also a tale of a man caught b/t 2 worlds. OK. It was also the story of family rupture. OK.... Not ONE of these themes were resolved, nor explored enough to have it matter. Sadly, I can only believe that the director/ producers said 'We can do a Matrix kind of film but different!'. They took all the Matrix themes yes, but addressed them so poorly. What a disappointment, what a waste of time."
Bliss,27,43,audience,"I'm surprised to find such low ratings. I think this movie depicts the human experience of drug abuse. I thought it was powerful, for often people say how can a person choose drugs over family, it's for the false reality of bliss. The representation, presented like a sci-fi storyline I enjoyed from start to finish. It didn't leave questions for me, it summed up the lack of reality the main characters believed. If you or someone you love is an addict, the presentation of false facts created by users, the high, the come down, the recovery moment is so compelling in this movie. The director nailed it from my perspective."
Bliss,27,43,audience,"After watching this movie and being left confused, it took me some time to realize, that's exactly what the director wanted. I love that viewers are able to draw their own conclusions and it's a welcomed change to the typical basic storylines. Loved it! I only recommend if you do not want to be told every single detail from beginning to end."
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Despite its inventive premise, Bliss is too convoluted and dull to make its genre mix and message work. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Mike Cahill's ambitious science-fiction/psychological drama Bliss suffers from two extremely big drawbacks. First, its convoluted, minutia-obsessed ""Matrix-Lite"" screenplay...
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
While there are moments of engagement and some memorable images, Bliss simply doesn't hold together enough to make its ideas-however fascinating-stick.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Outside of a few engaging visual techniques, Cahill only observes the film's meaningful conditions on a surface level.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
More bound to leave you confused and unhappy than in a state of bliss.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Fun? Quite tiresome, actually.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
There's nothing to pull Bliss together and make it feel like anything beyond new-age junk science.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
By the time the movie lifts the curtain to show its wizard, it's too late. The answers he comes up with would have been intriguing if the film's tired gimmick hadn't made the film so darn mopey.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Confusing sci-fi drama has drugs, violence, language.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
[A] strange purgatory of insipid ideas constantly conflicting with one another until the film's slow walk to a predictable, albeit emotionally cloying conclusion.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Bliss can be magical, but it may not always rise to the heights of the complex tale it attempts to weave together.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Too bad writer-director Mike Cahill flooded his movie with too many unanswered questions and it doesn't help that he loves to go ambiguous in a terribly muddled manner.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
An exhausting, draining film that constantly feels like it's being done on the fly with no sense of logic or point.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Bliss is a movie whose ambitions outstripped its execution. Mike Cahill is a legitimate talent, the kind of auteur of whom genre filmmaking could use more, but his eyes were bigger than his stomach on this one.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Surreal touches and a moody tone give this intriguing film a dreamlike quality, as writer-director Mike Cahill explores the nature of reality through the eyes of people going through trauma.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
The messages within the film are equally engaging, reminding us to cherish our immediate world and relationships.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Even the worst simulation would have more clarity than this. Life might be messy and weird and scary, but it possesses more honesty than this cinematic misery.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
It's certainly great to see Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek work outside their norm, but Bliss doesn't fully recover in the end.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Bliss could not figure out what kind of film it wanted to be, as the convoluted story never finds its footing.
 "
Bliss,27,43,critic,"
Too caught up in its own inventive twist on the world, Bliss offers high concept science fiction without tying it to something meaningful.
 "
Falling,66,46,audience,"A very powerful story and performance by Viggo; this film depicts some of the greatest  challenges of aging parents with dementia, generational change, and the cruelest resistance from fearful conservative parents."
Falling,66,46,audience,"Nice first effort for Viggo, but ultimately lacks insight and an effective message."
Falling,66,46,audience,Great story and SUPERB acting!!
Falling,66,46,audience,"Falling has solid acting, but is letdown by its weak screenplay. Viggo Mortensen and Lance Henriksen are both great in their roles. While their characters are underwritten, the performances themselves were solid. This is Mortensen’s first time as a director, and I thought he was fine. His direction wasn’t anything special but it was competent enough. Sadly, this writing abilities aren’t as good. The film is filled with cliches and not much else. Henriksen’s character is so unlikeable that he becomes unbearable at times. The film can also get repetitive and boring. Overall, this was a mixed bag. Some moments really do work. But others are just flat and boring. "
Falling,66,46,audience,Too many disjointed flashbacks and random scenes which did not bring any closure at the end of the movie.  I found it very weird and did not really enjoy watching it.
Falling,66,46,audience,"I felt the movie was very true to a generation that is fading. In addition it brings to light the issues of Dementia, a disease that many will experience as they age. I could relate to a lot of the scenes that were portrayed as the main character went through the stages of a disease that is very cruel to both the victims and the loved one of the afflicted. The movie also brings to light the differences in a generation that was much more conservative and was not concerned with being politically correct. This movie had me riveted right up to the last scene which was both cruel and kind at the same time. I truly enjoyed it and would recommend it. Part of its charm was also in the cinematography and the playing out of both the story of the past paralleled with  present day life."
Falling,66,46,audience,"The film deals with memories, old age, time and patience. I really liked the use of flashbacks and the narrative type, in the middle of the film the script begins to repeat itself, but it does not take away the magic of ""The Falling"""
Falling,66,46,audience,"While its a hard hitting tale of troubling father/son relationships, Mortensen plays the dialogue out like he is producing a play, and not a two-hour feature that would be interesting for any watching audience. You will be left uninspired and rather bored."
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Falling for Mortensen's work as an actor is one thing, but his directorial debut is a lot harder to fall for.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Has a certain base competence to it, but the takeaway is ambiguous as it reaches for a lyricism that never coalesces.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Based on a largely superficial grasp of American social life, the stock in trade of Hollywood liberalism, Mortensen's film is neither terribly convincing nor terribly perceptive.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Falling fails to justify why the audience should care about and uncomfortably endure this draining melodrama of a wretched mean-spirited human being and his enabling codependent accomplice.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
The strength, patience and universal need to forgive and bridge generational gaps Mr. Mortensen is aiming for have a devastating effect.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
It's a bold approach, but too often ""Falling"" comes off just as incorrigible as its lead character.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Trying to generate sympathy for its characters, Mortensen's screenplay winds up wallowing in their misery.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Lance Henriksen gives one of the great ""rage, rage against the dying of the light"" performances
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Some successful, but mostly not...
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
It's beautifully done and intense with some very dramatic scenes.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Ultimately, this grueling, overlong picture - think a chamber piece but with multiple characters and locations - never zeroes in on what it wants us to think or feel about Willis or John. But if it's sympathy, it doesn't get there.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
To add shading, Mortensen includes scenes -- moments, really -- in which Willis shows genuine affection for his son...providing much-needed nuance about the complexity of a bullying relationship.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
There's a lot of realism in this, and that's what makes it work.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
You have to give Mortensen credit though for his uncompromising viewpoint. Still, ""Falling"" is an agonizing watch.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Mortensen draws on his experience as a committed, collaborative actor of intense emotional truth and deep research for his powerhouse late-career directing debut. The result is a visceral and urgent drama.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
First-time feature director Viggo Mortensen auspiciously writes, composes, produces and copes with fab co-star Lance Henricksen, as a combustible father spitting out deep-rooted prejudices now without mental filters being slowly disabled by dementia.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Falling is engrossing as a drama while equally vile and revolting in Henriksen's career-topping supporting turn.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
A provocative, well-made piece.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
Falling is a look at dementia, but done in a way that's unlike how almost any other movie has gone about it.
 "
Falling,66,46,critic,"
It's impressive work all around. [Mortensen] has a sure hand and mostly excellent judgment.

Together Together,90,,critic,"
Though I have nothing nasty to say about the genial comedy, I can't say it knocked me off my feet.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
Together Together is a smart and sweet take on an unconventional relationship.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
The film has one of those whip-smart screenplays that avoids just about every story-telling pitfall you can imagine spinning out of this premise.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
The dramedy is only Beckwith's second feature, but despite its familiarity, it's a pleasurable and refreshing experience. It's light and witty, often packed with laughs and touching moments, with two stellar lead performances at its heart.

If the phrase ""it's nice to be nice"" took on film form, it would probably look a lot like Together Together.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
It's an obvious arc, but Helms and Harrison exude some disarming sugar-and-spice chemistry.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
Together Together is a remarkably restrained spin on a ""quirky comedy,"" celebrating platonic love and the many strange ways that we find family for ourselves - and it's never quite what you'd expect.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
The clean middle-class look of the film goes a long way to reassure everyone that there's nothing troubling or problematic here.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
This is truly a warm hug of a movie; funny, comforting, and ultimately a reminder of the importance of human connection. A real gem of a film. Discover it, you won't be disappointed.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
Adult viewers should expect to be under the spell of this fetching dramedy for 80 of its 90 minutes.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
A charming and heartwarming story about friendship, surrogacy, and platonic love.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
Helms brings a familiar but welcome energy -- it's the newer actor, Harrison, who guides the movie to its more complicated and comical places.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
Patti Harrison is a star. And while Helms is just fine, he's also playing a character who's about one-tenth as interesting as Harrison's.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
Beckwith puts a platonic bond front and centre with the same level of care usually reserved for romantic partners.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
Together Together gets a lot of bonus points for being a story both about paternal desires and platonic love, but's also a good reminder that sometimes stories can just be nice.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
Well-paced with deep, thoughtful characters and subject matter, Together Together soars.
 "
Together Together,90,,critic,"
Helms and newcomer Harrison are both likable and engaging performers, but they are let down by a screenplay that starts with an intriguing idea but largely squanders it on a series of increasingly formulaic plot developments.
 "
First Blush,83,,critic,"
Neumark takes the high road here and the triumvirate's coming together is not all about sex. Sure, it is in part, but emotions involved are also addressed.
 "
First Blush,83,,critic,"
The acting is patchy throughout, contributing to the sense that this film has been put together without sufficient thought.
 "
First Blush,83,,critic,"
While First Blush has a few missteps that stifle the overall story, it does well in its exploration of relationships and what it means to be happy.
 "
First Blush,83,,critic,"
Writer-director Neumark doesn't fall into the titillation trap that most ""threesome"" movies do, making it all about the sex.
 "
First Blush,83,,critic,"
We should be satisfied with just the character interplay and drama between the sex, but the absence of these scenes weighs heavily on the story. Luckily, the cast absolutely sells it.
 "
First Blush,83,,critic,"
Neumark takes on the subject of the three-person relationship. Rather than turn it into an erotic thriller, he finds joy, complication, and humanity.

Earwig and the Witch,34,68,audience,Hopefully there's a sequel!
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,audience,Wow that was such a bad movie. So disappointing. Such a lack of rhythm. So many moments that feel graphically half baked.
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,audience,"The ending was incomplete. It was doing a good job building the world, and as the third act should have been beginning, the credits rolled."
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,audience,"The true heart of Ghibli's actual magic is only felt through the end credits, after a disappointing, insignificant. soullessly charming return with aimless storytelling despite familiar humorous amusement lightening things up occasionally, therefore sadly marking a new low. (C)"
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,audience,"Easily the worst movie from Studio Ghibli, how did we go from being awe-inspiring with films like ""Spirited Away"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", and ""When Marnie Was There"" to being a lame and boring movie like Earwig and the Witch, it was terrible, the story felt slow and dull(and worst of all, it ends suddenly when something good was going to save this movie), the CGI animation was highly mediocre(and could had been better off as a traditionally animated feature), and the characters so bland that you won't remember them at all"
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,audience,"It isn't a blockbuster, but it also wasn't lackluster. Goro isn't Hayao, and never will be, but I still think he's still an exceptional director."
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,audience,"Look. I know Ghibli is trying to start a new generation... But this movie was NOT a great beginning to the new chapter. Why? The story was bland, confusing,  and nonetheless awful. The plot made barely any sense. The main character was annoying. Bratty and a little bit of a fucking phsycho. I think the problem with this film is that the story is dry, annoying, and tasteless. I think the character designs were pretty great! I loved The demon guy and Thomas. They were the only things that I liked from the movie, but even then those characters were still annoying. Unfortunately, the style of Ghibli we are used to has not translated in this movie either. Some parts feel like you're in a wierd video game. The expressions feel like I'm watching a crazy sims...idk. this movie was just absolutely insane to watch. I won't stop you from watching it though"
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,audience,"This movie was so much fun and NEW. Bravo and thank you to Goro and team at Studio Ghibli for this new film. Regardless of the other critics poor taste, I am beyond pleased. The story was easy to follow and pretty uncomplicated. Honestly, I really relate to the story as a whole and hope to see more!"
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,audience,It's not the next My Neighbor Totoro by a mile but it's a decent little movie. Kids should like it well enough. Just be aware it doesn't have a lot going on in regards to a plot and there's no deeper message here. Go into it with a big tub of popcorn and have a nice time.
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,audience,"Earwig, later named Erica, is dropped off at an orphanage, and grows up enjoying controlling people. One day, Erica is adopted by Bella Yaga and Mandrake. She becomes a witch's assistant, but it is boring and she can't control them. Erica discovers music named ""Earwig"". She ends the movie figuring out how to charm and control Bella Yaga and Mandrake, and getting everything she wants.

This is not only a bad movie, this is an offensively bad movie. I can't describe how deeply psychopathic the main character, Erica comes off, as it seems like her only goal in life is to control people. All the life, joy, beauty of a Ghibli film has been sucked out to leave a hollow, empty, plastic CG film. The visuals are ugly. The story is ugly."
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
The very thing that makes it novel, the change in format, also proves to be a drawback for viewers who are familiar with Studio Ghibli's body of work...it's a good thing, then that the younger Miyazaki is not aiming for realism...
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
An empty product that has all the ingredients of a successful Ghibli film with seemingly no idea how to put them together.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
The story follows a young girl and how she learns to exercise her sense of agency in new surroundings.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
The film marks a new chapter for Studio Ghibli that opens it up to innovation as a new decade begins, and after watching Earwig and the Witch, fans of the studio will be eager for whatever projects come next.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
Book-based CGI fantasy has scares, lacks spark.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
The smooth, glossy animation couldn't sum up movie better, appearing as generic as almost everything in this slight, bright, likeable but rarely memorable addition to Studio Ghibli's filmography.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
A Roald Dahl-esque tale of a little girl and suburban witchcraft. Charming enough but it never really takes off.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
Earwig and the Witch is a faithful adaptation but a mediocre Studio Ghibli film. And given the studio's outstanding record, a weak Ghibli film seems all the more unfortunate.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
There's very little stakes and there's very little character goals, so it's hard to get invested in the story or the characters.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
Like other Ghibli films, Earwig and the Witch treats childhood in a more adult way than most children's animations, with the emphasis being on gentle manipulation rather than innocence.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
Fans should give this film a chance, if only to hear Richard E. Grant's voice work. It is a delightful variation on a theme of Alice in Wonderland/Tabitha the Teenage Witch.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
Earwig and the Witch is, by normal standards, a misfire-and by Ghibli's standards it's much worse.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
The worst Studio Ghibli production by such a gargantuan margin that the only fun lies in trying to come up with sufficiently florid insults to describe it.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
Earwig and the Witch aims to continue [Studio Ghibli's] tradition, but while it gets close, it feels unfinished.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
Even if far from being top-tier Ghibli, it's not without its fantastical pleasures.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
They're not just hopping to a new platform. They're hopping to a new platform and they have to find their own look in that new platform, and they haven't yet.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
If Ghibli wanted to make their own mockbuster, then they pulled it off.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
Without much argument the weakest Ghibli production ever released.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
It all just feels like something that nobody would particularly warm to.
 "
Earwig and the Witch,34,68,critic,"
Earwig and the Witch is a decent movie, and a prime example of style over substance. The music, the characters, and the aesthetic come together to outweigh the lukewarm animation and thin narrative.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
...I can't deny being lured in by Vassilopoulos' richly colored aesthetic of Superior. With a stronger script, her vision and visual palette could take her very far.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Predictable but pungent psychodrama that is mildly diverting.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Superior feels like Diet David Lynch: an unsatisfying substitute.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Good storytelling and fantastic acting by Alessandra and Anamari Mesa make up for any limitations of not having budget presents. Superior is worthy of your support.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
A film with so much potential, but it collapses in on itself to become repetitive as it loses its thread on talking about trauma, identity, and what it means to be free.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
The film suggests what might have resulted if Brian De Palma had directed Desperately Seeking Susan, and while it takes a while to get going, it does hit a nice grove during the middle section, thanks in large part to the charm of the twin Mesas.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Vassilopoulos has a keen sense of pacing, switching from the comedic to the frightening with expert timing.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Superior is certainly attractive to look at and features a couple solid performances. There's just nothing here that really warranted this ever being more than the short it originated as.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Captures the aesthetics of the early 80s noir thriller with a low budget, retro feel that provides a callback to films of the era.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
The 80s retro production design pairs nicely with the decision to shoot in 16mm... But the glacial pacing prevents Superior from building momentum, and the climax feels flat and uninspired.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Our twin heroines may be reunited and more bonded than ever by the end, but Superior doesn't do a particularly effective job at making us care.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
While [its] intention sucks you in, the story leaves you floundering.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Erin Vassilopoulos' delightfully retro ""Superior"" works in that it provides a great vehicle for real life twins Alessandra and Ani Mes, but stumbles with thin plotting and uneven narrative foundations.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
It's about blurred lines, collapsing identities and merging subjectivities, but the sly, slick little ""Superior"" knows just who it is.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Superior is a film about escapism, focusing on two women who want nothing more than to be someone else, because being in someone else's shoes means forgetting about your own problems, even if just for a moment.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Ultimately, Superior is a slow-burn that ventures outside of the norm when it comes to the conundrum of identity, often blurring the lines between one twin and the other as the film goes on.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
The film as a whole is more driven by mood and character than it is by plot, which deteriorates into near-indifferent banality well before the final frame.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Engaging performances from the Mesa sisters and retro-inspired production design - for a film whose time period is unplaceable - can't quite save the transparency of the plot.
 "
Superior,53,,critic,"
Superior is a sumptuous, moody psycho-drama that should be a loud coming-out party for its twin leads Alessandra and Ani Mesa.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Led by the astounding performances of its cast, Mass is a powerful and heartbreaking drama that examines the emotional toll of one of the main social issues in the United States. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
An emotionally gripping movie that explores grief as a result of a mass shooting. A thought-provoking premise that shines a light on individuals who don't normally get any consideration in this situation. An unforgettable movie.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Taking two pairs of seasoned stage and film actors and putting them in a room for two hours to hash out a shared trauma sounds like the making of a great Tennessee Williams play, but it is instead a riveting and unforgettable feature by Fran Kranz.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Mass is an acting showcase. The quartet of performances from Jason Isaac, Martha Plimpton, Reed Birney and Ann Dowd are flawless.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Mass leaves plenty of breathing room for characters to have authentic moments of emotion and puts a gentle, grace-filled frame around an almost unspeakable tragedy. It's a showcase for its performers, but it's also a valuable experience for its audience.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
It's tragic, it's unforgettable, Mass is a must-see. Flourishing under its intimate telling; very rarely will something affect you as much as this film does.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Mass is far from an easy film to watch, but the emotional journey that it takes you through is one that is both important and emotionally gratifying.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
This is such a cagey, engrossing way to start a story.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
A complex and emotional one room drama [...] about guilt, mental health, grief, and parenting.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Kranz's feature debut is outstanding. Full of heart, honesty and naked vulnerability, you could tell that he was just as invested in this project as the awe-inspiring actors.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Mass is a movie that will linger in people's memories long after they watch it. And it will be a story that will come to mind when people think about how mass murders cause untold traumas that don't necessarily make headlines.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
A chamber piece that feels a little too stagey
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Mass is what indie cinema should be: Incisive, contemplative, questioning, and thought-provoking
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Insufferably impressed with its own cleverness, right down to the dumb double entendre title.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
All four main actors fully engaged in their roles because the material existed for them to do so.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
It is smartly-written, handsomely-lensed, and gorgeously acted, but I think it lacks some of the punch that it would have had on the stage.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
The film avoids leaning into sensationalism, and though it's emotionally wrenching, there's something comforting to the process of mourning that both couples are going through as they wrestle with the political implications of a very personal event.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Unsurprisingly, Kranz has an actorly sense of conflict and explication, but, despite the limited setting, he gives his actors plenty of room with which to work, and the quartet are more than up to the task.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
Gripping and sincerely moving from first to last, Mass is exceptional filmmaking all-round from Kranz and a stellar showcase for the talents of Plimpton, Isaacs, Dowd and Birney.
 "
Mass,93,,critic,"
a gripping drama

Passing,85,,critic,"
A quiet and enigmatic drama that examines social themes and issues in the United States through the lens of a complex friendship. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Gorgeously shot in exquisite black and white cinematography. It's tough to believe this is a directorial debut. Memorable performances from Thompson and Negga, this is a must-watch.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
An absolutely absorbing, beautiful and timely work of art sure to turn heads at any awards ceremony with good taste in film.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
It all leads to a shocking and devastating conclusion but with gentle compassion, Hall captures the isolation, admiration, and quiet desperation between the women in a sophisticated story that still resonates nearly a century after it was first told.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
If you don't expect the film to do any heavy lifting on race analysis, Passing is a solid directorial debut by Rebecca Hall, who recently made a discovery about her own heritage.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Passing rewards the patient with a gorgeous, psychologically-loaded exploration of the tension between have and have-not.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Passing successfully juggles its many complex themes with pointed dialogue and amazing performances.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Despite the flaws, you can feel the blood, sweat and tears that Hall and the actors have poured into this and while uneven, it is an ambitious debut that mostly achieves what it sets out to do.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Hall is wrestling with her own biracial heritage, too, and frames the shattering story of Clare and Irene with elegance and empathy.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
As Hall stated in her Sundance introduction, it's a black and white film about how everything is not so black and white in its discussions of race, as well as class, sexuality, motherhood, and the restrictive nature of binaries in general.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Rebecca Hill's prim, delicately devastating look at light-skinned African-Americans in 1920s Harlem...
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
The film feels almost dreamlike, evoking a world in which the lines that separate friendship from desire, love from hate, and white from Black are more permeable than you might expect - a world a lot like today's.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Rebecca Hall fully and boldly commits to a dreamy black and white aesthetic in her directorial debut, which has all the quiet forcefulness of a storm about to break.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
There's a vacuum at the heart of ""Passing"" that not even Eduard Grau's uncommonly gorgeous black-and-white cinematography can fill.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Passing is among the most major films that came out of this year's Sundance with its incisive lens focused on a gray area of racial identity rarely spelled out in contemporary cinema.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Passing is a film that is successful in examining identity and the decisions we make.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
It's a ballsy first film, a black and white melodrama that relies more on the hidden truths of its characters than any kind of formal plot. The motives of every character in this film can be questioned.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Emotionally rich and incredibly nuanced performances by Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga anchor Passing, a moody and mesmerizing film...
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
Passing is a great debut for its director, with two fantastic performances at its that are only made better - and sadder -- by how great its visuals are, though that never overwhelms its thematic beauty.
 "
Passing,85,,critic,"
The premise is so repugnant, audiences may flinch at the prospect of watching a social/racial malady that should have never existed. If they do, they will miss an impeccable recreation of the Harlem Renaissance era -- warts and all.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
Lister-Jones and Spaeny...but How It Ends is ultimately brought down by its interminable celebrity cameos.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
Brimming with cheerful, absurd humor.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
It's a film brimming with sweet sadness as well as a nagging restlessness that, in 2021, is all too familiar.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
This is a movie that knows which has the bigger personal impact: that asteroid in the sky, or someone telling you something you've always longed to hear.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
Strangely, though How It Ends is, without question, despairing in its use of a world-ending event ... resulting in a tale that's completely optimistic in the face of unavoidable doom.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
Each performance is vulnerable, sweet, and funny on its own, but together, they're simply magic-like two sisters who know each other so well it's hard to tell them apart.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
The film's strained attempt at hilarity out of a hopeless situation becomes so tiresome, you can't help but shrug at some of its myopic insights and sunny nihilism.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
It is neither funny nor moving as it trades in both prototypical indie-comedy improvised riffing and pointless platitudes about self-affirmation.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
There are occasional laughs, as the film collects an impressive collection of talented and funny people. But overall, it rests on a gimmick that doesn't quite work.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
How it Ends is wonderfully random, genuinely funny, and yet beautifully poignant. A cathartic rumination on just what we want from ourselves when the end finally comes.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
Hats off to Zoe Lister-Jones and husband Daryl Wein for writing, directing, and completing a funny, off-beat film during the Covid pandemic.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
Seeped in classic Southern California sunshine, How It Ends doesn't require too much thought or even attention to be a comfortable watch.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
Although episodic in nature, the movie has a quirky, good-natured vibe, witty dialogue, and effective use of various L.A. neighborhoods.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
The eccentric vibe that won't appeal to everyone, but this sweetly unconventional film enchanted me with its kooky charms.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
Feeling much longer than its running time of 82 minutes, the film struggles to find its pace, often too preoccupied with offering a shiny display to big names instead of nurturing the plot -- one that ultimately fails to sustain a feature.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
This is quirky comedic relief that doubles as a cathartic time capsule for this zany moment in history.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
Funny, scrappy, and breezy,How It Endsadmittedly doesn't always work. But when it does, it works like a charm.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
The performances are flat, the script is sorely lacking in any kind of tension or stakes (ironic, considering it's the end of the world), the jokes aren't funny, and the dramatic moments feel manufactured.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
A film of joyful nihilism, one that accepts that when nothing really matters anymore, perhaps what's most important is finding ways to be happy with whatever you've got.
 "
How It Ends,69,,critic,"
Not all the comedic bits land, but How It Ends is how movies should be produced right now.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,audience,"So, this is definitely not your typical horror movie (I kind of understand the mixed feelings it's having).

I may even say it's more of a drama, a tragedy, a deep and dark character study of a young woman that's going through a crisis, triggered by loneliness, sustained by her religious calling, reaching the point of not distinguishing the real from what was happening in her head. Morfydd Clark delivers a delusional and unhinged performance, giving us some unsettling, eerie on-screen moments that will stay in my mind for a while, not to mention the outstanding haunting score and some fun, creative cinematography.

It's exciting to see how horror has been evolving through directors as Rose Glass, with that unique, disturbing vision and style."
Saint Maud,93,66,audience,"I wanted to love this movie so badly. The trailer made it look so exceptional. The structure is too montage-y, the scenes don't really lead to nothing it's just a series of beautiful imagery and cinematography. Some people will understand what she's going through, because not everything can be explained when you're going through certain stuff but a little bit more back story would've helped connect with the story. It's not as good as I expected it to be. I loved the ending though. It Showed how lonely, depressed and mentally unwell she is. I especially love how new filmmakers depict mental illness in they movies."
Saint Maud,93,66,audience,"Workmanlike character study, which felt somewhat two-dimensional."
Saint Maud,93,66,audience,"It's difficult to give Saint Maud an unflattering review as the film itself is technically and narratively really well done. The tone delivers it's intended effect, the story is original, the acting is intensely realistic and award worthy, and the feeling of the piece stays with you days after the credits roll. So why the low review? I'll preface my opinion by stating that I'm aware that this is very much based on my own view of the world. My lack of enthusiasm to enjoy this film is because it explores its themes using the bleakest, most unforgiving, no lessons learned, suffering for its own sake, type of tone. Even the darkest moments in our real life pain, loneliness and torment have moments of reprieve, relief, joy and comedy; none of which are to be found in Saint Maud. It felt like diving into shades of black from the onset and, tonally speaking, did present one-note in this way. We know life can be dark and hard sometimes but it ain't all that bad, however this film disconnects itself from that reality and delves into the darkness and consequences of unchecked mental illness, trauma and misplaced hope with an unapologetic mercilessness. Also (I'm not religious in any way so I'm not personally offended by this) but this film had a heavy anti-religious message which I feel is unkind and unfair to people of faith. I question if filmmakers (myself included) take the time to ask themselves, ""Even though I'm capable of making a fiercely powerful and technical masterpiece of a film that I know the critics will love, is the MESSAGE that I'm releasing into the world something that people can use to help improve their lives and their outlook? Am I actually helping humanity and improving the world or am I simply exploring pain because my art is therapy for my own demons? Do I want to be an artist delivering a message of hope or despair and why?"" There is enough pain and suffering in the world already, why add fuel to the fire?"
Saint Maud,93,66,audience,Best horror film from the 2019-2020. A subtle yet terrifying experience and a clever blind faith critique and the horrors that come from loneliness.
Saint Maud,93,66,audience,"A couple of scenes were definitely worthwhile and kind of gets in in the realm of horror genre, but overall this film felt very contrived - lacking any genuine message and using the religious zealot theme for sensationalistic shock value. It's bleak and purposelessly depressing due to lack of any redeeming qualities in the protagonist, whose inner turmoil is not explored, but just put on display like in a freak-show."
Saint Maud,93,66,audience,"A bleak, short, attention holding watch centered on an excellent lead performance. It suffered because I was really never in any doubt how it was going to end."
Saint Maud,93,66,audience,"One of the best films i've seen this year, very original with good acting. Both photography and music are great."
Saint Maud,93,66,audience,"Predictable, lacking in any chills or moments of shock and just incredibly ho-hum."
Saint Maud,93,66,audience,This movie was not horror. Not in the slightest. The only interesting part of this movie is the actress that to me looked like Meryl Streep. This movie fortunately was short and only wasted an hour and twenty minutes of my life. It was an artsy film school wanna be something more than it was. It was very cliche and uninspiring.
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
It's very well directed, the strangely melancholic milieu is rich, and the script is bold, taking on religious belief as a kind of self-destructive mania.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
Saint Maud is a movie that you will either absolutely love or hate. There is no in-between for this horror tinged exploration of mental illness and faith.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
This is the kind of daring feature debut that makes you immediately take note of the director. After Saint Maud, I'll watch anything that Rose Glass makes. The film is that good
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
For those who seek out an atmospheric, measured contemplation on loneliness and a look into a splintered mind as it begins to break will find much to contemplate.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
Glass has talent and sensitivity, but a lot of potential drama in the material just slips through her fingers.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
[An] eerie exploration of the madness that can result from religious fervor...
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
It is difficult to believe Saint Maud is a first feature for director Rose Glass. She seems to be one of those filmmakers who arrives on the scene fully formed, with a deep, dark, intimate style, and a fearlessness about playing with genre.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
It's hysteria-inspiring, pulse-pounding, gut-wrenching psychological horror grounded by an extraordinary effort from both Mofrydd Clark and Rose Glass, whose harmonious work makes Saint Maud a knockout debut.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
The terrors that Glass' film forces us to confront are instead of the psychological variety, and couldn't be more timely in an era half-obsessed with group-think misinformation and rising belief in outrageous conspiracy theories.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
Haunting, stylish, disturbing, thought-provoking, and mysteriously ambiguous, though it provides a lot of the answers to those who are paying close attention.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
Saint Maud is something you won't likely forget for a long time.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
Saint Maud is horror for the adventurous soul because it challenges you. And make sure you don't blink at the end because the final image is a gut punch that proves how bold and original Glass is as a filmmaker.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
A pointless, exhausting exercise in delusion and cruelty, elevated by a few striking images that falsely inflate its worth.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
Religion gone amok. A good, well-directed psychological horror film which gets under your skin with its creepy scenarios.

Fans of elevated horror, your prayers have finally been answered!
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
There are not many boo moments, although the few Glass pulls off are decent jump-inducers. What works is the superficial sense of atmosphere, made palpable by good actors. But looks can only go so far.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
Saint Maud might be too slow for those who prefer their horror on the fast-burn side, but others will be rewarded for their patience as the film builds a growing sense of dread.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
Glass creates a constant unease from Maud's degradation without exploiting the character's pains in the process.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
A moody and atmospheric build to one of the most memorable and chilling final shots you'll ever see in a horror film.
 "
Saint Maud,93,66,critic,"
By making the film a scary, intense and thought-provoking experience all in one, Glass showcases how much can be done when horror isn't limited to jump scares and mindless gore.

Finding 'Ohana,83,85,audience,"From the city center return to the roots through adventure. What they will gain in the end is treasure, but not gold. It is love, a return to the cult of family and happiness that overflows through emotions.

For children, teenagers, families, a great film with a strong message that happiness can be experienced in different ways."
Finding 'Ohana,83,85,audience,"Predictably and slow pacing are the only aspects holding back this movie from a perfect score. This film took a cliché plot and re-imagined it in a way that all ages can appreciate. There was ever a moment in this movie in which I felt bored or uninterested. Perhaps one of Netflix's better movies as of 2021, I would recommend this movie to anyone seeking an entertaining adventure film they can watch with their entire family."
Finding 'Ohana,83,85,audience,Its a crap knock off of the goonies.
Finding 'Ohana,83,85,audience,"Finding 'Ohana is the best adult movie for kids since 'Goonies' and it's got an Easter egg for fans of the 80s Cult Classic that you may not even know til after you look up a character or two.  Christina Strain's screenplay is magically brought to life by Jude Weng, both of whom are partaking in their first feature in their capacity.  It may have some familiar tones, but it's distinctly Hawaiian and lots of fun.  It's a film you can show to your family and everyone will be happy.  It's a little long at over two hours, but it flies by with just enough action and a flashback gimmick that works.  There's something for everyone, so if you have Netflix check it out. Final Score: 8.8/10"
Finding 'Ohana,83,85,audience,"Very action packed, felt like I was part of the movie. Very nice message. Hawiian culture, has great influence."
Finding 'Ohana,83,85,audience,Slow moving and very predictable! 1/2 star was for the actors (they worked hard to give the story a life) and few pieces of actual scenery. The treasure hunt was Soooooo boring!
Finding 'Ohana,83,85,audience,"Ohana means family. A Hawaiian family living in Brooklyn returned to Hawaii, went on a treasure hunt, and reconnect with their Hawaiian heritage. 

Now I'm aware that the movie aims toward family and kids, but I just could not like this movie. The acting was pretty bad, especially the main kid. I felt like she tried too hard to be edgy. The dialogues and jokes were mostly cringe and cheesy. When the characters retold the lore, the movie used the Ant-man lip syncing. Now in Ant-Man, Michael Pena was great the lip syncing worked very well. However, the lip syncing was quite bad and unfunny in this movie. 

The theme of movie was about reconnecting with one's heritage. I really liked the theme, but I don't think the story delivered and emphasized the theme enough. I don't feel connected enough to these characters to appreciate their change at the end, even though the change was pretty obvious. 

I still liked some part of the movie, particularly the interesting Hawaiian lore and culture. The adventure these kids went on was pretty decent.

Overall, not my movie and the theme and story doesn't work. 3.5/10"
Finding 'Ohana,83,85,audience,"My all time favorite movie, GOONIES. Liked this spin off and casting of Jonathan Ke Quan. Relatable, great movie to watch with the family and wonderful teaching points (sibling rivalry, honor, pain, and reconciliation). Great looking cast and beautiful scenery! A movie that leaves you wishing more movies were like this one!!"

Notturno,81,,audience,"More of a Frederick Wiseman documentary than anything else, your enjoyment of Notturno will invariably come down to one thing.  Do you have empathy for people from foreign lands who may not be the same color as you?  Choose Wisely.  Final Score: 8/10"
Notturno,81,,critic,"
Ultimately it's an ambitious view of war and places we don't often see; where seemingly nothing is happening and yet so much is swirling beneath the surface - or just out of frame.
 "

Rosi's method of patient observation allows him to make poetic connections across borders...

Nobody with a sense for contemplative cinema will be left unsatisfied by Notturno.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
It's about the steps towards healing, challenging Western viewers to allow images of beauty and normalcy to play a part in that journey.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
It's an intensely considered curation of scenes: glimpses, perhaps, into a collective mind or soul.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
You may feel unease at the perfect tableaux of grief-broken mothers in the abandoned cells of their dead sons. Fortunately Rosi is not without self-awareness.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
Rosi has stripped his film of all documentary conventions. There are no voice-overs, no talking heads or experts. The result leaves space for the viewer's own emotional reaction to the lives of the survivors.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
Beautifully shot, deeply moving photo journalism and a potent movie about living in a region ravaged by war and terrorism.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
Notturno builds some empathy, but only of a vague, fleeting variety. That might be enough for winning cinematic awards and pleasing the festival circuit. But...
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
An egrossing experience that bears witness as few other works have done to the most innocent victims of war.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
Notturno is not the type of movie that has mass appeal because of the often-disturbing subject matter and because it's not a typical war documentary ... Notturno conveys ... the resilience of the people in these war-torn areas.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
This impressionistic nonfiction survey shot over three years' course captures life amongst those fleeing civil wars, ISIS, foreign invasions and more, in the borderlands between Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Kurdistan.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
Shot over three years in Syria, Kurdistan, Iraq and Lebanon, this masterful documentary by the gifted Gianfranco Rosi immediately reminds us of the intensely personal stories behind headlines about war.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
The overall effect is like picking up a copy of National Geographic, turning to a long and ambitious photo essay, and not reading the captions. It also shows the limits of what Rosi can achieve.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
While Notturno shares many moments of profound fragility and deep beauty, it also paints an incomplete portrait.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
The content of Rosi's documentary ... is indispensable ... The absence of vital context, though, hinders the movie's potential power.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
It may all depend on the totality of your reactions, though, and whether you feel ""Notturno""- in the panoply of Rosi's specialized, confident hybridizing of intimacy and distance - is a cooler gaze or something emotionally resonant.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
Rosi endlessly proves that he can turn the region's agony into the finest art, and proves enough that he hasn't lost sight of the human factor in the process.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
Offsetting the harsh truths on the ground with strikingly composed shots ... Rosi creates a somber meditation on brutality and resilience.
 "
Notturno,81,,critic,"
Notturno is sometimes beautiful and Rosi makes good use of private spaces, but it comes off as an exploitation of the region and its people's pain.

No Man's Land,34,81,audience,This movie is trash. It does a terrible job of addressing issues at the border between land owners and illegal immigrants who trespass on their property. So many things in this movie just don't make any sense and would never happen that way.
No Man's Land,34,81,audience,"While it covers a timely topic, it lacks nuance and feels contrived, as if told from a privileged perspective that could not possibly understand."
No Man's Land,34,81,audience,"I believe it covers more than justice, redemption, understanding; it fulfills your soul with values such as family, be someone else from a different perspective.
Cast and Frank Grillo are amazing."
No Man's Land,34,81,audience,"I loved the movie! It was so well written and such a moving story. The actors were great as well. Jake Allyn did a great job of portraying a young man affected by conflict at the border, and Frank Grillo never disappoints. I love that westerns are becoming popular again. I would love to see a sequel."
No Man's Land,34,81,audience,Loved it times a million!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No Man's Land,34,81,audience,"Not realistic and condescending toward Mexican people. Texans rely on Mexicans to break wild horses, not the other way around. Virtually all Anglo landowners in the Rio Grande Valley where this is supposed to take place speak Spanish very well or fluently. Hero of story knows as little Spanish as someone from Maine."
No Man's Land,34,81,audience,"Felt like a college film project or a hobby film by someone wealthy enough to leave their day job and take a detour into film making. Manufactured unrealistic and irrational situations in an attempt to make its audience feel desperation and vulnerability. But instead of being hooked by those emotions at key points (as you normally would in a good thriller or action), you are pushed away by the dullness and unlikely foundations used to trigger such emotions. I found myself wanting to turn this off in the early stages of the movie and move on to something else but there was enough there to ""give it 15 more minutes"". You end up watching the rest of the movie with this feeling until it finally ends in a predictable and unremarkable manner. While there are real issues at the Texas-Mexico border, for the ranchers who live there and for those in Mexico wanting to cross, the creators of this film didn't strike me as having enough experience with the border or ranching to really hit the bulls eye here (small example - a ranch kid would never drink from the Rio Grande River or be bothered by cactus. There are so many examples like this but will not spoil the more meaningful contradictions). In any event, there were many contradictions like this that unintentionally undermined the character's role,  preventing you from being hooked. There is substantial movie worthy plots at the border, but like a tumbleweed, this one blows with the wind."
No Man's Land,34,81,audience,"I think the movie is genuine. Shows the struggle between two sides where the difference in right and wrong is drawn in the sand and/or a border. And throughout the entire film you're questioning, ""Where do I stand?"""

No Man's Land,34,81,critic,"
No Man's Land is tone-deaf schlock that actually has more than a whiff of white supremacy and racist beliefs. The film's Mexican characters are written as expendable ... while the white characters are elevated as having more valuable lives.

The rest of the movie plays out as you guess it might, but the quality of the acting is good enough to mostly make up for the script's lack of subtlety.
 "
No Man's Land,34,81,critic,"
The filmmakers are obviously hoping that their story works to expose contemporary racial injustice, making it a timely update of well-worn Western themes. But the slowly paced ""No Man's Land"" doesn't quite live up to that promise.
 "
No Man's Land,34,81,critic,"
... nicely balances the perspectives of the two families without drawing clear-cut heroes and villains, but much of the authenticity becomes muddled by convoluted plotting and Western cliches.
 "
No Man's Land,34,81,critic,"
Most of the performances are pretty good and the film certainly has its heart in the right place, but No Man's Land just goes on too long without having anything fresh or insightful to say.
 "
No Man's Land,34,81,critic,"
No Man's Land is a well-meaning, but inherently flawed western drama. Its goals are admirable, but the narrative succumbs to contrivances and simplistic exposition.
 "
No Man's Land,34,81,critic,"
""No Man's Land"" message of unity gets bogged down by lazy plot mechanics, including a half-minded redemption narrative that never takes off and cartoonish protagonists too illogical for audiences to take seriously.
 "
No Man's Land,34,81,critic,"
For a movie that's about a character on the run, No Man's Land meanders and takes its time in a way that feels conflicting with the narrative.
 "

I feel like No Man's Land gets far more right than it does wrong.

Brothers by Blood is about the traits we inherit from our parents, our loyalties and debts, and the difference between the two. Beneath it all, a sad lyricism permeates the proceedings.

It's hard to say that any other edit would be better, because Brothers by Blood is one single, grey mass to the bone, an unfortunate use of a sterling cast and a book that deserves a more textured retelling.

The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,42,62,audience,"""The Ultimate Playlist of Noise"" is a well-intentioned and heartfelt movie. I enjoyed the main story and felt empathy for the main character. The issue with the movie is that there are countless movies that are similar to this one and also significantly better. I don't think this movie is bad, but it has many cliche moments that kept it from feeling truly inventive. I think people who like these sort of tear-jerking movies, like myself sometimes admittedly, will at least like this movie. I just personally can think of at least a handful of movies that are more engaging and memorable. Nonetheless, this movie has a good central message and an interesting enough premise that I liked watching one time."
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,42,62,audience,Really enjoyed this movie.
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,42,62,audience,I truly loved this movie!!!!!
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,42,62,audience,"I am 19 minutes into this movie and CANNOT get past the horrendous acting! This young man playing the lead can't act his way out of a paper sack. Some people have it and some don't. This kid needs a new career path. The two friends are not believable characters. Awful writing, awful acting, serious plot holes in the writing... and highly questionable directing, especially when it comes to the relationships & interactions between the characters . I'm going to try to make myself keep watching just to be fair and to see if the plot or writing improves. I don't have a habit of pausing a movie in order to vent about the horrendous acting, but ""The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,"" earned that privilege. Yikes!"
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,42,62,audience,"It was alright. I found the friends (specifically Laura) were really annoying and unrelatable. The were rude and didn't seem like they even really liked him. It was like they were trying to be funny but the jokes felt like they were trying too hard to be different. They only have a small role but I still found them prominently annoying. Anyways, the character of Wendy didn't seem like a real person in that she didn't act like people would act in certain situations. Other than that the sound design was good and Marcus was a good main character."
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,42,62,audience,This film makes you appreciate the small things in life
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,42,62,audience,4 out of 5 stars. It is a strong emotional journey about a coming of age story when a young teen has a seizure. To only find out he has a tumor. It can be removed in his brain but it will have complications that will take away his hearing. He decides to plan a road trip and make a playlist of sounds along the way. Which he runs into Wendy (Madeline Brewer) which she is also on the run to new york. They both go together. Making memories and recording sounds. The plot is good. Cute and emotional. Keean Johnson and Madeline Brewer did a fantastic job with there characters. The idea of losing hearing is tough. The noises of music. Nature. Voices and so much more taken away can be scary. The movie does not into that teen romance cliche. Which is a good thing. But the chemistry of the two characters is sweet and perfecr when they are on screen. Great cast. Fun direction and music score. The plot is good with an emotional characterization. It is definitely worth checking out.
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,42,62,audience,"Events and scenes skip clumsily like a scratched CD, but The Ultimate Playlist of Noise, to its credit, is an overall genuine teen story with a fairly strong ending, especially given the clunky setup job."
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,42,62,audience,"The Ultimate Playlist of Noise is your standard YA film, for better or worse. Keean Johnson was pretty solid, as was Madeline Brewer. They made a good duo. The story had some pretty nice moments. But I do think this film didn’t do anything particularly memorable. As I write this review I struggle to think of anything that really stood out. There were moments that worked, but there were others that were just cliched filled. I do think that this being released so close to Sound of Metal didn’t really do this any favors. Overall, there was just very average. While there are plenty of worse young adult films out there, there are plenty of better ones as well. "
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise,42,62,audience,"While it does very much rely on the stereotypical coming-of-age formula, the film gives enough heart to be somewhat enjoyable throughout while also adding much needed depth to the likable main characters. The emotional aspect could have been improved upon as this film was not nearly as ""tear jerking"" as other teen dramas from the past few years. With a complex story that keeps you invested, this film does its job. Nothing more, nothing less."

One Night in Miami,98,82,audience,"The film follows a historical One Night in Miami when Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali, Sam Cooke, and Jim Brown crossed paths 🏠  , However, take note that the conversations that play out on screen are all fictional and the work of screenwriter Kemp Powers ✍🏾  The film is driven by the amazing ensemble cast. They have great chemistry and work through conflict after conflict as a result of differing philosophical beliefs. Although directed well, the film is largely uneventful as the majority of the film is shot inside the hotel floor. When there are cutaways to flashbacks and a change in location, it is a breath of fresh air and lingers in one's mind 🎬  The message of the film of using one's voice to fight for equality is memorable, timeless, and thought-provoking. Not the best film of the year. But still definitely worth a watch 💯"
One Night in Miami,98,82,audience,"Great movie . Greats performances of Malcolm X , Muhammad AlI, Jim Brown and Sam Cooke all talk about things that r still relevant still to this day."
One Night in Miami,98,82,audience,"While it took me a while to fully jump on board with the rhetorical storytelling, I ended up enjoying it, thanks to the intoxicating performances, slowly building up a powerful script.

I must admit I would've liked more soul and spice in the back, everything is just so clean. Even though the speech and the message are both interesting and important, there comes a time when you just want to see something different besides these guys discussing for almost two hours.

A nice, well-accomplished debut of Regina King as a director, I must say."
One Night in Miami,98,82,audience,"For a play turned to a movie it really holds your attention. Acting is excellent. Definitely worth watching. And you learn things, especially in the light of todays world."
One Night in Miami,98,82,audience,For a debut film for Regina King just another unenthralling cartoon dialog. Written by Kemp Powers imaginary historical nonsense.  It really looks like the critics felt compelled to rate the movie so high due to the nature of this type of film.
One Night in Miami,98,82,audience,"The problem with this movie is that none of it actually happened. It's presented as historical, but it's not. They literally just put words into these historical figure's mouths. How is that ok? The only thing that's true about this movie is that these men all stayed at the same hotel."
One Night in Miami,98,82,audience,This was the soundtrack of my youth. Amazingly well-done!
One Night in Miami,98,82,audience,"In a year of incredible films with the most deft of touches, one night can be added. Incredible acting, solid script, haunting delivery and a direction from Regina King, one night shows all the possible sides of the coin, as you would say."
One Night in Miami,98,82,audience,Historically inaccurate....I don't mean the night never occurred (it clearly didn't) but the facts surrounding the characters and almost everything about them is fantasized.  The acting is forced.  The message is beyond preachy.  If it wasn't for the PC culture of today it would be seriously panned.
One Night in Miami,98,82,audience,"This was a very interesting watch for me. Knowing full well who Malcolm X, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke, and Muhammad Ali are, learning that they were all in a room together one night with some eye-opening, sentimental truths being spewed, I couldn't help but feel the need to watch. Before I dive into this review, I'd just like to say that my takeaway from this film was that the point of it was to deliver some hard-hitting messages and showcase very fine performances for every figure being portrayed. Watching it from that lens nearly makes it a masterpiece, but as a whole, I don't quite think it lived up to the material at hand. 

Although I'm aware that the film One Night in Miami… is technically a fictional take on this particular night, I guarantee there were some insightful conversations before penning the screenplay. On the night that Muhammad Ali became the world champion, a series of events and conversations lead the four of these icons to the same hotel room. What worked so well about this film was the fact that they all had the same ideals about civil rights and the only reason any friction between them was caused, was due to how devoted they were to the laws around them. The dialogue each one of these actors has toward one another was very moving and is easily the glue that kept my eyes from leaving the screen.

It's very hard to make an argument on who gives the best performance here between Eli Goree, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Aldis Hodge, and Leslie Odom Jr.. They are all incredibly gifted actors and their talents are all on full display here, playing off each other as if they are veterans of the game. I was in awe every time any of them would speak a word to each other. If for nothing else, this film serves as a showcase of talent. Luckily, these performances only elevated the film as a whole. 

Taking place in the 1960s, the cultural issues happening around these characters is what the overall film is based around. That's at least how I viewed it. Each of their varying views on different subjects all leads to a final conversation in this hotel room that I felt moved by. However, I also felt that the film took a little too long to get to the final point it was trying to make. The impact the messages of the movie had overall were terrific, but I felt certain details could've been explored a little further and the run time could've been either tightened or more eventful, even given the one-location setting (for the most part). 

Working as a director throughout the years in television, Regina King has finally landed her talents in creating her first wide-release feature film. I think her direction here was fantastic and I think she is the type of person who can really bring out the best performances which whomever she is working with. It also didn't hurt that she had an awards-worthy screenplay to work with, written by Kemp Powers. Everything about this film was well-done, I just didn't think certain areas were explored enough. One Night in Miami… is now streaming on Prime Video and I absolutely recommend checking it out. I'm certain you'll be seeing it continue to be nominated for awards, deservedly so."

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,75,audience,Boseman si restul rup
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,75,audience,"Chadwick's performance is one of the few reasons you should watch this. It's electrifying. Sure Viola Davis shines too, but Chadwick already has the award in his bag. Besides the performances, the story follows a very theatrical path, that some will love, and many will hate. I thought I was going to see more of Ma Rainey's life (which I would've loved), instead of listening to discussions after discussions, and then more discussions between the characters, even though the message is still relevant. I stay with the performances, the rest is quite forgettable."
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,75,audience,"An interesting story with real interactions and a good blend of personalities. It has high high's and low lows. The ending came somewhat unexpected, as Levee's expectations are shattered as he falls victim to capitalism. Stellar performances all round."
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,75,audience,This is basically a play on the big screen. Lots of monologues. Great cast but overall the format didn't work for me as a movie.
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,75,audience,"In many ways, it's limited by its play source material. What works on stage is not always so interesting on the screen. However, the performances are truly a wonder and value to behold."
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,75,audience,loved it. Viola Davis was amazing. I really wanted to see her more on the screen. the late Chadwick Boseman was good too.
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,75,audience,"An interesting play on the black experience and for fans of the blues, it's not something I would normally watch as entertainment, but I made an exception for one of Chadwick Boseman's final films. I'd really only recommend this movie for it's performances, it is primarily carried by Viola Davis' exemplary performance as Ma Rainey, and a very charismatic Chadwick Boseman with some classic Coleman Davis on the side."
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,75,audience,"Chadwick Bosman was phenomenal in this (his last) film.  The rest of the cast was superb as well.  Ma's ""manager"" overacted in my opinion and lacked credibility.  The screenplay was ""vintage"" August Wilson - sad, melancholy, fast-paced and message-driven.  There should have been more complete renderings of some of the musical numbers."
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,75,audience,"August Wilson's 1982 play, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom , was one of ten-plays in the writer's ""Pittsburgh Cycle"" (Rainey being the only one of the ten not set in Pittsburgh) that chronicled the twentieth century African-American experience. Like most if not all of Wilson's writing Ma Rainey was meant to ""raise consciousness through theater"". Wilson's writing of the Black experience was something I first encountered my senior year of high school via Fences. As a Caucasian who attended a school with a student body that was more or less split right down the middle when it came to racial ratios the African American experience was something that was present without being particularly regarded as drastically different. Maybe it was simply my naïveté, but in my fifteen to eighteen year-old mind it was as simple as the fact that slavery, racism, and Martin Luther King had happened, what they had to deal with was wrong and terrible, but the actions they took had been worth it and upended those injustices for future generations. We as a society had grown past the ignorance of such things and while that statement in and of itself may now ring of more ignorance than ever I genuinely believe if one were to ask any of the Black kids I attended high school with that many would agree they felt the same way. Obviously, this isn't a diatribe against the need to highlight the many injustices that have been inflicted upon African Americans throughout the twentieth century and into present day, but rather a slice of insight into just how powerful, eye-opening, and - most importantly - how necessary literature documenting the Black experience is. This is all to say that director George C. Wolfe's interpretation of Wilson's material focuses largely on the theme of the burden Black people feel to do something with their time in order to ensure prosperity for future generations. The idea many of these individuals aren't allowed to lead a life where such issues don't impact their day to day drives certain characters present in Ma Rainey to purpose while pushing others to the edge. Wilson's exploration of contradiction in this American life through faith versus vindication or expectation versus the truth of the matter transforms the heated racial tension of 1920's Chicago into a pertinent commentary on how a system designed on the promise of possibility grants equal opportunities for repression; all of which is conveyed through the mood of the blues.

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,75,critic,"
The stories, an amalgam of the atrocities we've read about, bring you to tears. It's harsh, emotionally confrontational and still relevant today, unfortunately.

Godmothered,70,57,audience,"Not good. I don't hate it though, it's harmless and means well.

'Godmothered' is an extremely forgettable 2020 flick from Disney. Jillian Bell leads, with Isla Fisher supporting. I actually think it would've worked best the other way around, with Fisher portraying Eleanor and Bell playing Mackenzie. I like Bell from 'Workaholics', but she isn't lead worthy enough in my opinion; at least based on this. Jane Curtin also appears.

The plot is very formulaic and lacks originality, especially with a few cringey, ""how do you do fellow kids""-esque jokes. It's a very basic fish-out-of-water schtick for the majority. The ending is sickly, even if it has its heart fully in the right place."
Godmothered,70,57,audience,"More silly than charming, Godmothered lacks what Enchanted had."
Godmothered,70,57,audience,"You don't want to miss this one: it's really fun. The writing is smart (there are throw-away gag lines funnier than most comedies recently: listen for them!) and the premise is brilliant. I in fact had 2, count 'em, actual godmothers, who were indeed magical, and you should listen to my testimony about this film. What is the matter with these other grouchy reviewers?? Their pumpkins must be exploding. Don't listen to them, and don't miss the magic."
Godmothered,70,57,audience,"While obviously influenced by Enchanted a bit too much and the finale is overly expected, Godmothered is mostly a very charming, cozy and at times even magical Disney flick that also has a lot of heart. The humor is terrific, the VFX are quite solid and the performances from Isla Fisher and especially Jillian Bell are wonderful."
Godmothered,70,57,audience,"A boring version of Enchanted, just no singing. Confusing at times."
Godmothered,70,57,audience,"Very cute movie. I laughed outloud at quite a few parts. Touching and funny . Great for family time,  and a good Christmas movie. Worth the watch!"
Godmothered,70,57,audience,"Great movie! ... Could have been epic ... However, that just seems to be impossible these days. Not sure what it is but things just seem cheaper these days. This movie is very similar to Elf and Enchanted. Both of which are far superior to this movie, in comedy and magic. However, we've seen a lot of terrible movies this year, so with curved grading, this movie gets 5 stars."
Godmothered,70,57,audience,"While the whole ""Mystical Character Interacting with Modern Society"" premise has been done before in other, better movies, Godmothered has just enough creativity, laughs, and heart to make for a familiar but enjoyable family film with likable performances by Jillian Bell and Isla Fisher to boot!"
Godmothered,70,57,audience,Can’t believe this has a fresh score. The material is way beneath Jillian Bell’s talent. A truly awful film from an equally awful year. Disaster. 
Godmothered,70,57,audience,I actually thought this was funny and just simple but good. Not to childlike and theyre happens a lot in the movie but it works for me.

Wild Mountain Thyme,29,53,audience,It was rather boring
Wild Mountain Thyme,29,53,audience,"This is Swan Lake.

But I also can consider that it is more than just that. 

Everyone could be deemed societally crazy but we choose to hide behind other things just ""for show"". Rosemary walks on this divide with her longing for Antony and fling with Adam. She herself lives in a world she's created but has some sort of longing to experience the other side. There is pleasure in being considered normal by everyone else. Antony worries that something is wrong with his mind but he sees what most people do not, that we do not understand our own minds. They both live in sadness because they don't want to draw attention to themselves for being strange. But being strange is what we all are, or perhaps in this movie, the Irish. We see that truly, Antony and Rosemary are a perfect match because they can be themselves and accept each other for their true person. The ending of this movie is not at all a ‘crazy twist', but instead a representation of what it means to be human. The symbols in this movie, the tree, bee, swan, horse, etc., represent that when we are truly one with nature we can accept what we're actually meant to be. We can live in both worlds, so to say. Truly strange but enjoyable movie. Perhaps if you don't understand, you also cannot accept human nature to be as odd and peculiar as it actually is."
Wild Mountain Thyme,29,53,audience,"Sure, this movie is a bit uneven, offhand, crazy, but it still comes out with a 5-star result.  Once again, we see a vast difference between audience and movie reviewer ratings.  Oh, well, too bad the movie reviewers get to discourage so many people who would LOVE this movie.

Think of an old John Ford film (specifically ""The Quiet Man"") set in Ireland with a romantic center, but this time maybe Ford took a few drinks too many and, so, slurred his way through plot points toward the flamboyantly romantic with his full Irish poet self in full bloom.  And that's what you get here.  Director-Writer Shanley writes great lines of dialogue yet, surprisingly for a theatre guy, also fills the screen with poetically moving images (the rain before the raging river was particularly so).   Add in one of the best Irish folk songs and it's quite a package. 

Cast is excellent (yes, even Christopher Walken and his wavering Irish accent, like so what?).  But the two leads really stand out and create a frisson of frustration in a relationship that I, for one, don't remember seeing before.  Here the obstacle to love is not anything in society, but the funkiness of their characters.  Jamie Doran delivers a wonderful handsome but goofball guy who can't bring his love to fruition but, maybe because I'm a guy, Emily Blunt was literally fantastic.  A tough farmer woman, so beautiful but just old enough to aptly convey how long she's hung in on this challenging thing of the heart.  Her offbeat delivery of nutty Shanley lines of dialogue is beyond perfect.  One more thanks to Jon Hamm who always seems willing, nay eager, to play a second banana with superior comic timing.

You can listen to the reviewers or you can listen to me and all the others here who took the time (unpaid) to write 5-star reviews."
Wild Mountain Thyme,29,53,audience,"Look the botom line is this, if you need a formulaic same ol same ol script or explosions or hypersexed melodrama then this is not it. However, if you enjoy a simple story with fun dialogue, beautiful voices and landscapes that you can get lost in then you will love this movie. This hasa classic indie feel and it is a must see. Yes, Christopher Walken's accent is a little off but so what. It is  Christopher Walken and he is wonderful in it. Emily Blunt is perfection in this movie and you will love watching her be fiery and sweet at the same time. Jamie Dornan was quirky and funny and a delight. Some ofthe fast paced dialogue was down right Shakespearean. watch this movie. You will be glad you did"
Wild Mountain Thyme,29,53,audience,"Wild Mountain Thyme....A romantic comedy with an Irish twist.
Being born and raised in Ireland, but living most of my adult life in North America, this movie brought back a flood of cherished childhood memories.
The film features outstanding cinematography that captures the true beauty of Ireland. From the old fashioned kitchen stove and the rusty farm gate, to the cast of eccentric local characters, these little details portrayed an authentic and warm picture of what I remember most fondly about my home country. And at times brought a tear to my eye.
The movie had a charming story and was a light refresher during times that presently seem to have an abundance of negativity.

Nothing excuses how a project with such a strong cinematic pedigree could produce a film that totally misses the mark by such a wide margin.

Wild Mountain Thyme,29,53,critic,"
Practically the only thing missing (and it feels like a near miss) is a leprechaun. Oh, and a plot.
 "
Wild Mountain Thyme,29,53,critic,"
Wild Mountain Thyme is sweet in all the right places, has a great deal of heart, and a certain affection toward those who don't fit into the mainstream.

A look at a farmer's unrequited love for a man in a movie filled with delightful kitsch.

The key problem is that Shanley's attempts to adapt the theatrical rhythms of his stage work to the screen fall flat.

We've seen that cliché so many times that any new version has to bring more to the table than a couple of pretty faces and Ireland's mercurial weather.

Come Away,29,33,audience,"""Dishes and arithmetic...what a dreadful day.""

Absolutely, 100% needed a better title.

Jolie is in more than expected and the film looks as regal and beautiful as any fairy tale should. Big kudos to cinematographer Jules O'Loughlin. It's simply a shame writer/director Brenda Chapman (Brave, The Prince of Egypt) couldn't match her ambition with reality here. 

As it turns out, this is yet another take on Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland as applied to the growing pains of garnering more pain and a better understanding of the world around you. It's a nifty idea (if not obviously derivative) and the tone is absolutely on point, but for a movie about how magical we can make life if we so choose the proceedings of Come Away strangely lack that special spark."
Come Away,29,33,audience,What a waist of time
Come Away,29,33,audience,this was a fun story for the family
Come Away,29,33,audience,"A modern twist of 2 charming tales. A balanced mix of good and evil, whimsy and seriousness, fantasy and realism.  If you have a good imagination, this movie should delight your senses."
Come Away,29,33,audience,"Fairy dust enchants us so much that sometimes we forget that fairy tales aren't entirely sparkly dreams, but daring and brave adventures. In this reimagining of Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pans origin stories, Alice and Peter are siblings navigating a terrible loss. It's a beautifully told story with unique twists but great nods back to the original texts. We've got a full parent review with discussion questions at down the hobbit hole blog. It's an incredibly sad and moving story but there are handfuls of hopeful fairy dust sprinkled throughout the film and the ending. If you've enjoyed remakes, like the newer Alice in Wonderlands and Finding Neverland- this is one you will not want to miss! It's a really creative drama with a lot of heart!"
Come Away,29,33,audience,A captivating tale of family and tragedy told beautifully in a fantastically magical movie.
Come Away,29,33,audience,Very slow. Very dry. Violent for kids. I’m not really sure what the target audience was???
Come Away,29,33,audience,"This looks like a movie I would love: populated with actors whose work I respect and enjoy, two wonderful leads with three gorgeous children, but it never comes together.

The opening sequence is bursting with energy and abandon -- and even an arrow fired that one child looks at as possibly-not-funny. Unfortunately, that same kind of energy and exuberance never repeats.

The lovely period costumes and hairdos wear the actors, and everything feels careful -- as if borrowed from someone who wouldn't be forgiving if anything was broken.

This is a sad missfire, because I love the proposal and the cast is very promising. Unfortunately, director Brenda Chapman's magic touch with animation (BRAVE, PRINCE OF EGYPT) fails to coalesce."
Come Away,29,33,audience,This was a waste of money! My daughter and I were completely confused the whole way through hoping that it leads up to our expectations. It never did! Even the make believe imaginative story was confusing. So disappointing
Come Away,29,33,audience,"Too childish for adults, too boring for children. No idea what on earth this is, doesn't even make an ounce of sense."

The remix of two classic tales, Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland, never achieves lift off as a flight of fantasy.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
If you don't try to wrap your head around the deeper message it may or may not be making, then Come Away is an enjoyable, however forgettable drama about the fragility of childhood. Thinking about it for too long may make you lose track of reality.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
It's unlikely kids will understand these issues, though they aren't treated with enough complexity to engage adults. I'm struggling to work out for whom Come Away appeals.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
Yet, for all its ambition and manufactured charm, this lands as a rather lacklustre melodrama.

I was really ready to be transported, and really disappointed when I wasn't. It's a real shame, because there's a lot of talent in this film but it just doesn't work.

The film is an interesting proposal for trying to create a crossover between the stories of Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland, and thus offer the viewer a new joint vision of both stories. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
But parents be warned: despite attempts to blend Alice In Wonderland with Peter Pan and emphasise the power of a child's imagination, it has some pretty dark moments.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
[I]t's a mostly misbegotten affair, hamstrung not so much by some decidedly wooden acting (as it's nearly Christmas, I'll mention no names) as by a whimsical premise that simply doesn't work.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
This is definitely a tonal soup but, despite the myriad ingredients, the result is still somehow tasteless.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
As well as being glum, though, it's convoluted, and it gains nothing of value from its Lewis Carroll/JM Barrie mash-up.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
We fully expected the children to take a deep dive into their respective fantasy realms... Instead, the plot seems to fall down an overwhelmingly depressing rabbit hole that it can't seem to climb its way out of.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
Assembled with scattershot ineptitude by the Brave director Brenda Chapman, it smacks of a Ken Loach project rebooted by Nickelodeon, but not as compelling as that sounds.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
It never quite tumbles into Wonderland, but the ambition at play - and a top cast of supporting players - is just enough to let Come Away off the Hook.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
The second word in the title should perhaps be replaced with ""off it"". Or maybe replace the first word with ""go"".
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
Chapman is unable to make the more flamboyant touches - such as the fusions of reality and fantasy, often dreamt up by Peter - fly, and it's shot without much energy or style.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
Peter Pan/Alice in Wonderland origin story has grief, peril.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
This fairy tale-tinged costume drama shows what happens when drawing from classic children's literature yields stillborn, dispiritingly literal-minded results.
 "
Come Away,29,33,critic,"
Two origin stories in one holds promise on the page, and it's entertaining seeing all of the Peter/Alice myths explained. But while the magic simmers, it never comes to full boil.

The Trial of the Chicago 7,90,91,audience,Well-performed and wittily written. Definitely worth the watch.
The Trial of the Chicago 7,90,91,audience,"The watch and the patience it required me to finish the movie were worth it for that satisfying and touching final act. Loved the editing and how Sorkin built up and developed each one of the characters, but unfortunately, that hell of a cast and the superb acting and a poignant (and at times funny) script wasn't enough for me to stay engaged throughout the film. Jeremy Strong stole the show for me."
The Trial of the Chicago 7,90,91,audience,"Its a solid film. It has the great dialogue that you would expect from an Aaron Sorkin screenplay. It's entertaining with good acting performances from a talented cast. However, these kind of historical dramas depend a lot on message and themes and there are a lot of creative liberties taken here. It interweaves heavily fictional events with actual events which is rather distorting and verging on propaganda."
The Trial of the Chicago 7,90,91,audience,Tightly paced and well-acted.
The Trial of the Chicago 7,90,91,audience,Aaron Sorkin has really gone downhill. A narcissistic take on a bunch of whining criminals. Stick with Borat Sacha.
The Trial of the Chicago 7,90,91,audience,"Going into a film so steeped in historical events, facts, and undoubtedly some speculation it's difficult to not want to feel both completely educated and entertained on and by the subject come the conclusion of the film. With the second directorial effort from A Few Good Men and The Social Network scribe Aaron Sorkin being based on the violent clash between police and antiwar protestors at the 1968 Democratic National Convention it's even more difficult-given the similar cultural landscape we presently find ourselves in-to not want to first and foremost pay attention to the precision of Sorkin's pen so as to not be swayed one way or another by the dramatization of it all. That said, it's also difficult to not want to abandon the real-life aspects altogether and instead simply escape to enjoy the piece for its expertly crafted dialogue exchanges and period-accurate set decorations with hopes that what is depicted on screen respects the institution of integrity enough that we trust what the film is telling us and what it's trying to convince us of are both genuine and honest. That the film takes the position it does will be an easier pill to swallow for a viewer who stands firmly on one side than the other which raises questions about how those on the wrong side of history now can't see themselves in those on the wrong side of history then, but while this idea might be an aside of Sorkin's it would seem his primary objective is to illustrate the strong foundations of our institutions, but also the myriad of ways in which they can be taken advantage of and the vitality of intent if one cannot find a complete, impartial view of the bigger picture; in essence, Sorkin seeks to create something as close to primary material as possible and in large part-especially for the first hour-you want to believe he has. If The Trial of the Chicago 7 hopes to make you feel any certain way though, it's that type of ""hurrah"" mentality that no matter how evil the bad guys are the good and the just will eventually overcome it. Unfortunately, this take couldn't feel more in contrast with today's world despite the similarities in the challenges our protagonists are up against and the current assault our democracy is facing. Despite the stride towards a more triumphant rather than the more accurately sobering tone in the third act though, Sorkin has pieced together an airtight screenplay with an overwhelmingly impressive cast that executes the material in a substantial fashion giving the project the feel of something genuinely valuable.

Whether dealing with bureaucrats or student zealots, the film has a perspective on social turmoil that falls short of the insightful panorama in the French AIDS-activism epic B.P.M. Sorkin's right-side-of-history saga is the bent history.

I Am Woman,68,68,audience,"The singing style reminded me of the time so ... 70's Good.  You recall Karen Carpenter and others of the era.  It's the placement of words and phrasing, the phrases since in tributes make the song less laid back.  Like Dusty Springfield  and Aretha Franklin's versions of 'son of a preacher man', today's makes ""I am Woman"" from a 70s recording of that time to the attitude of the today its ""woman hear me roar! "" And the original is a good amazing recording, and I will listen to current versions differently.
Tilda did an amazing job, the costumes rock and I wonder where to shop for those clothes.  
The dynamic between the business partner and the male role as manager to the superstar, seeing the man supporting her and uncomfortable with suggested male female roles. The feminist and the judgement of one compared to money and the effort of one mans effort in a woman's success they tried to ... His part in her and hers his story.  Sad they those who judged didn't realize they had their own cheerleaders at home themselves and there was an equality that societally different but only from the lense you look through.    We have come a long way.  And these movies are an important part of the american & world wide women's path.  The steps up.  The growth that one woman's voice became two and then a roar.  On the lawn in D.C. in a women's march, I'd love be to see a documentary on.  We've done so much as have our men.  Men who made it possible for women make the record, who published the book, who stood up for an artist."
I Am Woman,68,68,audience,"Trying to cram Helen Reddy's career into one biopic is understandably a huge challenge.
""I Am Woman"" is a worthy film but for those who know more of the story of Helen Reddy this biopic missed a lot.
However, it remains an entertaining film none the less."
I Am Woman,68,68,audience,"Before this movie I had never heard of Helen Reddy - but it seems she had a pretty good run of things back in the 60s/70s.  I had never heard of the anthem that she sang for the women's lib movement.  The movie shows some of her struggles as a woman and single mom, but doesn't elicit much emotion dramatically or musically."
I Am Woman,68,68,audience,"My interests in this film were piqued only after Mark Kermode named it one of his 10 Worst in 2020. Granted, I can't argue that this biopic isn't terribly conventional and wouldn't look out of place as a Lifetime Movie of the week, but I'd consider it only marginally worse than, and play about as safe as, the Oscar-winning Bohemian Rhapsody, which frankly irritated me more. Charting the rise and fall of Helen Reddy, the Australian songstress/activist, from the late 60s as a determined single mother in NYC struggling to make ends meet, to her rise to fame in the 70s after meeting her future husband/manager Jeff Wald, and then the inevitable decline in the 80s, both financially, as a result of Wald's excesses, and commercially, as she falls out of favour; every narrative beat and turn here are heavily signposted and soaked in familiarity. It's bad enough that her story appears to be entirely made up of rock-and-roll cliches, but screenwriter Emma Jensen's superficial and unsophisticated treatment just made things worse. Tilda Cobham-Hervey's performance as the wholesome Reddy is admirable but dull, while the entire cast is lumbered with delivering Jensen's clunky and hokey dialogue. Yet, I don't think better dialogue could've saved Evan Peters' hammy portrayal of Wald. Call it nostalgia peddling if you must, but where the film works is reminding us of her songs and the significance they had if only for a moment in time. On the other hand, for a film set during the Women's Liberation movement that sees its central female character fights and prospers within a patriarchal industry and writes an anthem for that movement, it's ironic that it's the sisterhood between two working women: Reddy and her journalist bestie Lillian Roxon, that the film ultimately fails to do proper justice to."
I Am Woman,68,68,audience,It's not perfect but thoroughly entertaining and well told
I Am Woman,68,68,audience,"Enjoyed, the actress portraying Helen Reddy did a Great job!  The casting and directing seemed right on.  Well done!"
I Am Woman,68,68,audience,"I'm a fairly knowledgable film person, and I'm old enough to remember the effect ""I Am Woman"" had on 12-year-old me. Is it a perfect film? No. But I think the 66% fresh rating is too low. I'm wary of such ratings when the fans give a movie 8, 9, or 10% points more than the critics. Could it be that critics can be a little too jaded to just WATCH a film and go along for the ride? I found the final scene inspiring! So sue me!"
I Am Woman,68,68,audience,A wonderful yet heartwrenching story mixed with a powerful soundtrack. This film is one of clear passion and storytelling. Definitely worth watching. The soundtrack will live in my playlists for eternity.

 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
I Am Woman is a serviceable and mildly entertaining film, yes, but it still feels like an opportunity missed.
 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
I Am Woman is certainly neither the greatest musical biopic nor the most intriguing account of a musician, but the energy soars during the musical set-pieces - equally aided by compelling performances and efficient world-building.
 "

What makes I Am Woman worth watching (and recommending) is the importance of Helen's story (as predictable as it is).

The South Australian actor here delivers an emotional and memorable turn that the sludgy script almost scarcely deserves.

As Reddy, Tilda Cobham-Hervey's performance brought strength and spark to an enjoyable, if predictable, biopic.

It's hard to forgive the level of clunky, chubby cliches that populates every single scene...
 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
Unfortunately, Cobham-Hervey's hollow turn in the lead threatens to sink the whole enterprise, having more in common with Reddy's conventional music than her revolutionary message.
 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
This defiantly bland biopic of the Australian singing star Helen Reddy, who died this month, manages the remarkably counterintuitive feat of being oddly anti-feminist while describing the life of an acknowledged feminist flag-bearer.
 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
This well-made, sturdy biopic is heart-warming - and Cobham-Hervey's performance is captivating.
 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
Each scene needed a jolt of music or energy that just wasn't there.
 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
The power of her music and the enduring struggle of women makes the film resonate beyond its formulaic surface.
 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
'I Am Woman' is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. But it lacks the drama and depth of other rockstar biopics. Helen Reddy and her anthem to feminism deserve more.
 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
Adding insult to injury, the script often alters or ignores facts for no good dramatic reason, while mostly sidestepping Reddy's vocals to have the actress lip-synch to an OK impersonator...
 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
A winsome Tilda Cobham-Hervey leads a rote rags-to-riches tale, though its rampant sexism is a villain women will recognize. Needs to be seen, even if it's not quite the tribute Helen Reddy deserves.
 "
I Am Woman,68,68,critic,"
If you're looking for cinematic comfort food, this is it. Everything about the movie is as familiar as your childhood blanket, and the lead is engaging...just too bad the filmmakers didn't add more depth...

Mulan,73,49,audience,"I guess that in order to enjoy this film you need to forget the animated original even exists. Yes, it's hard, especially because it gave us some epic moments and characters. The fun, the jokes, the songs, they're not here. And that's why I think it works (at least they tried) in a whole different way. 

Although this live-action version gives us some great sceneries and custom design, it lacks (at least for the first half) the essence and excitement, going for a linear and bland storyline. Everything just feels so rushed. The battle sequences were fun, but nothing outstanding, and this new villainess, I liked her. 

I'm not a huge fan of Disney's live actions, I stay with the animated originals all the way, but this was a mildly good attempt of telling a beloved story in a more ""realistic"" and different kind of way (that I'm pretty sure it will piss a lot of fans of the original)."
Mulan,73,49,audience,"Although the live action had very little that represented the original Disney's mulan that most people expected, which gave such low ratings to the community. Looking at it with out the Disney aspects that so many were looking for, it was an amazing movie, that not only showed true character but gave amazing representation to women, in an era that valued a man's strength over everything.  Not only that.  But the scenery, cosmetics, acting  and costume designs were outstanding.  Based on many reviews and word of mouth I almost didn't give this movie a chance. But I'm glad I did. And others should too.  Basing it off the original Disney movie alone isn't fair. I can see a great deal of work that came forth in creating this movie.  Absolutely loved it. It's a movie that should be given an actual chance instead of being compared strictly to its original inspiration."
Mulan,73,49,audience,Where is Mushu?????? We wanted to see Mushu not a freaking fried chicken??
Mulan,73,49,audience,"""Mulan"" is a boring and slow placed stain on it's animated counterparts legacy."

Mulan,73,49,audience,Magical and inspiring 😊
Mulan,73,49,audience,I loved the idea of Mulan being a badass and owing it in Live action. It unfortunately did not give me the same thrill as the original. There were some hits and misses in the story line and maybe the direction.
Mulan,73,49,audience,"Wish 0 stars was possible. It's not an accurate representation of the actual ballad of Hua Mulan, like Disney kept claiming it would be, nor is even a decent remake of the Disney animated version...it's just bad! Please do yourself a favor and either watch the original animated Disney film, or, if you're looking for a good live action version that's true to the original ballad, watch Mulan: Rise of a Warrior from 2009. Both are much better than this movie!"
Mulan,73,49,audience,"They removed all comedic aspects that were present in the original. There is literally no comedic element to this movie.  They turned a great animated movie into a crappy action film.  Mulan is no longer an underdog, but the best warrior from the very beginning with the use of her chi.  The visuals aren't great. Everything seems to be kind of exaggerated.  The feel in most scenes seem to be similar to stage theater."
Mulan,73,49,critic,"
Underwhelming in almost every sense of the word but you can do worse with these Disney remakes.
 "
Mulan,73,49,critic,"
Mulan is easily the best live action remake Disney has put out, both because the story lent itself well to taking out cartoonish elements, and because the filmmakers put in the work toward making it stand out.
 "
Mulan,73,49,critic,"
Plays like a grown-up version of the animated film, bringing the story into the modern age, while keeping the family appeal intact.
 "
Mulan,73,49,critic,"
I say this with pure irony: Mulan needs to give us a smile. The film is humorless and heavy. It ditches the musical numbers and ample comic relief of the animated version, from Cricket to Mushu to nearly every male character.
 "
Mulan,73,49,critic,"
With its heroic story, intense action and sweeping scenery, 'Mulan' is an unexpected epic-- the kind of escapism all of us could use right now.
 "
Mulan,73,49,critic,"
Beautiful visuals, great performances, and some solid action can't fully mask the rather empty centre that Mulan carries.

The live-action Mulan is not bad. In fact, it's exciting at times. But it could have, and should have, been so much more.
 "

Disney continues its insufferable series of live-action adaptations of animated classics with the dreary Mulan.

If it's going to give us these [remakes], Disney may as well start being bolder. Because as it stands, Mulan is a bland feminist fable that dispels some gender stereotypes but fails to do much more.
 "
Mulan,73,49,critic,"
It is also too preoccupied with being politically correct, which, as far as preoccupations go, is noble, but also something that demands sincerity. There's very little of that here.

Still, Liu is engaging and sympathetic which helps us stick it through to the end, though who the intended audience for this film is remains a mystery.
 "
Mulan,73,49,critic,"
This Mulan is a more straight-faced serious telling of the original Hua Mulan legend. It deals with the heart of a woman and how she struggles between her loyalties to family, country, and herself.

Mulan is a film that entertains, but does not completely satisfy.

The Old Guard,80,70,audience,"Very enjoyable to watch, I was thoroughly entertained and captivated by the movie. I liked the pacing and the action sequences, as well as the performances of the whole cast. Would love to see a sequel, and will probably watch this one again in a few months."
The Old Guard,80,70,audience,This film is the worst. It is simply a predictable redo of HIGHLANDER that relies on tired old redemption tropes.
The Old Guard,80,70,audience,"It does build a very interesting world, and the characters are intriguing enough to watch… With perhaps future sequels. Theron is an amazing star that continues to shine in this film, even if it is slightly unoriginal. You don't need to rush to watch it, but it's definitely worth watching if you have some free time for a decent action film.

The Old Guard,80,70,audience,"This was one of the worst movies I have watched in a while. Its almost like they used an action movie script generator, then stuck some well known actors in the mix, gave them diverse rolls, and shot the movie. Everything about this movie was bad except the cinematography and choreography."
The Old Guard,80,70,audience,Great movie to watch with your family and friends!
The Old Guard,80,70,audience,"In a day and age where action movies lack the smallest amount of good narrative, and every movie seems to be too cheesy or too political, this one lets your take a breather.
so if you love action, but just have to have good story and acting in the movie, then this one's for you."
The Old Guard,80,70,audience,I absolutely could not take my eyes off of this movie I was into it the movie the entire time!! I literally sat at my desk for 2 whole hours because it was that good!! I need the sequel ASAP!!
The Old Guard,80,70,audience,"All-around solid movie, but could've been even better."
The Old Guard,80,70,audience,A must see. Charlize Theron's character and her acting is just amazing. The action and music dope. I've watched like 5 times already but it never failed me as an audience. Can't wait for part 2.
The Old Guard,80,70,audience,So shallow and poor reasons for all actions. Everyone changes their side and awareness too fast. So disappointed....

Bilal: A New Breed of Hero,59,85,audience,"Must Watch Movie!!!!!
One of the most interesting aspects of movie reviewing is looking behind the screen at the provenance of a project, and with Dubai's first ever CGI animation, BILAL, the story behind this 1400-year-old animation saga is truly gripping. Cannes 69th Film Festival is the perfect venue for this, where it will screen shortly. The cast includes excellent actors Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (who played the yacht assassination target for Matt Damon in BOURNE IDENTITY), and Ian McShane from HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" TV series, also PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN.

Eponymous main character Bilal is actually based on a historic figure, a revered warrior, named Bilal bin Rabah. And who was he? ""One of the most trusted companions of the Prophet Mohammed,"" according to exhaustive research done by the film's makers via Saudi-informed ""forensic historians."" What makes this film interesting is that you don't necessarily have to know the backstory to appreciate the master-level craftsmanship on the CGI in BILAL. In fact, this project pays off the promise that 'reality begins at 30 million polygons' as coined by animation forefather Alvy Ray Smith, and really brings home the notion that this technology now has a life of its own as this fantastic tool available all over the world for people to tell make epic explorations.

When you watch this film, you see top drawer animation with a sincere message of ""faith, hope and self-discovery inspired by the real life story,"" as described by the filmmakers.

American actor Jacob Latimore is teenage BILAL. According to Kidzworld, a portal for young actors, this Milwaukee native grew up with a love of Motown and singular gifts as a musician early on with a hit called ""Superstar."" Which means he has the perfect voice control as a voice actor, not to mention his credits include roles in 2014's RIDE ALONG (Kevin Hart, Ice Cube) and THE MAZE RUNNER, as well as a 2010 credit for VANISHING ON 7TH STREET. Over the course of this spirited and engaging film, Bilal's character will age from 6 to 60 years old, and the intricate animation's high-dollar production values make it a pleasure to sit through.

This is a multi-talent collaboration, as mentioned, with clever choices such as Atil Örvarsson, an Icelandic composer, to did the music. Örvarsson said he tried to ""combine the archaelogical, historical nature of the story and make it accessible for an international audience. We used old instruments from the region and combined it with modern electronically synthesised music, we created themes for some of the characters and created a unique, other worldly sound for the witch doctor."" Project point-person Jamal nailed the complexity of producing a movie of this scope in CGI, especially when the Dubai creative climate is more familiar with shorter projects. ""The industry here is based on short movies and originally we wanted to work with an animation studio but we found there was no animation or CGI studio in the MENA region so we had to start the studio ourselves to make BILAL and that's how we established Dubai-based Barajoun Studios."" The film itself was funded by individual investors from the Gulf Region, including Saudi Arabia with the Doha Film Institute. Expect BILAL to be on the radar this year, as Variety, Indiewire, Cartoon Brew, and Animation News have all tracked its progress thus far. Let's hope this film has the harmonizing effect as intended, because the animation is truly pixel-perfect. BILAL will screen this week at Cannes 69th International Film Festival, see schedule here for details."
Bilal: A New Breed of Hero,59,85,audience,"Simply beautiful. Great picturization. of pre-Islamic Mecca and the mind set of the rich merchants.

Bilal: A New Breed of Hero,59,85,audience,"I originally didnt have high expectations after finding this on amazon prime since previous animated free movies on prime were shit. But as I started to watch it, I was immediately in awe of the animation style, captivating story, and fantastic voice overs. It was reminiscent of the prince of Egypt, minus the musical-like feel. I wish this was more well-known and advertised better because it could have easily been a great movie for theaters."

No surprises that intrigue or draw the audience in. The outdated visuals, despite having a unique and consistent art style, take you out of the story.

While ""Bilal"" is a noble effort, and quite involving if you sit back and drink in the visuals, there's a good story here that should have been told better.

We don't get many animated adventures with Islamic heroes and historical Arabian settings, and while it may be too intense for younger kids, the film merits note for bringing these elements to Western family audiences.

The crisply detailed animation is colorful and vibrant. However, the screenplay suffers from awkward dialogue, predictable narrative twists and anachronisms, and earnest platitudes.

Selah and the Spades,87,51,audience,"This felt like watching a high school play except, it dragged on for over an hour."
Selah and the Spades,87,51,audience,"The entire movie falls flat. It tries to cultivate this intrigue and mystique but is more like a high school acting class- where not even the actors are convinced of what they are doing.

Painful waste.

Like trying to show gang violence on a rich boarding school level."
Selah and the Spades,87,51,audience,"A tale about high-school intrigue and betrayal that sometimes takes itself a little too seriously... which is true to the spirit of adolescence in general. Lingering, stylistic, and ultimately a refreshing watch."
Selah and the Spades,87,51,audience,"Never quite understood what the tone was supposed to make me feel. The acting is solid and the film is very aesthetically pleasing, just never really understood the tone and some of the characters very conflicting decisions."
Selah and the Spades,87,51,audience,The inclusivity and the diversity of black womxn and men in this film is refreshing. Having a darker skinned black girl as a dynamic lead character is not something we see very often in present day movies.

ike her two young stars, Poe should prove to be worth watching in the years to come. There's enough to like about Selah and the Spades that it's enticing to think about what she could do with a stronger story.
 "
Selah and the Spades,87,51,critic,"
The film doesn't have much narrative momentum. The various stories don't add up to much, and there doesn't ultimately seem to be anything at stake.
 "
Selah and the Spades,87,51,critic,"
Visually stunning and filled with charismatic performances, it is a mix-and-match of high school movie tropes and film noir crime drama.
 "
Selah and the Spades,87,51,critic,"
It has a woozy, suggestive grip, dangling some questions, answering others. It isn't slick. It's singular - and Poe is clearly a name to watch.
 "
Selah and the Spades,87,51,critic,"
Selah and the Spades is a tremendous directorial debut from Tayarisha Poe demonstrated with acerbic wit and also, a superb acting showcase for breakthrough star Lovie Simone.
 "

Poe's grasp of the world that she creates is impeccable.
 "
Selah and the Spades,87,51,critic,"
Because Selah and the Spades takes the misstep of having a central character with such a dead personality ... this movie that is clearly inspired by Heathers won't ever be considered a cult classic like Heathers.

Somewhere within the bones of Selah and the Spades is a terrific high school movie but sadly, there's a feel of missed opportunity that permeates this frustratingly opaque film.

 "
Selah and the Spades,87,51,critic,"
Poe's steady hand keeps the balance between realistic teen drama and the crime genre, allowing its examination of melodrama surrounding betrayal, rule-breaking and power-grabs to breathe true.
 "
Selah and the Spades,87,51,critic,"
Writer-director Tayarisha Poe's film is worthy, but like Tales From the Loop, purports to be deeper than it really is.
 "
Selah and the Spades,87,51,critic,"
Poe's feature debut, though, has a style all its own, spare but rich and able to make the umpteenth teen movie we've all seen feel fresh.
 "

Visually striking and strongly acted if somewhat weak in a purely narrative sense.
 "

 "

Selah is the center of this fairytale and Lovie Simone embodies the commanding and demanding teen and gives the strongest performance of the young cast.

The Photograph,74,81,audience,"This movie is kind of refreshing to watch. It is a gem for the hopeless romantics. Also, I kind of appreciate black stories that are not trauma stories. I smiled the whole time."
The Photograph,74,81,audience,This movie was wonderfully directed. The actors did great job as well.
The Photograph,74,81,audience,The storyline focuses on more than just mainstream or over dramatized romance. It makes the watcher explore deeper emotions and the reality and truths behind love and relationships. The music is amazing and inspires you to also connect to the subtler emotions. #BlackLove
The Photograph,74,81,audience,"The romance between Rae and Stanfield is fantastic; funny, sexy, effortless, and full of chemistry. The plot often gets in the way of an otherwise leisurely little meet-cute drama, but the winning performances and regal beauty in the cinematography overcome the maudlin moments."
The Photograph,74,81,audience,Black love on every level is beautiful. Loved how this took a look at both past lost love & present new found love. Exceptional and the casting was superb.
The Photograph,74,81,audience,"My husband and I saw this movie when it came out in theaters. First of all,  the movie had great casting and great acting. The plot was okay. The dialogue between Lakeith and Issa fell flat throughout the movie and I found myself bored... The guy sitting in front of me at the theater ...was sleeping. I don't know if Issa Rae wrote this movie. Her show ""Insecure"" is wildly entertaining and fun to watch but this movie was boring. Great actors but boring movie plot."
The Photograph,74,81,audience,"Meh. It's a somewhat conventional love story, the unconventional part being that it finally puts the experience of black Americans at the center, rather than as the ""best friends"" of the main white characters."
The Photograph,74,81,audience,it was too slow and no one showed any passion just a lot of talking
The Photograph,74,81,audience,"The Photograph is a perfectly adequate film, but it's also one that often flatlines when it should spark. It feels clunky at times which is a shame because it had potential to be be better. We start with Michael, a journalist from New York who visits New Orleans to interview a survivor of Hurricane Katrina. When he sees an old photograph of a woman it peaks his interest. It turns out the photo is of an old flame of the survivor who left the area for New York and then became a famous photographer. When he returns home he tracks down the subject and finds out she has passed but her daughter, Mae, lives in the city, managing a major museum. Therein ensues a two fold story. The back story of the photographer and her life back in New Orleans. This is by far the more interesting story. The other story concerns the burgeoning love affair between Michael and Mae. But this part feels clunky and obvious and I never feel a great connection between the two. Standfield and Rae are great talents but as the two leads I thought they didn't have much to work with as their two characters are quite uninteresting. And the film feels badly paced too. A reasonably entertaining film but one that felt like a lost opportunity."

Black Love is a subject that hasn't always been examined positively on the screen. We have had standouts like ""Love and Basketball"" and ""Love Jones,"" but there was still a long winding road to happiness.

The Photograph shows that even though the universe might pull you in different directions, the heart will eventually win if you allow it.

The Photograph,74,81,critic,"
The Photograph makes enough of an impression on you due to its invested acting-but it may lose some of your emotional attachment due to its troublesome screenplay.

THE PHOTOGRAPH's dulcet images may prove to be too muted for some, but for those searching for a raw sensitivity and unapologetic sexuality will be heavily rewarded.

The Photograph,74,81,critic,"
Writer-director Stella Meghie knots up the plot and inserts so many distracting side characters that it's not easy to connect with.

The Photograph makes you want to stick around to see what happens next. This is the nature of romantic dramas - they're the fantasy versions of meat-life relationships.

It's a level of insight and emotion the film should have brought to all of its characters. But The Photograph remains (sorry) underdeveloped.

 "
The Photograph,74,81,critic,"
It's a beguiling combination at first, but the surrounding story is too clunky, the revelations too telegraphed.

At times the story is as sexy and self-possessed as its charismatic leads.

Let Them All Talk,89,51,audience,"Listen, if you're gonna let them all talk, at least give them a better (an actual) screenplay."
Let Them All Talk,89,51,audience,"Let Them All Talk is a gently enjoyable film that provides amusement and satisfaction without reaching any great heights. The latest from Steven Soderbergh was made on the Queen Mary 2 as it crosses the Atlantic. It's a story of old friends reuniting as famous author Alice Hughes, played by Meryl Streep, embarks to England to receive an award. She hates flying so a ship is the only way to travel. To encounter loneliness she invites Roberta and Susan and also her nephew Tyler. The film moves at a gentle pace as we see the main characters look back on their lives and also reevalute their current situations. It tends to be a little aimless at times but there is some appeal in the relationships and the acting involved. A film of small pleasures but not essential."
Let Them All Talk,89,51,audience,"Let them All Talk - D (Dreadful)

Brilliant cast is wasted due to experimentation by Steven Soderbergh. The guy who retired almost 5 times in my lifetime and I'm in my Thirties. He is the Connor McGregor of Hollywood; keep retiring, only to return with duds one after another.

The cast tries its best with whatever bullet points were given to them but they can't save this thin line of a premise even if their life depended on it. Out of all the actors Gemma Chen said word ""Like"" hundreds of times in her all scenes shows how unprepared she was for this improvising class. Lucas Hedges have soo much potential but his choice in movies makes you wonder his reluctance to Lead a movie on his shoulders. His all movies usually have bigger names attached to it from Casey Affleck, Michelle William, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Michelle Pfeiffer and Meryl Streep.

Save yourself and avoid at all cost."

Lacking structure or a defined sense of purposeful direction, Let Them All Talk is guided by the performances of its talented female leads (Meryl Streep, Candice Bergen, Dianne Wiest). Unfortunately, the film is more focused on Streep's stuck-up, elitist high art novelist character rather than on the far more compelling concerns of her less accomplished friends. By its end, Let Them All Talk demonstrates the talk was dominated by its vapid ""protagonist."""
Let Them All Talk,89,51,audience,"Let Them All Talk is a suitably titled film as what Soderbergh did here is literally just let all these great actresses talk and do all the heavy lifting without much direction and editing put into the proceedings. Although slightly scripted and thematically thin, the movie flows well, it is enjoyable throughout and the performances from its talented cast are all excellent."
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
The characters' disconnection from each other also tends to disconnect them from the viewer, making the film's transatlantic crossing aboard the Queen Mary 2 a long and languorous affair.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
There's nothing flashy about Let Them All Talk, and that's for the best. Soderbergh has let his award-worthy cast do what they do best, and they deliver an engaging story that lives up to its unique setting.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
The scenes between Streep and Hedges, a bestselling author and the nephew that worships the ground she walks on, are so effortlessly natural...
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
A clever and absorbing film that feels, alas, a little unfinished and a touch too improvisational.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
The film's chief appeal, by a whole lot, is in watching three AAA-level veterans riff with each other as their director riffs along with them.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
I held on through thick but mostly thin for the fun of watching Streep and Hedges play busily off each other and for Dianne Wiest's imperturbable performance as the surer, more simmering friend.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
It's immensely entertaining to watch these skilled performers wing it.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
As often with Soderbergh, what comes across as lightweight entertainment harbors a deeply insightful awareness of human behavior.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
There's a familiar, golden, rustic hue to Let Them All Talk, and it's somehow comforting to watch these powerhouse actors...masterfully judging and tearing into each other...
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
Let Them All Talk also echoes back to the great independent filmmaking of the 1960s and '70s.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
Soderberg used an unconventional filmmaking method by using only an outline instead of a script, take notice of the cast improvising their lines. It's an enjoyable film about friendship, regrets, and even a new romance, with a natural and organic tone.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
A cadre of great actors using their improvisational skills in this Soderbergh-ian, shot-on-the-fly comic mystery.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
It's an enjoyable cruise where everything simply feels natural. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, etc. - also Available)
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
Experiments more with form than technology, a rare Hollywood movie shot in international waters.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
Everyone's terrific, but Bergen's the standout. She hasn't had a part this good in many years -- it capitalizes on her gift for peevish outrage, and it's the first time she's ever improvised dialogue.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
""Let Them All Talk"" offers enough surprises of tone, pleasures of mood, and piquantly composed images to carry the film through with a sort of visual music, compensating for the dramatic thinness without overcoming it.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
Its contrast between artistic approaches and temperaments, between hiding and revealing, makes for a most amusing, engaging experience.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
Streep's magic act here -- without shedding a tear -- is to draw out our sympathy for a character who, by all outward appearances, doesn't deserve any.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
The intimate photography and intriguing setting are enticing, and the farcical story structure allows its starry cast to deliver relaxed, surprisingly complex performances.
 "
Let Them All Talk,89,51,critic,"
It's a triumph of consummate professionalism servicing slender character sketches and trumped-up intrigue. It's also an absolute delight, even if it's oddly forgettable. But what a sleek, supple ride.
 "
The Climb,90,80,audience,"Funny, intelligent, original... really enjoyed this one!"
The Climb,90,80,audience,"First time feature film makers Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin star as Mike and Kyle in a film that is as unfunny as it is predictable.  The premise of the film is interesting, but there's this goofy mental illness one of the characters has that is played for humor which is repulsive.  There's incredible sound design, so there's that.  Final Score: 3.8/10"
The Climb,90,80,audience,A very realistic story of a toxic and unbreakable friendship.
The Climb,90,80,audience,"Friendship can be a beautiful thing. Sometimes it can be painfully exasperating. And some other times it can be both, as this offbeat indie comedy shows in its exploration of a seemingly mismatched duo of longtime pals. Admittedly, this quirky exercise can sometimes be a little too analytical for its own good, resulting in some uneven pacing and overly talky sequences. However, when its inventive humor works, it's truly inspired, unlike anything viewers have probably ever seen. I just wish there were more of it. When writers Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin come up with ways to make a cycling trip, a funeral and an ice fishing expedition funny, you know these guys are onto something. It would have been great if they could have sustained such inventive lunacy more consistently, but I'll gladly take what they have given us, given that their bits brought out bigger laughs from me than from virtually any other comedy I have seen in some time. This duo is off to a great start with their debut feature, and I look forward to whatever they come up with next."
The Climb,90,80,audience,not at all funny unless you are 12.
The Climb,90,80,audience,"This movie reminded me slightly of another recent film I watched about close friendship, 'Our Friend,' but this one's indie was showing! There was a lot I liked about this movie, including the characters and the writing, even some of the filming style. However, there were these short and bizarre musical breaks that really took away from the movie...not sure what the director was thinking with those.... Other than that and some shawty acting and cinematography here and there, 'The Climb' was a nice little film."
The Climb,90,80,audience,Never cared about the characters to make this compelling enough. Jokes were thin and relied on a bit more complexity of characters being developed.
The Climb,90,80,audience,"This film resembled nothing so much as a junior high school art class project, and not one of those getting above a C. Badly cast and without a cohesive plot or even entertaining side bits it eventually became too dreary to tolerate."
The Climb,90,80,audience,An outstanding examination of the follies and and ultimately the necessity of friendship. The musical interludes to denote the passage of time are brilliant.
The Climb,90,80,audience,"There have been many films about male friendship before, but none quite like The Climb, which is undoubtedly one of the year's best movies. A phenomenal dramedy that is both complicated and moving as well as hilarious in its absurdist humor, it depicts such a complex, toxic, but ultimately inseparable friendship between these two very different men. The psychology behind this friendship is very well explored while the movie is also gorgeously shot, intriguingly structured and filled with immensely memorable scenes interspersed throughout with the biking opening remaining The Climb's most distinguished piece of filmmaking."
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
Instead of mocking traditional American masculinity, The Climb explains why the grip of the tough-guy image is still so strong.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
An absolute gem of a comedy/drama. It's frequently hilarious, and on a different wavelength than most comedies I've seen
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
Cynically coasting in - it's a corrosive speed-bump on the road to bromance.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
The Climb proves that some friendships have more to endure than to endear.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
Profound themes [are] treated with maturity. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
Covino and Martin find a cadence to their dialogue that perfectly props up the tension of cinematographer Zach Kuperstein's long takes that revel in awkward interactions and hard truths.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
The Climb has a lot to say that's true to life, depicting jealousy and insecurities, idiotic power games, as well as genuine affection and moments that, unexpectedly, touch your heart. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
Would've made my list of last year's best films had there been any way for me to have watched it without possibly killing my elderly relatives.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
The only thing I found unintentionally funny is Covino's heartfelt observations.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
Originality is the real juice here. Covino and Marvin tackle friendship tales in unconventional, yet highly rewarding, ways that create organic comedy. It all hits hard.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
Easily the best bromance flick since ""I Love You, Man,"" which is saying something.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
With ""The Climb,"" director Michael Angelo Covino, who wrote the script with Kyle Marvin, breaks the mold with its wildly funny tracking shots, making us laugh even as we're marveling at the intricate technical skill required to pull off such shots.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
For all the absurdist laughs (and not a few cringes) both men wring from it, their interplay feels both inherently ridiculous and entirely true to life; a bittersweet bromance writ in whiskey and spandex.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
Overseeing a series of staggering unbroken takes, Kuperstein floats his camera alongside the characters as they encounter tricky terrain, both emotional and topographic.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
There's a familiarity to a lot of the movie's material, but [Michael Angelo] Covino and [Kyle] Marvin make a notable impression as 'everyday guys' without being generic.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
There are some laughs here, and there's some cinematic dexterity, but I soon found it all exhausting and exasperating.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
Dryly hilarious touches add a stream of laugh-out-loud moments to this gentle comedy about a messy friendship between two men.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
A funny and perspicacious look at what a drag your best friend can be.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
If we're going to spend 97 minutes with a pair of thick-headed dolts, they should at least be cuddly and lovable instead of dull and annoying.
 "
The Climb,90,80,critic,"
""The Climb"" often gets in its own way. Just like its characters don't know when enough is enough, neither does Covino.
 "
French Exit,63,55,audience,"Was truly not expecting this movie to be as ""quirky"" as it ended up being!
I put it on thinking I was about to get a fairly standard dark comedy about a mother and son struggling to cope with a sudden lack of funds but it is SO. MUCH. KOOKIER. THAN. THAT.

The ""Fucked Witch""?
The spirit living in the cat?
The growing collection of roommates?

All totally weird, truly bonkers, and delightful. Pfeiffer and Hedges are as great as always but many scenes were outright stolen by Valerie Mahaffey who really gets to shine in a bigger role than we usually get from her."
French Exit,63,55,audience,"Wow, what an amazing surprise... the trailer undersells this one as maybe something too smug to endure... for the first 20 mins or so, I thought I was being punked, but the film kept escalating into a joyfully clever romp w/o any super silliness, and nothing but great reward by the end.  The entire cast is AMAZING... all of 'em."
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
So while I can't embrace its dramatic import, I can enjoy its comically subversive caricature of aristocratic behavior.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
I'm not fully convinced by what it all adds up to but the quirkiness of French Exit makes it worth the trip.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
Resembles a trans-Atlantic 'Arrested Development'.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
Much of French Exit (if not all, really) is designed primarily as a showcase for the wonder that is [Michelle] Pfeiffer, the actress doing so much with the simplest of words, those pursed lips and a steely gaze.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
Pfeiffer makes Frances fully her own, rendering her spectacularly superior as she mixes with mere mortals and reflects sadly on her life.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
Smart but not a particularly good dramedy.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
French Exit is a messy, uneven film that tries to be too quirky for its own good. The characters in the movie act more and more ridiculous until the story reaches a very uninspired and tepid conclusion.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
It's a warm portrait of a mother and son who are clueless about the world, directed at an unhurried pace by Azazel Jacobs from a script by author Patrick DeWitt.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
Iffy messages in absurdist comedy with drinking, language.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
French Exit isn't a pleasure to watch, even with Michelle Pfeiffer doing her thing.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
One of those camp-inflected dramedies that makes advanced gum disease seem tempting by comparison.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
French Exit is headlined by the sharpest Michelle Pfeiffer we've seen in years, in a role so handsomely form-fitted to her talent, style, and attitude, it's as if the movie had been written with that distinctive curl of her mouth.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
But perhaps the most frustrating thing about French Exit is that watching it leaves me wondering why it was made, and who it's supposed to be for.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
The film is quirky and twee, but Pfeiffer gives a convincing inner life to Frances, who's so odd that to get a waiter's attention, she sets fire to the flowers on her table.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
I felt it was a very mannered performance by Michelle Pfeiffer... I didn't feel like her performance, which was supposed to anchor the film, was very accessible.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
It's be hard to defend this movie as a good movie but it does sort of have its guilty pleasures.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
I am a lifelong Michelle Pfeiffer sycophant so I can find no fault with her performance, I thought she was wonderful, however... it's a fairly pretentious plot that gets more pretentious as it goes on.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
Even when the film as a whole grows a little ungainly, as it fills up with supporting characters who feel more like one-note ideas than actual people, Pfeiffer's steely presence anchors the proceedings.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
French Exit is interesting in spurts, spurned along by Pfeiffer and Hedges, who is also pitch-perfect throughout. But they're stuck in a film that values style over substance.
 "
French Exit,63,55,critic,"
French Exit primarily seems set on proving on how weird it can be, and while it certainly accomplishes that, it accomplishes almost nothing else.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,audience,"A good biopic on Buscetta's life, great acting by Pierfrancesco Favino. (Tommaso Buscetta)
Might be better to do some research on the Sicilian Mafia, before watching this movie.
A fantastic movie nonetheless."
The Traitor,84,70,audience,Your review will help others decide whether to watch.
The Traitor,84,70,audience,A legal drama that is more compelling than I anticipated. The reason is that the movie never really allows for a moment of triumph for Buscetta or the legal system intent on bringing the Mafia down. There are only small victories surrounded by violence and bitter disappointments.
The Traitor,84,70,audience,"The Traitor does have an interesting story at its core that eventually forms enough clarity in its storytelling, but is often erratically and coarsely presented."
The Traitor,84,70,audience,"I absolutely loved this exciting, non stop engaging story. This true crime thriller tells the story of Tommaso Buscetta, the man who brought down the Cosa Nostra. I actually lived in Palermo when this was all occurring and it is exactly as the film portrays. Go and see this with the English subtitles as you will come away understanding so much more about Italy. It suits woman and men."
The Traitor,84,70,audience,not interested in watching
The Traitor,84,70,audience,"Very hard to follow; the English subtitles didn't appear to relate everything being said.  Then again, the subtitles fly by so quickly a person can't read them all any way."
The Traitor,84,70,audience,"Ottimo biopic sulla storia di Tommaso Buscetta, regia senza intoppi e molto pulita.
Favino superlativo, specialmente visto il dialetto che non gli appartiene."
The Traitor,84,70,audience,Although subtitles it was an interesting movie !
The Traitor,84,70,audience,"È un'espressione magistrale di uno dei primi pentiti. Il film colpisce soprattutto per il suo realismo, che ti avvolge, ti seduce."
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
This telling of the story of Tommaso, ... the first high-ranking figure in the Cosa Nostra to inform on the crime organization, rings utterly true as far as it goes.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
As Buscetta, Favino is a terrific presence, charismatic as past Italian tough guys such as Lino Ventura.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
Favino, a familiar face internationally as a lumpen heavy, gives a galvanising career-best performance...
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
Parts of The Traitor take place in the United States. It's always great to see European films with American-set scenes that weren't shot here.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
The Traitor has all the trappings of an indecently immoral entertainment. Yet it has turned out be oddly flattened.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
An authentic and very thrilling film about the mafia's world. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
A complex character study emerges, one that is inherently unflattering (Buscetta is a ruthless killer), in a restlessly intelligent film.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
A brooding, two-inch-thick porterhouse steak of a movie.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
The moral ambiguities and questions of legacy, friendship, family and integrity in Marco Bellochio's The Traitor are the strongest points of an ambitious, punishing addition to a long line of films to explore the inner workings of the Cosa Nostra.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
Carried by Pierfrancesco Favino's layered central performance.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
Most memorably, it captures what it must be like to live your life looking over your shoulder and, given the brazen nature of the men's appalling crimes, the absolute inevitability of their demise.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
Italian mob biopic is courtroom drama with bloody violence.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
Resists the call of ""Godfather"" films' commercialism by providing a truer picture of how the Italian mafia really conducts business.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
A biopic that probably represents the best true story of the Italian mafia on the big screen.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
Both The Irishman and The Traitor explore how hollow the back half of a criminal life can be.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
A legitimately Italian Mafia movie with memoirs, might, mayhem and a running time at least an hour shorter than 'The Irishman.'
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
There's a sharper film lurking somewhere insider... But those wanting a more detailed exploration of organized crime in Italy - and the mental trauma it inflicted on soldiers and civilians alike - would do well to make time for Bellocchio's latest.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
A powerful story well told presages a cloudy future with no silver lining.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
Favino portrays Buscetta as a man struggling with his conscience, not for the crimes he has committed, but because of the storm he knows will rain down on him for breaking years of mafia tradition.
 "
The Traitor,84,70,critic,"
A well-acted and engaging Italian drama about the real-life Italian mafia member who broke the dam on a river of bloody secrets.
 "
1917,89,88,audience,One of the best movies I've seen in years.  The cinematography is fantastic and does a wonderful job of conveying the feelings of the characters.  Great example of a film that uses CGI to enhance the movie but not rely on it.
1917,89,88,audience,"Well, the directing, cinematography, production design, and music definitely deserve their nominations! However, this wouldn't be my pick for best picture of the year. All in all, glad I saw it, but wouldn't see it again."
1917,89,88,audience,"1917 had a ton of hype leading up to its release and it was well warranted.

We finally get a Hollywood blockbuster about WW1 and it doesn't disappoint. It has a somewhat similar style to Dunkirk.

Great film."
1917,89,88,audience,"A movie experience! At times while watching this, I had the same experience while watching GRAVITY back in 2013: suspenseful, realistic, believable, and an intimate connection that at times, makes you feel you're not watching a movie but right beside the characters. Wonderful set designs and cinematography. I've always been a fan of long shots, and Mendes and company pull off an entire film that way masterfully. One of the best war movies probably ever and definitely the type of film to see on the big screen! I'm sure this will clean up at the Oscars next month."
1917,89,88,audience,I enjoyed this...Suspence. Suprise. Drama. Believable!
1917,89,88,audience,A must see for anybody interested in war.
1917,89,88,audience,"A good depiction of atrocities of war without much ado.
I found however the screenplay rather simplistic, esp. regarding the reactions of soldiers at war -- all was too naïve.
I deem ""Saving Private Ryan"" (S. Spielberg, 1998) as a far better humanistic depiction of war compared to ""1917""."
1917,89,88,audience,"More focused on the individual feelings and perspectives of each person than the violence of war (which is a good thing). Amazingly acted, filmed, edited and presented.  You can really feel the passion that Sam Mendez and Roger Deakins brought to this production."
1917,89,88,audience,Esse filme é brilhantemente brilhante.
1917,89,88,audience,"In my opinion this film is a bit overrated because it is true that it has a beautiful photography department, that the acting is excellent and that the style of the director is beautiful, but in my opinion this film is very boring, can not entertain you as it should and so it makes you bored"
1917,89,88,critic,"
1917 can safely be added to the list of movies that have expanded and enhanced our understanding of how truly brutal war can be.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
1917, under the talented hands of Sam Mendes, is one of the best war movies ever made and one of the best of 2019.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
This is a contemplative story of a mission and the men who sacrifice their own safety for the greater good. It highlights the ever-present danger of attack but it is the character's emotional journey that makes for a compelling story.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
A measured compromise of its emotional quotient to create a visual feast, [1917] is undoubtedly impressive while remaining remote.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
Sam Mende's quiet WWI epic 1917 is a cinematic masterpiece, a near perfect war film that appeals to even those of us who don't particularly enjoy war movies ... To put it even simpler, this film is bananas.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
... [C]heck[s] the box that indicates war is, indeed, hell. But this is not the same as actually taking that truth seriously.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
Despite the intermittent cinematographic interruptions to the nerve-wracking immersion in WWI chaos, the movie remains unwaveringly tense.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
Its visual artistry places it among the best historical war films of the past decade or two.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
The film's final hour loses steam and is beset by more than a few narrative lapses it ultimately can't overcome. Still, this is a worthwhile epic best seen on the big screen.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
Although it hardly goes beyond being technically bold, it still is quite admirable in its ambition.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
War is hell and Sam Mendes's hell is quiet and real and intimate and suspenseful and you feel it in your bones long after you leave the theatre.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
At this current level of Hollywood production, expressionistic British militarism is all the same to me and it's worn me out...
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
1917 looks and feels like a 1st person shooter game, and every scene is just preparation to react to what happens in the next scene.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
A dazzling experience that feels both authentic and thrillingly cinematic.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
When the soldiers struggle through near-darkness in a collapsing tunnel, we suffocate with them. When a plane plunges from the sky towards them, it's an almighty effort not to leap from your seat.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
A technological step forward, several ideological and artistic steps back...
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
The narrative may be simple, but the visual approach taken by the film is astonishingly complex.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
The single take is no gimmick, but a way of forcing you to sit through every minute of wartime, with all of its horror and false hope.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
Although the word is thrown around a lot, I would certainly consider 1917 to be a masterpiece in every sense of the word.
 "
1917,89,88,critic,"
While in some ways 1917 speaks the visual language of a current-day shooter video game, the performances elevate the film to almost operatic drama
 "
Little Women,95,92,audience,"Can't speak for it as an adaptation of source material, but as a standalone work the performances are good and the story remains compelling enough. There has been some noise made about how undeserving the film's costume design was of an Oscar considering the many oversights (not limited to one of the literally wearing Uggs at one point)."
Little Women,95,92,audience,"Greta Gerwig's version of Alcott's classic novel breathes life into an old tale for a new generation. Little Women faithfully explores the lives of the March sisters and their beloved stories but it adds a modern edge that gives them more depth. Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh were the brightest stars among a cast of notable talents. Their performances made the most difficult relationship in the film, in my opinion, the most interesting."
Little Women,95,92,audience,"The mutilple awards winner Little women, was directed by Greta Gerwing and is a revisited version of the book Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott (1868). There are multiple versions of this film, but by far this is the most exciting and enjoyable one. 

Meg March (Emma Watson), Jo March (Saoirse Ronan), Beth March (Eliza Scanlen) and Amy March (Florence Pugh) are four sisters that live with their mom (Laura Dern) while their dad (Bob Odenkirk) is away for war. The girls and their neighbour Laurie (Timothée Chalamet) are inseparable and they have fun together everyday. Eventually, time passes by, and by the time they're grownups, almost all of them leave the city to see the world. Meg has now a family, Jo is a teacher, Beth is really sick and Amy is a painter, and her and Laurie have now a relationship. Jo even meets her future husband Friedrich (Louis Garrel). Beth passes away, making the sisters see each other after years apart. 

During their lives, they learn to love, to be independent and to manage the struggles of life. Jo publishes her book and while founding her own school. 

The film was really good, and the cast was on point, and the events that were shown were very similar as the ones written in the book.

I recommend this movie for the people that like love, sadness and adventure all at the same time."
Little Women,95,92,audience,Nem gostei nem desgostei. Achei uma boa obra mas não consegui me envolver com a história.
Little Women,95,92,audience,"A review here has several issues:
- The photography was very well done, the color and feeling of atmosphere was excellent.
- The Period costumes was well planned and excellent
- The acting was superb 
However:
- As a movie the story did not hold together. The editing was faulty, as scenes jumped from one period to another without any warning. The entire flow of the storyline appeared faulty. In Truth, I could not wait for this beautifully photographed movie to finally end. I cannot rate it very high, since the story flow was faulty with what I consider poor editing.
This film version of an English language classic just did not work for me."
Little Women,95,92,audience,"Watching this version of little women was almost painful for me. 
The authenticity of the characters just didn't ring true. We've got Emma Watson as Meg, and Laura Dern as the mom: Wild at heart and Blue Velvet spring to mind.
I can't stop seeing Hermione when I look at Emma Watson..or simply as Emma Watson, but she warmed to the role.  Laura Dern as ""Marmy"" is trite.
Jo's character was anemic. Amy's shrieking had me wish she wouldn't surface. 
Aunt March wasn't nearly the cantankerous, familiar old~Pill we all came to love or at least understand. Beth seems like a cardboard cut-out, pale in personality as well as countenance. Would anyone miss her, really?  Though I must admit when she got smallpox she seemed to come to life at last.   Timothée Chalamet was an adequate Laurie, as much as he was allowed to be. Mr. Lawrence was reduced to a distant presence as well. 
Everything moves at a frenetic speed in this latest rehashing of Little Women; including the actor's speech:  Even when Their father returns from the war, he and Laurie enter the room at a breakneck clip before the family descends on them replete with the requisite shrieking that seems to erupt every time any issue arises in this film.
There seems to be an awful lot of emoting going on in this film but not much of it felt authentic.
I feel this version of Little Women glosses over many important moments in the book;
All is blatant, with little nuance, while the sound appears to be voiced-over or dubbed in. 
I'll admit, there are poignant moments in this version. Mr. Lawrence with Beth when she plays the piano and the beach scenes between Jo and Beth were quite touching.
For a moment or two, I found myself captivated. 
I must admit; I did love the ending.  Jo got her man, [what a cutie Mr. Bhaer is.]
The ending was a joyous celebration of the family, with nice upbeat classical music and zero histrionics! Yea!
P.S.
For my money; the 1994 version of Little Women with Susan Sarandon and Winona Ryder will always be the stand-out version, It's heartwarming and truest to the storyline., Don't miss it!

Little Women,95,92,audience,My comfort movie! The cast & screenplay was amazing. Huge respect goes to Greta Gerwig.
Little Women,95,92,audience,"Before seeing this version, I had seen and re-watched the 1994 film and recently listened to the audiobook. I really like this adaptation!

The actors played characters who seemed sincere, authentic, and actually felt like a real family! Of course, Saoirse Ronan does a great job, but I was especially impressed with Florence Pugh's performance! Also, the young men were cast very well! Timothée Chalamet was an absolutely perfect Laurie (almost imitating Christian Bale's portrayal and making improvements) and I thought Louis Garrel was a much better match for Jo. Personally, I thought they messed up the umbrella scene at the end, but oh well.

The scenery and costumes were great, but there was definitely room for improvement on the appearance of the girls in terms of their ages. Through much of the film, Amy and Beth looked much older than they were supposed to be at the time and Meg didn't look quite old enough.

The timing format with flashbacks, although interesting, was also confusing and basically assumes that everyone in the audience knows (and remembers!) the main plot points already, which is probably not the case."
Little Women,95,92,audience,"Little Women is a classic movie that is based on a 1868 novel by Louisa May Alcott. Out of all the adaptations, this 2019 version holds up as the best. I like the performances of Saoirse Ronan and Emma Watson, Greta Gerwig's direction, the script and the production and costume designs. Overall, Little Women is a classic."
Little Women,95,92,audience,It was a butchery of the book. I was very excited to watch this and within the first 20 minutes I wanted to turn it off. It was simply awful. The acting was good. The story was not.
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
To her credit, and to one's pleasant surprise, Gerwig does not attempt to inject contemporary identity politics into her film, at least not overly so.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
With the high level of acting and a filmmaker proving her chops once again, these Little Women are well worth your time.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
It has all the coziness and warmth one expects from this sort of nostalgic period drama, while also capturing the revolutionary spirit of Alcott's novel.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
A rarity, an adaptation of an often told tale that manages a rethink while still holding true to what made the source material so beloved.

Little Women,95,92,critic,"
Rarely does an adaptation so steeped in the national consciousness and embedded in popular culture hit the right notes in the right order for the right audience at the right time.

These are good people doing their best, loving each other even through their mistakes, and that love emanates from the movie.

Gerwig draws out the progressive strands in Alcott's original, emphasising its latent feminism.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
A superb, well acted adaptation that solidifies Greta Gerwig as one of our greatest filmmakers, that Saoirse Ronan is one of our great actresses, and that Florence Pugh has a terrific career ahead of her.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
[Greta Gerwig] brought a filmmaker's perspective to the story of the March sisters, as she put a meta spin on the proceedings that deviated from the source material ... but seemingly honoured who Louisa May Alcott ... was as a person
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
There isn't a single false note in this tale, and that starts with the acting and goes all the way down to the production design, score, and costumes.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
[Greta Gerwig] indeed offers a fresh spin by infusing her humanistic directorial voice while remaining loyal to the timeless story.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
Little Women proves that Gerwig's directorial debut Lady Bird was no fluke - firmly confirming that she is a great filmmaker; a force to be reckoned with. It shines a new light on a classic story that retains the themes and drama that made it so.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
This was a gamble with a book that is familiar to readers all over the world, and it works. The film is something of a masterpiece, with long, loping scenes shot on location in Massachusetts.

There's wonder and dignity and brilliance and tragedy and joy and worth in all of it and for all of us.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
The joy of Little Women lies in how it embraces the costumes and milieu of its period setting, while the whole thing is permeated with a feel of modernity.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
Little Women is a well-written, old-fashioned movie that will appeal to audiences of all ages.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
It is, like its balance between autonomy and collectivism, a look at ethics that are prescribed and personalized, and most places in between.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
I came kicking and screaming...but now writer/director Greta Gerwig has gone and forced the issue, creating an artful, impeccably acted, and unexpectedly thrilling film that has stubbornly elbowed its way to the top tier of my favorite films of 2019.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
As someone who isn't really a massive period drama fan, I was surprised at how much I adored this and it's inspired me to seek out the novel and give it a read.
 "
Little Women,95,92,critic,"
By focusing the story on the aspirations of women and their position in society, she rolls an adaptation and dissertation into one. Yet, it is always delightful, never didactic.

A Hidden Life,81,72,audience,VERY long... and very slow at times. Wouldn't watch it again. Wish I hadn't wasted my time.
A Hidden Life,81,72,audience,"Terrence Malick has made the same film five times over - this one has Nazis and a resister in it. Otherwise brace yourself for the usual pretty long shots, sun bursts, wide-angled landscapes, odd cuts to people mid-action, close-ups of faces, and breathy cosmic voice-overs (“Father” is a common one here, rather than “Mother” in Tree of Life). Mercifully he kept the insufferability to about 60% for the first 90 minutes...but there was another 90 minutes to go. I find it so hard to get engaged in any of his films except Badlands, because his style is so heavy-handed and opaque, there may as well be a giant “Terrence Malick” watermark on every scene. In this case, the offense is perhaps greater because he’s projecting his limited vision of people’s thoughts, feelings and actions onto real people who actually went through this awful experience. "
A Hidden Life,81,72,audience,"RATING: B+  Director: Terrence Malick 
A Hidden Life is definitely a different kind of truly stunning cinematic experience. The two Leads give great Performances and I really do like that most of the Cast is German or Austrian. Terrence Malick really likes working with Voice Overs here mostly to narrate exchanged letters between the Protagonists. The DP does an excellent Job in capturing the beautiful landscapes and I really would call this Cinematography together with the Camerastyle mixed with the Score, Gorgeous!! Although it's somewhat long at points and 10 or 20 minutes less wouldn't have been that bad."
A Hidden Life,81,72,audience,It was like looking at a calendar for three hours. 
A Hidden Life,81,72,audience,"Malick at his best, which might be enough reason to not watch. I happen to like Malick. It's gorgeously shot, both Austrian alps and the grim prisons. It's slow, but to me, that's his taking time to paint the details, and does he ever do that. There is not a lot of dialogue and sometimes narration, and a lot of silence. Malick raises spritual/philosophical/religious questions he leaves for the viewer to contemplate. That's Malick. And he has, he again left me wiping tears."
A Hidden Life,81,72,audience,Malick complicates the narrative in so many interesting ways that I just don't think I want or need to see a more straightforward biopic about this man.
A Hidden Life,81,72,audience,"Terrence Malick has never heard of editing.

Terrence Malick's historical war arthouse drama A Hidden Life (2019) is unbelievably long at a grueling 174 minutes of brutal Nazi cruelty and silent prayers from conscientious objectors. This story could have been told in a half hour long short film, but Malick forces you to watch 3 hours of farming, torture, and peasant life to get to the inevitable outcome. Malick had 3 different editors and they seriously could not figure out a way to cut these long, dull scenes down to a manageable 90 minutes? 

The issue is not that Malick's direction is insincere or unmoving, but rather that Malick pretentiously insists the audience sit through a slog of images instead of a coherent and concisely told story. This type of arthouse direction is why indie films have a bad reputation as Malick consistently sacrifices digestibility for artistic merit. Jorg Witmer's cinematography has stunning Austrian mountainside landscapes and incredible wide shots, but the moving camera cannot engage an audience like a few choice close-ups might have instead. A Hidden Life is beautiful, but boring I'm sorry to say. 

I think Malick does a disservice to his heroic subject by forcing the viewer to suffer with him instead of defending his position to not swear loyalty to Hitler. There's dozens of minutes of footage of Nazis screaming obscenities and grotesque rage for his actions, but very little of the other progressive side of kindness and morality. Terrence Malick hardly wrote a script with there being little dialogue, conversations, other than the few real scenes and occasional narration. Terrence Malick even wastes a breathtaking score from James Newton Howard as only half of the scenes even use his mesmerizing music. 

August Diehl and Valerie Pachner are gripping leads with genuinely moving performances and subtle acting. But their acting is lost in translation as Malick's meandering direction lets you forget about these characters just to show random wide shots to pretend to be poetic. Matthias Schoenaerts and Bruno Ganz deliver intimidating supporting roles as a Nazi interrogator and a Nazi tribunal judge. They too are wasted on Malick's rambling, sprawling directorial choices.

In short, I have to admit that A Hidden Life is an unpleasant watch and not really worth seeing honestly."
A Hidden Life,81,72,audience,"I love Malick films, and this was definitely a Malick film. But, this one just didn't grab me the way his best films do. Maybe it was too traditional in the way that it told a story with a plot that the audience could actually follow. As a result, it felt like it dragged."
A Hidden Life,81,72,audience,"As with 70% of Mr Malick's latter works, this one runs forever - while telling what amounts to little more than a short story. Deeply felt, spiritual, and at times superb looking, it suffers from his trade-mark extended minimalist style. The editing is often abysmal (in need of a collaborating editor) with jarring continuity jump cuts, possibly revealing the fact many scenes were too long, with little to say, so were cut down to serve their purpose. To some, this may look trendy but for many, it may be shoddy to look at. On paper, this potent story would have looked impressive - yet the final result on screen will reflect only a small percentage of its power. 

For a fact-based story, it amazed me that the cruel German prison system allowed any letters to be written, let alone sent. I'd have also assumed any that were forwarded would have been heavily censored – in this situation that appears not to be the case. Characters often come and go with little introduction, so acute concentration is required. Thankfully, the last half is a little more structured than the somewhat messy first – this helps to follow the shockingly harsh struggle this tragic fellow was forced to endure. His wife and children are left battling the elements and unfriendly village neighbours, as they attempt to survive by working their farm without him. Sadly, it seems the local church did little to support his unfairly ostracized family, giving poor acknowledgement of his strong Catholic faith and the family's church service in years prior. Appears the Catholic Church shamefully colluded with the Nazi war machine too often. This is sad indeed. Germany was determined to take control by force but force devoid of love was bound to fail.

Festivals and those who like Terrence Malick's ‘style' may last the way over-long distance but others may tune out early on. This is unfortunate, as it's a story that deserves a better treatment. An effectively compiled music score helps carry it some of the way. 

Will please devotees or the patient."
A Hidden Life,81,72,audience,"My first Terrence Malick film, and it drove me to search up all his films and write them down so I can find them and watch them. It was stunning and different, so different in the best of ways. A stunningly beautiful, near-perfect film."

Marriage Story,94,85,audience,It was very emotional. I loved it and I would love watch it again someday. The Actors did a great job. It felt so real. It's worth to watch it
Marriage Story,94,85,audience,"The performances all felt natural enough, but I found the film hard to get into. All that really occurs is centered around divorce, and having divorce thrown at you for two hours at a time is rarely going to add up to a positive experience. All of the dialogue and such felt natural, but comparing it to Meyerowitz (the only other Baumbach film that I had seen), I sort of felt like it was that film but without the comedy. I never really felt moved to tears when it was clear that Baumbach crafted certain moments to have that exact effect. All in all, I can sort of comprehend why this was so well-received, but in the end it was not for me."
Marriage Story,94,85,audience,Tensão do início ao fim!!! Laura Dern destrói com uma interpretação única e exatamente no tom!
Marriage Story,94,85,audience,"This movie broke my heart! That's all I have to say. If you haven't already go watch it, you won't regret it."
Marriage Story,94,85,audience,"Rarely all the hype lives up to the actual film nowadays and even less often the trailer captures the essence of a picture rather than mis-selling it. It's funny yet heartbreaking, well-made yet light/casual/real. 10/10 performances from all the cast propel this uniquely raw study of divorce."
Marriage Story,94,85,audience,"Seems like it should have been titled Divorce Story, but maybe the last scene suggests a possible reconciliation.  Then again, maybe it was just two adults acting like adults.  The acting is superb, the emotions in the movie and from the movie to the audience are palpable.  Not much comedy, but some good feelings along the way.  More a drama than anything else."
Marriage Story,94,85,audience,"Excellent movie.  I wasn't a fan of Adam Driver UNTIL I saw this.  He is AMAZING.
It's more drama than comedy, and I was enthralled with the characters and the story, when this type of film would usually start to bore when longer than two hours.  This never bored me.  Complex humans played by excellent actors."
Marriage Story,94,85,audience,"A very well executed film I ultimately did not like. Divorce is a difficult concept to portray and even harder to base a film on. The acting is sublime, and there's even a surprisingly good dark humor at play at times. Nevertheless, the film seems more like an attempt to face a challenge to portray something hitherto unexplored, than its own thing with its own message. The film lacks a stronger point to really be something special. As it stands, the film is a depressing affair depicting how even good people can sink very low in this situation. That may hold some value but is definitely not a must-watch."
Marriage Story,94,85,audience,This movie was very moving. Emotionally. I was a child of divorce and this movie was relatable. Scarlett and Adam give amazing performances.

The Lighthouse,90,72,audience,"Sure sounded like this was going to be a winner. Good premise, actors, scenery. Turned out to be just the opposite. Way too slow and a boring story. Started fast forwarding about half hour into it and saw nothing to make me want to tap the play button again."
The Lighthouse,90,72,audience,"I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for the movie to start, it seemed like days, and then the credits came up indicating the movie was over.  There's two hours of my life I'll never get back."
The Lighthouse,90,72,audience,"This one will definitely bore the heck out of some people.  Great performances by Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe.  I liked this film, but was confused on what was real and was hallucinated.  The film makes the viewer think a little, which is always a good thing.  I'm still not exactly sure what I just saw, but it might be worth a repeat viewing.  Great set design that really captures the essence of this film's isolation."
The Lighthouse,90,72,audience,"Dark, dirty, and annoyingly confusing. Dafoe does a good job delivering his lines in the manner of a nineteenth century seaman, but the movie does little to entertain."
The Lighthouse,90,72,audience,Well acted and directed but not terribly well written. The tension between the two main characters is forced and swings about wildly for seemingly no reason. There are some Lovecraft sea-n-madness themes that don't really land and an attempt at a David Lynch style absence of explanations that end up feeling more like incompetence than a deliberate authorial motif. I have no idea why it scores so high here. It isn't the worst film out there but you can probably find something better to watch.
The Lighthouse,90,72,audience,"Such a strange film. One of those where you question what the filmmakers were thinking. The acting by the two leads is exceptional, but the film's strangeness is personally incomprehensible. I have no idea what all of it meant. It keeps the viewer's attention purely by being bizarre, but at the end of it all you're left with a steaming pile of insanity that almost isn't worth the explanation."
The Lighthouse,90,72,audience,"The Lighthouse is an absolutely wonderful movie. The atmosphere is so wonderfully built that I genuinely will not be able to look at lighthouses the same way again. The cinematography is so cool and distinct that throughout the movie I kind of stopped noticing that it was in black and white, which the movie being in black and white is a very interesting decision. While the movie definitely would have worked in color something about it being in black and white really helps it build the foreboding atmosphere. The lack of any calm blues takes all the comfort out of the seaside vistas, making it feel much more uneasy and isolated. What really makes it all work though is the fantastic performances from both Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, the way you get a feel for the tension slowly rising and falling between them feels so real and they both completely sell their characters. I'd also like to give a special mention to the sound design."
The Lighthouse,90,72,audience,"Dark, moody visuals. A piercing fog horn. Intense acting. This is what makes The Lighthouse a film that pulls you in and won't let you go until the end."
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
The Lighthouse is a crazy hallucinogenic trip that is extremely original. The two actors' physiognomy is very well used. There are many unforgettable imageries. The Lighthouse is a quite unique movie watching experience.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
An expertly rendered gothic slow burn that brings with it an atmosphere of dread which shrouds the film like fog rolling onto shore.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
It's likely you'll find few movies as simultaneously vulgar and literate as The Lighthouse.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
Amidst the dread, and dark humor, and bonkers imagery that makes The Lighthouse a weird little marvel, it's arguably Pattinson who really drives it home as a horror film.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
It's all very weird, psychosexual, comical, surreal, maddening, and even nonsensical at times (merging a bit of Bunuel and Deren with Lynch and Jodorowsky).
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
Too artsy, too far fetched, and by the time we get to any reveals, well, I just don't care anymore. The only reason this gets a 1 out of 5 instead of 0 is the acting.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
It's a bizarre story that is completely engaging thanks to the incredible performances of Pattinson and Defoe.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
The Lighthouse takes so long getting somewhere, and that destination is so murky, that you may well have stopped caring well before getting there.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
Easily one of 2019's most unique, original, and rewarding motion pictures.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
If you ever had a desire to be a lighthouse keeper, I guarantee you, Robert Eggers' The Lighthouse will make you re-think that profession!
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
As a storm rolls in, all hell breaks loose, pitting Thomas and Ephraim against one another. The final shot is a jaw-dropper that will have you chewing over the entrails of this cracking horror movie for years to come.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
Eggers has, in the end, opportunistically produced a paean to present-day identity politics...
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
This is new weird genre territory, and [Robert Eggers] has intentionally crafted a maximalist sensory experience.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
Hitchcockian sexuality and Kalatozov-esque atmospherics aside, Robert Eggers is eager to plunge audiences into the fog.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
For all its powerful performances and haunting imagery, its setting is too bleak, its narrative too experimental, its director too indulgent, its purpose for existing too unclear.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
The primal violence that often binds men has rarely been evoked as intensely ... [Dafoe and Pattinson's] pairing provides a recipe for one unforgettable moment after another as they drink, dance and dispute over everything, from supper to superstitions.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
The pair strike a perfect tonal balance. Can a duo win Best Ensemble at the SAG awards? It would be well-deserved in this case.
 "
The Lighthouse,90,72,critic,"
Atmospheric it may be, but The Lighthouse is in other key respects very, very dull indeed.

Pain and Glory,96,91,audience,"Pleasantly light on its feet for the large part, and with some pleasing sleight of hand moments, the movie doesn't get dragged under by the weight of its lead character's burdens as it threatens to in the mid-section. That said, the mid-section does get a little maudlin and, as a result, soupy, meaning the overall film feels a little more slow-paced than ideal."
Pain and Glory,96,91,audience,"Definitely one more for fans of this filmmaker's work. Undoubtedly rewarding for some, but for those of whom that have seen none other of Almodovar's filmography, proceedings will be dull and self-indulgent. Banderas gives it a good go, at least."
Pain and Glory,96,91,audience,A beautiful story told in a way only spanish cinema can do it.
Pain and Glory,96,91,audience,Your review will help others decide whether to watch.
Pain and Glory,96,91,audience,Pedro Almodóvar love tale could not be better with a breathtaking performance by Antonio Banderas. ‘Dolor y gloria' is pure art.
Pain and Glory,96,91,audience,More subdued than what you generally get from Almodóvar. I like the way the narrative is framed around not just the importance of art but the power of creating it.
Pain and Glory,96,91,audience,Banderas is great in this semi-autobiographical of the director's life.  Provides all the real feels and a surprise or two.
Pain and Glory,96,91,audience,"This film in general is worth 5 stars. It has beautiful scenery and shots and tells a story well with a kid living with his parents in a nice cave to his adulthood in filmaking. However I just found it to be  offensive at times, but it is truly a well done picture."
Pain and Glory,96,91,audience,"This film took me by surprise. Emotional, simple, realistic yet surreal. Incredible directing and acting. A heartfelt story."
Pain and Glory,96,91,audience,God dang this is an abomination of a movie. The first 20 seconds of the movie I got so annoyed and cringed out so much. How the jell did this movie get nominated for best picture. This may have to be worst picture of 2019. By god almighty it's bad and I know what you're saying. This is a push toward in Latino cinema. And I say no Roma the movie last year was a push forward. Roma made me think. This movie with Antonio banderas didn't. Lo siento.
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
Without his noted frivolity and transgressiveness, how much is there to Almodóvar's work? Entire stretches of Pain and Glory are terribly dull, flat and mundane.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
""The film may seem to start as a film filled with regret and looking at your past but instead finishes within an incredible sense of optimism""
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
Pain and Glory is Pedro Almodovar looking back at his own storied career, one full of personal choices, refusals, and decisions that defined who he is.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
Antonio Banderas... is tremendously layered as the despondent Salvador.

Glory came accompanied by pain, feels absurd but, isn't reality absurd? An impecable work from both Banderas and Almodovar. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
There's no denying the potency of the performance at its centre, with Banderas delivering what is potentially a career-best masterclass.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
Pain and Glory is the Spanish auteur's scrapbook of memories culled from his own life -- a fictionalised self-portrait which journeys into the heart, mind and soul of a man mesmerised by movies and weakened by numerous maladies.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
Has the aesthetics that always characterize his style and some moments of affectivity, but it lacks emotional strength and I immediately perceive that it becomes self-indulgent with the story of the film director. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
It's sometimes funny and mostly pretty grim, but the patient pacing and wistful dialogue give even the bleakest moments a sense of bittersweet beauty.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
Pain and Glory not only shows a brilliant artist still operating at the peak of his creative powers, but also reunites him with his most important male lead.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
Pain and Glory is a patient film, it quietly sits in wait, encouraging you to create new memories by revisiting your own old memories.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
Banderas is the best part of the movie, with a tour-de-force performance...a master filmmaker forging a new path...
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
We are seeing the world - in all its sadness and beauty - through his eyes. Banderas brings it all to life.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
As slow and meandering as the film feels at times, DP José Luis Alcaine's eye is a constant that enlivens the screen when the narrative struggles to.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
In his assemblage of the film, Almodóvar imbues ""Pain & Glory"" with a wonderfully lyrical lilt. He weaves the film's many themes gracefully, with the measured contemplation of a musician putting together an album.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
Like many of Almodovar's films, this one is emotional and personal. I think this film appeals to an older audience with its story about reconnecting with one's emotional center, after suffering despair brought on by age and medical problems.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
Courtesy of Almodóvar's masterful direction and a career-finest performance from Banderas, we feel every moment with Salvador. The pain, the glory, and everything in-between.
 "
Pain and Glory,96,91,critic,"
I love seeing Banderas directed by Almodóvar, especially in this role which is obviously a stand-in for the director himself. He uneasily occupies the screen, clearly trying to manage both his pain and his loved ones' response to it.
 "
After the Wedding,45,76,audience,The acting by Michelle Williams is amazing.  The plot and ending fall a little short but I don't regret watching it.
After the Wedding,45,76,audience,"Pretty original movie, and very well acted of course. I can't remember a movie with the same synopsis. Just another one where the critics got it wrong as the audience rating is the opposite."
After the Wedding,45,76,audience,"La película cuenta con excelentes actuaciones, nada más, se puede disfrutar cuando se pasen canales y no se encuentre que ver, pero para el cine no."
After the Wedding,45,76,audience,"An American remake of a Danish film, After the Wedding is a captivating character drama.  When the manager of an Indian orphanage comes to New York to secure funding from a wealthy businesswoman she soon discovers that her potential benefactor has an ulterior motive.  Starring Julianne Moore, Michelle Williams, and Billy Crudup, and film has a solid cast that delivers some good performances.  However, the script is a little thin and the pacing is kind of slow.  Yet while it has some weaknesses, After the Wedding is a powerful film about love and family."
After the Wedding,45,76,audience,All I can say is WOW! The acting is incredible and the story will stay with you for a long time afterwards. Get the tissues ready!
After the Wedding,45,76,audience,"Moore and Williams give powerful performances as both women of purpose and mothers.  Williams is about to be the beneficiary of Moore's good will, but finds out that it's a much more complicated situation."
After the Wedding,45,76,audience,The trailer was completely deceiving!
After the Wedding,45,76,audience,"Haven't seen the original. While some of the plot developments and characterisation work is untidy, the film summons plenty of intrigue by masquerading and gradually revealing the secret being harboured on which it's built. Boosted by the fine performances."
After the Wedding,45,76,audience,good potential - plot was interesting but horribly executed.
After the Wedding,45,76,audience,"Could be good, but is that kind of movie where you get really angry because all the caracters seems to be really stupid."

 "
After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
What this unusually static affair lacks in urgency, it does make up for with committed, intuitive acting.
 "
After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
The gender flip turns After the Wedding into a decent feminist statement, albeit one without the edge of the original.
 "
After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
[It] doesn't fully trust its own story and tries to dress it up with an air of ominous mystery that winds up undercutting the drama rather than adding to it.

See it. After the Wedding deals well with the complicated nature of regret in the adult world.

These two ferociously talented women are just too good to miss at any time and together they are a powerhouse. There's a lovely restraint here...

After the Wedding is one of those thoroughly inessential yet subtle and well-crafted films made for grown-ups who like sitting back and watching the inner turmoil of other grown-ups.

File under decent, but disappointing and start seeking out the excellent Danish original.

After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
The film's top-notch cast are let down badly enough by the clunking screenplay, but they are entirely defeated by the ethical vacuum at its core.
 "
After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
The polished version of Susanne Bier's 2006 film resolves itself too easily but the performances by Williams and Moore shouldn't be missed.
 "
After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
As heavy-handed as the production and costume design are, the moments when Moore and Williams share the screen hint at a powerful tale of mothers, daughters and love that this film, sadly, can't quite reach.
 "
After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
It feels like all these characters are tiptoeing around certain subject matters for the purpose of prolonging the narrative. Why are they so afraid of asking obvious questions?
 "
After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
With what started out as a simple transaction, After the Wedding becomes a confusing melodrama and the need to drag out this complex love triangle almost nullifies any emotionality it creates.
 "
After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
A film that doesn't know which story it wants to tell.
 "
After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
Even Dynasty wouldn't have attempted the sort of daft plot twists on show here.

I'll give no more away here, save to add that just when you think you've been dealt as many improbable twists as any single melodrama can decently produce, along comes another whopper.
 "
After the Wedding,45,76,critic,"
The Sad Rich White People Movie is one of my favourite genres, and indeed the white people in this English-language remake of Danish film-maker's Susanne Bier's 2006 tearjerker are very sad and very rich.

Director and writer Bart Freundlich lets the story breathe, trusting the actors to do the emotional heavy lifting.

I wanted to be swept along by the heft of it, and there are moments it could have happened, but in the end it was merely a waft.

For all of After the Wedding's narrative twists and turns, there's nothing here that feels close to earth-shaking.

The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,audience,"A good movie. Sure there isn't much here that is new or incredible, but it delivers an entertaining feel-good story with some clever elements. Forgive the cliché plot points. It's nice to have some familiar movie elements presented in new ways."
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,audience,"A great movie, that has a unique flavor and style. For people who want to laugh a lot to a clever humor <3"
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,audience,"This is one of the best movie i have ever watched in my entire life! Indeed an eye opener about society, politics, government and of course money!"
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,audience,"A tale about a crime which, surprisingly, talks about capitalism, philosophy, and good intentions. Not a bad result at all, even if sometimes the plot is lees important than the message."
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,audience,"This film seemed to be a white supremast incel's wet dream. The bad guys are the only non-white in the movie. There are multiple references to the jews, the Irish, the arabs, the feminist judges.. The story is of a white guys who is super brilliant. So much so that he can't keep a girl. He then takes huge sums of cash, with no regard to security cameras or the tracking equipment on his van, hires a prostitute with is (who has a heart of gold, sees his vast superiority to all the men she's been with and falls in love with him), hires a notorious criminal straight out of jail and a dirty financier, then gets to keep the money because the liberal government of Canada is no match for his brilliance. Really terrible movie that I wish I could erase from my memory."
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,audience,Very well done (for a Canadian movie) Laughed throughout the movie!
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,audience,This was a very clever film with fascinating dialogues and great acting. I'm not sure why it was named with America in the title since it took place in Canada although the main character's opening lines alluded to the fall of America.
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,audience,I really liked this Canadian-French film.  It wasn’t terrible what I expected.
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,audience,The Fall Of The American Empire is a satire about an academic who delivers packages who ends up arriving after a hold up has taken place and two people are dead and two full bags of money are just lying there. He runs off with it and that's where our story kicks into high gear as he tries to figure out what to do with this money while falling in love with an escort and the police are hot on his tail. This is a crime caper that is very satirical and most of the time the director Denys Arcand hits his targets precisely and there are a lot of laughs. Sometimes the satire is scattered but most of the time this is a very entertaining film that thrills and is very funny and is different from most films playing currently and it's a worth a look if you're into satires or just crime films in general.
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,audience,A very good film and story
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
For those who prefer their larcenous high jinks leavened by a serious social conscience, this ebullient romp is just the ticket.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
If it feels like everyone's a tool in a script instead of an engaging person, that's because that's the case.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
I love the way [director Denys] Arcand blends different genres. This is satire, a romance and also a thriller.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
...a thoughtful, good-hearted film full of unexpected turns, that has something in particular to say and it says it in a gentler, subtler way than most social satires might.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
Arcand ends up overextending the crime-movie motif by trying to fashion a sedate tale about morality, which is an interesting premise, but this flatly acted heap of malaise doesn't do the idea justice.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
Sure you've seen a lot of this before, but Arcand and the cast manage to give it a fresh and interesting spin.

There are bigger incongruities around the corner... that bury the film's credibility.

Liked everything abut this movie from its crafty actors to its crazy plot. Maripier Morin and Alexandre Landry are stars of tomorrow.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
The Fall of the American Empire sets up, however halfheartedly, a classic premise about sex, greed and crime. Unfortunately, the film never gets us to care about the characters, who seem to only talk in plot points and themes.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
Arcand's message is as blatant as his heist plot is subtle, and perhaps that's the point.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
There are some sweet moments in the film, and a couple of extremely violent ones, quite frankly, not enough to earn the film's R rating. But overall, the movie is just a question mark.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
""The Fall of the American Empire"" does only one thing well: fall apart. Gracelessly. Stupidly. And without a shred of self-awareness.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
Long-winded, ineptly-plotted satire of broken Western Civilization and the capitalism that killed it.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
Even at a slightly too long two hours plus, the well-acted, unconventional (albeit flawed) escapade has more on its mind than most heist films. I do wish it had more effectively presented its arguments.

The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
[The Fall of the American Empire] is at its best depicting a certain optimism in the face of all these malicious and random forces.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
A provocative, witty and captivating crime thriller for adults. It's a great antidote to all of the loud, dumb and shallow blockbuster films.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
See it and be surprised and amused.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
The key to the movie's success is the dexterity with which Arcand has folded his socially conscious message with witty caper comedy, even if the darker elements aren't always a perfect fit.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
Denys Arcand once again explores society's downfall in a tale about greed, corruption, and extravagance. The crime caper is reminiscent of an Ocean's film as the thieves make it look easy.
 "
The Fall of the American Empire,60,77,critic,"
Audiences (myself included) have an insatiable appetite for caper movies, but while trying to justify itself as a social critique, The Fall of the American Empire too often fizzles.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,audience,Solid biographical pic highlighting the background leading to the defection of Nureyev; generates enough intrigue for a very well known outcome; strong dancing to bolster the solid drama
The White Crow,67,81,audience,"This a very powerful movie, truthful and straightforward. The strong personality of Nuriev just captivates the audience. The challenges he goes through are depicted so realistically but the spirit of Art and Liberty in dance, painting, and architecture is growing  stronger. And finally, it wins."
The White Crow,67,81,audience,"Wonderful movie, and Oleg Ivenko is a delight to watch as an actor and a dancer.  I think the timelines are masterfully woven together.  I felt I was authentically taken to that world, and I was glad to be there."
The White Crow,67,81,audience,"You wouldn't think that a ballet dancer and the KGB would have much to do with one another - but in the 60s, I guess they did.  True story of Rudi's defection and media sensation is alright - it's no nail biter or tear jerker.  Just kinda there"
The White Crow,67,81,audience,It was a wonderful look into the life and personality of one of the most intriguing performers of the 20th Century.  Mezmerizing dancer - larger than life.  Oleg was superb as Nureyev - especially his dancing.
The White Crow,67,81,audience,"Whilst the dance sequences are excellent with Fiennes' adroitly showing the full body of the dancers so one can see every line, the rest of the movie is either dreary and jumps around the timeline far too much so it makes no sense for anyone not already very familiar with Nureyev's story, or there's unnecessary nudity and sexual scenes. Most who know of Nureyev will know he was gay - he died from AIDS before any drugs were developed for the condition - and so one does expect references to the man's homosexuality. 
      However, there's a difference between scenes which are designed to explore a dancer's sexuality and ones which are just gratuitous and this film has many more gratuitous sex scenes than meaningful ones. The dancer who plays Nureyev, Oleg Ivenko, does an excellent job playing the famed - or infamous - dancer however the script itself isn't the best. 



      This movie is really only for people who already know Nureyev's story and love dancing. Even then, there's too few scenes of dances or warm-ups, and the remainder of the movie seems very dreary by comparison. Those viewers who aren't familiar with Nureyev's story will struggle to understand exactly what the film is about. It's clearly about a Russian dancer but the rest of the story of Nureyev's life, including his defection to the West, is muddled and confusing even for viewers who know the tale. 
      Fiennes is excellent as Nureyev's ballet instructor, playing a tersely spoken man who seems to be beaten down by life but nevertheless understands Nureyev's yearning for self-expression and, therefore, his defection. However, as a director - and this is Fiennes' third time directing a movie - this movie leaves much to be desired and the script should have been re-written to make it both comprehensible to any viewers as well as interesting. 
      When the scene is not focused on dancing itself, whether warm-ups or on stage, the movie seems to drag on and actually becomes tedious if not actually boring, so that the viewers will only become interested when dancing occurs. This is a great pity because with an actor and director of Fiennes' calibre and the skills of dancer, Oleg Ivenko, this movie could have been so much better than it is."
The White Crow,67,81,audience,"Although the actor/dancer playing  the great dancer looks and dances nothing like the man he is supposed to be playing,  the lead still plays the role well and dances equally well, and the story is compelling. I can remember when Nureyev defected and seeing him with Fontaine  in An Evening With the Royal Ballet."
The White Crow,67,81,audience,"An interesting biopic of the life of the ballet star Rudolph Nureyev told in a workman-like manner. The film deals with Nureyev's early development and career in Soviet Russia up to his defection while touring in France in the 1960s. There is certainly plenty of material and the story does well to focus on the driven but cool relationship between the mercurial dancer and his quietly understated mentor and teacher Alexander Pushkin. However, I do think it is a shame that it didn't take the story beyond this point and examine what a huge star this man became and the dancing relationship he formed with Margot Fonteyn. Good though this movie is, the traditional and linear telling does miss a trick here and I really would have liked to see more dance. After all, it is what the man was brilliant at and it seems a shame that we don't see some recreations of his most famous works."
The White Crow,67,81,audience,"This film is based of off the book Rudolf Nureyev: The Life by Julie Kavanaugh. Nureyev's life is spread out into 3 important parts in this film: His childhood, His training as a dancer, and the start of his foreign performances. In the film you will see that Nureyev is considered a talented dancer, but is often criticized for being undisciplined. This shows in his escapades in Paris, because he puts the KGB through their paces. The film will probably speak to dancers more than non-dancers."
The White Crow,67,81,audience,"So much to do, so much to work on. Art is a game of sacrifice and there goes the head of that very personality.

The White Crow

With only three and sincere films out, Ralph Fiennes should be on your list just as it is mine, if you wish to sober up with a film. He has explored various subjects, heavy subjects in these films. Something that is not usually advised or even dared. Yet, post three successful films- successful as in they're good- Fiennes remains barely high on his skills. And unfortunately that is not a compliment in here. Usually this is a good thing. But as a director you are required to be confident in your material, your characters, your film. And what is at loss here is the attention of the audience. You have to be in command of those two hours as soon as the lights shut down and the magic begins.

What is happening now, is that the audience finds itself promising for a truce to meet the storyline, the characters halfway there. That is not a commute I'd like to do. I say commute because I have been through that road a lot. So why and how does Ralph's film still manages to dance at the tip of its toe, the entire show? It is the debates. The arguments, productive and sometimes just thrilling debates, is what seduces you to do the right thing.

Or wrong thing. It is personally motivated and emotionally challenged. That is all that matters. Ralph has a spectacular way to move the audience. And for a dance themed film you would assume that it is the razzle dazzle show or the textbook training montages that will swoon you in. But remember the seduction in the film is always wrong and challenged. And so it is in the film The White Crow, not the hardworking nor the pay off, but the leisurous time that it spends more than it earns, is the logic Ralph pursues."

If you like a sad but true and triumphant history lesson, or you just love dance, go check out The White Crow. Rudolf Nureyev's story should inspire you.

The White Crow winds up falling short as a respectable but not-quite-inspired portrait of an extraordinary talent.

Just like how Pushkin asks why artists plunge so much into their craft, I couldn't help but ask why Fiennes and Hare wanted to tell this story.

The White Crow is a decent film giving light to an artist you might not know and humanizes him along the way.

In the last half-hour, at just about the point that you're as sick of Nureyev as his KGB chaperones must have been, the movie takes off irresistibly as a thriller.
 "

The White Crow powerfully suggests that an appetite for appreciating art as well as performing it shaped Nureyev's fluid self.

I am found myself fairly taken in with this just as a [straightforward], good, sensible drama.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
The White Crow offers up all these elements of Nureyev - his past, his heat, his vulnerabilities - but all those parts are dancing around each other incongruously rather than as a well-choreographed ensemble piece.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
Lacks that passion, spark and danger which made Nureyev such a master.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
It was probably a much better idea to get a real Russian ballet dancer to play the role rather than an English-speaking actor with a phoney Russian accent and a dance double.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
...a taut dramatic thriller that is as much about overcoming adversity and the drive of an artist to be free, as it is about Nureyev, the Cold War or ballet.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
The solid final 20 minutes of the film demonstrate how strong a director Fiennes can be, but it's a slow, obviously deliberate build up that might test the patience of those who don't have a standing interest in the dancer or of this period in history.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
The Nureyev story is a very good one, and Fiennes and Hare tell it well.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
In his biographical drama, director Ralph Fiennes takes a plodding yet scattershot approach to dancer Rudolph Nureyev.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
The film gives the impression that much of Fiennes' attention went into working with Ivenko on shaping the details of this portrait -- and it is psychologically convincing, whether or not it has much to do with the real man.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
The depiction we get of Nureyev, as captured by newcomer Oleg Ivenko, is one of frustrating inconsistency.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
That common dance-movie trope of technique versus passion applies to the film itself, which is handsome and correct in form but somewhat lacking, at crucial moments, in life and spark.
 "
The White Crow,67,81,critic,"
It is made more dramatic by Nureyev's frequent tantrums...and made worse by the over-exposure of persons important to the plot, but useless as characters worth caring about, such as Exarchopoulos' socialite, Saint.

Diane,93,69,audience,"Why does it seem that a good character piece almost never comes with a tight story line?  I'm getting tired of movies that are ""a slice of life"" and nothing else.  Tell me a story, dammit!  Also, if you like the word ""Goddamn"" you are going to love this film.  I'm thinking that the Goddamn drinking game would be appropriate.  Very lazy script-writing."
Diane,93,69,audience,An intimate and earnestly acted film with some relatable dilemmas that fuel the searing titular character study.
Diane,93,69,audience,"Diane is an analysis of life and how we deal with grief and guilt. This film may not please everyone as it does take a darker path. However, Diane offers up a very engaging story and thanks to incredible performances from the entire cast, including Mary Kay Place, the film felt so raw and real, as if you were peeking through the curtains on someone's life. There was one pretty significant plot hole, however I didn't think it hindered the film too much."
Diane,93,69,audience,"The acting is first-rate, and it's great to see older female actors in abundance.  I just wish they'd been better served by the script, with elements that are confusing, implausible and unoriginal. In the end, I wondered if the writer understands women as much as he thinks he does."
Diane,93,69,audience,"The lead actress did a great job of conveying how problems with others cause grief within ourselves and we cope in our own way, some take drugs, some drink and some are self-destructive."

Diane,93,69,audience,"Mary Kay Place is 'Diane', a feature written and directed by Kent Jones, works until is doesn't.  One thing is for certain: before the third act it's really good.  There is a genuine feel here with a lot of things going on that could happen to anyone, however, a great supporting cast and spirited performances can't overcome a final 30 minutes that just didn't congeal.  It's a bit hard to follow and you'll have to connect the dots and your mileage may vary by how invested you are into the titular character.   Wife: 6.0/Hubby 7.4 Average Score: 6.7/10"
Diane,93,69,audience,Very good character study and one terrific petformance.Depressing as hell but a rewarding watch.
Diane,93,69,audience,"A quiet character study that steadily grows and involves you like a blanket. Mortality and kindness are the pillars in this story, that does not answer questions, nor is asking them."
Diane,93,69,audience,"Very depressing film about a lady who lived a good life, trying to help others, and got a raw deal at every turn.  It was supposed to be about her redemption, but I couldn't wait for the last 15 minutes of the film to see if that ever happened.  Good acting by Mary Kay Place."
Diane,93,69,critic,"
Mundane and melancholic, a day-to-day sameness that is crushingly cyclical. And yet, there is comfort in the cycle.
 "
Diane,93,69,critic,"
The clear-cut narrative of the film's first half blooms into something much more oblique, at times even surreal, diving into its lead's psyche and exploring the boundaries between who we are, who we were and who we will become.

For decades Kent Jones has been one of the most eloquent and perceptive film critics in the U.S.; with this devastating chamber drama... he also proves himself to be a keen observer of psychology and American social mores.

Similar to Alfonso Cuaron's Roma, Kent Jones' film takes a look at the life of a caregiver with an intimate yet depressing eye. Sadly, it is not as clear and as visionary as Cuaron's film.

The film's existential questions ultimately inspire one to sit up in the movie theatre and wonder, ""Why am I here?""

We usually expect that a film named after its protagonist will sooner or later reveal everything about that person, give us the whole woman; Diane, by contrast, comes in pieces
 "
Diane,93,69,critic,"
Kent Jones, primarily known as a film critic, clearly understands what makes a good story and how best to tell it. There's not a false note in the movie, a point where you might think: ""oh, no one actually would say that.""
 "
Diane,93,69,critic,"
Jones is less interested in narrative than he is in mood and tone. Many of the scenes in ""Diane"" are set-pieces, all featuring Diane doing her daily rounds... And in all this, actress Place is perfect.
 "
Diane,93,69,critic,"
The film's pacing will be a struggle for younger audiences, the subject matter, a bitter and unpleasant pill for older audiences.
 "
Diane,93,69,critic,"
The film is an empathetic look at a character who is trying to stay strong for everyone around her, but as the film progresses, we see a Diane with tired eyes and a demeanour drained of that matriarchal strength.

Cold War,92,81,audience,"Beautiful cinematography, complex characters, simple and perfect."
Cold War,92,81,audience,"The greatness of the film lies not only in its dramatic and sensual portrayal of love with all its passions, sorrows, misunderstandings and steadfastness, but also in capturing this very subtle yet extremely realistic historical background of polish communism. I found the movie irresistibly romantic, the story can be almost said to be the social communism equivalent of the very shakespearean tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. Never before have a film combined so swiftly artistry with realism adding to it this great expense of emotions that literally can be felt by the audience. In one word; Pawlikowski's masterpiece both visually and 
lyrically."
Cold War,92,81,audience,"I really liked the black and white filming and the camera shots of Cold War. I watched this on Amazon and kept thinking it was shortened and scenes were left out. I love watching foreign films with subtitles but I found myself lost with this storyline. Also, I do not need a subtitle of a dark barking or a cow mooing, that was irritating. I did not feel it was Oscar worthy and almost turned it off about 3/4 of the way through. Decided to stay with it for the conclusion but did not feel the ending was fitting."
Cold War,92,81,audience,"Long boring Oscar type movie starring who knows and who cares. Foreign films aren't my thing, I apologize in advanced but my question was why did I think it would be good?"
Cold War,92,81,audience,An Oscar bait film that is worthy of the hype. It's very well directed and shot. The writing isn't original but is good. If you're a fan of foreign films then this won't disappoint.

The bulk of Cold War, Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski's 2018 Academy Award-nominated film, exists in the quiet peripheries.
 "

Pawlikowski may have decent artistic instincts, but those prove entirely inadequate in face of the complex questions bound up with the postwar conditions.

Despite an economical running time, Cold War works through a breathtaking range of emotions lived in the moment, and fateful decisions which must be lived with forevermore.

The result is a film that we respect, even admire, for its technical prowess more than we hold in our hearts. That is unless you hail from Poland, in which case you might get historically emotional.

The Favourite,93,69,audience,"Filme sensacional! O trio Olívia, Rachel e Emma traz adrenalina do início ao fim. Foi uma surpresa muito positiva pra mim."
The Favourite,93,69,audience,Tedious with weird bits thrown in to try to distract from the lack of story. Don't waste your time.
The Favourite,93,69,audience,"Hated it.  I have read a lot of history, and this movie trashes every one of the historical characters portrayed in this film.  The character flaws of the people portrayed, and their lack of redeeming virtues is depressing."
The Favourite,93,69,audience,"I was never a fan of Lanthimos, I always found him too bizarre or cruel to watch. But The Favourite is probably the best film to come out in the last few years. It's an absolute must-see and so full of contradictions: funny but also dark, witty but very emotional at times, a period drama that feels very modern. It's also the ONLY film I've ever watched that is not about one, nor two but three women in power. I guess this makes it rare but also very ""boring"" for some who are used to watching manly rulers."
The Favourite,93,69,audience,"Greek director Giorgos Lanthimos has been known for his very unique kind of filmmaking at least since The Lobster or The Killing Of A Sacred Deer. With his historical drama The Favourite, he has once again taken all kinds of cinematic art to the extreme. In the 18th century, Queen Anne, the first Queen of Britain, is struggling with health problems and the complicated management of a war. Her childhood friend Lady Sarah is always at her side, with the two having a much closer relationship than anyone realises. When Sarah's cousin Abigail hires on as a maid in the royal household, a fierce battle for the Queen's favour ensues between the two. 

The ensemble of The Favourite is brimming with outstanding performances and its strong female leads. Olivia Colman plays the moody Queen Anne in such a way that you can overlook her naivety and slight annoyance. One moment she can be the happiest person on earth, until the next she's suddenly screaming at everyone and dead miserable. Colman eccentrically embodies a woman who is guided mainly by her desires and feelings, and above all is extremely frank in portraying the Queen's physical passion and her desire for attention. She is the fulcrum from which the main plot of the film emerges. That turns out to be the rivalry between Emma Stone's Abigail and Rachel Weisz Lady Sarah. Although the two get along well and even support each other at first, from the point where Abigail vies for the queen's prestige, they stop at no dirty trick. While it is Stone's character you root for at first, the omens change constantly as the story progresses. You never really have any idea with either of them whether they are concerned with greed for power or unconditional affection for the queen. This ambivalence in their characters is brilliantly realised by the actresses, with Weisz in particular standing out. Nicholas Hoult has only a few scenes as the aspiring Prime Minister Harley, but is convincing with enormous charisma every time he is seen.

The Favourite is not your typical historical drama. The film is enormously humorous and self-deprecating, which especially comes to the fore in the sometimes absurd dialogue. The absurdity of the film might be too much for some and also the actually grandiose performance of the actors might seem exaggerated and over the top for many. But if you enjoy productions with a great setting, sometimes irritating but interesting camera work and Hollywood-untypical story elements, The Favourite might just be your cup of tea. Also worth mentioning is the score, which occurs in multiple versions and is probably too much for many, but also has something very unique and special. Also, it's surprising that it's a semi-true story, as it never really feels realistic. The Favourite is definitely not a film for the broad crowd, but a welcome change from the mainstream."

The dialog too was just perfect, the scene with priest at the Asylum so so deep and gives you an understanding that genius so great cannot be appreciated in that life time.

At Eternity's Gate,79,64,audience,"The acting was spot on, but nothing else was. The cinematography was unpleasant to watch due to the shakiness and handheld nature. There was practically no plot at all - Van Gogh does some painting and stumbles around in nature for the majority of the film. Then there was the soundtrack that was just lots of loud, slow piano. I suppose the dialogue was fine, but the film was far from interesting. It's an arty film rather than an entertaining film. However, this isn't even a good piece of art.

Colette,87,69,audience,Enjoyed the experience.
Colette,87,69,audience,"Keira Knightley in a period piece? Seems like a normal thing and she's good at it. Keira Knightley is excellent here. I don't think she can do a bad performance. She lives and breathes every part of Colette. The film has subtle and sly humor and is fairly entertaining throughout. A fantastic Movie about a woman who lived more than a hundred years ago, but living like a woman a hundred years later, free and unrestrained."
Colette,87,69,audience,"This is the true story of a female author whose husband takes credit for her wildly successful novels. It's not so black and white, in that in the beginning, she's totally on board. As the years go by and their relationship changes, so do her feelings about their arrangement. It's complex and interesting. Lots of gray area."
Colette,87,69,audience,A great of Colette's early life from a young naive bride to finally breaking free of the husband who was holding back her development into one of the greatest women writers of her generation and breaking free from patriarchal norms of a hypocritical society. Stunning performance from Knightley!
Colette,87,69,audience,"Directed by Wash Westmoreland. Colette tells the real-life story of Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette during the 1890s. Being a period piece, the film has a fantastic costume and production design that serves the story. The film moves at a moderate pace, which makes the film seem sluggish at times. Keira Knightley and Dominic West have outstanding chemistry throughout the film. The two leads carry the story, and audiences will see a failing marriage that brings out a strong female character—an intriguing watch for sure."
Colette,87,69,audience,"Between 3 and 3.5 stars. One interesting biopic (one of the few, by the way) about a charismatic character who lived a life in continuous change."
Colette,87,69,audience,"Quarantine Movie Review (QMR) #4
Film: Colette
Score: 6/10
Review: Based on the real life events of the very the acclaimed woman author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette or simply ‘Colette'. The movie is a retelling of her life events and her journey and struggle on how she reached at that point in her life. Played by the very charming Keira Knightly, we explore how she rediscovers herself through her writing and how she comes in terms with her new found desires which she develops over the course of the film.
Colette is very delightful film on the surface with beautiful set designs, fancy old French and English people and an overall interesting protagonist. We follow the young and simple French country girl Colette, where she falls in love with a writer of sorts and plans to begin a new life with him. The husband Willy played by Dominic West is a writer of sorts who owns rights to other authors work and sells them under his own name. They have financial troubles in the beginning and he asks Colette to write a story which he could sell, at first he rejects her story, finding flaws in it and calls it very feminine, but as conditions get adverse he publishes it and it turned out to be a really big success. That book was the first ever Claudine novel , ‘'Claudine at School'', it explored womanhood never before seen by a French audience or any audience as a matter of fact in that European era.
Colette is a very simple autobiography of an influential figure from the past, with good acting and a predictable outcome with twists and turns we see beforehand, still it holds well with the interesting subplot having Colette falling in affairs with other women, it represented the LGBTQ community well in this film. With many characters actually supporting that affair and relationship, Colette's husband actually promotes his wife to have those affairs if in turn he gets to do the same as well, an open relationship of sorts.
The movie does have amazing costume designs and really glamorises a 120 year old fashion. Cinematography is done well too, with neat crisp shots and elevating the old timey feeling of it. 
Still the movie is a good time pass where you get to learn a bit of her life, and how writing which was just a hobby for Colette becomes a real influence on the hearts and minds of young girls and ladies all over the world.
6/10"
Colette,87,69,audience,Keira Knightly is the queen of period dramas and Colette is but an addition to her long list of brilliant ones. The film is beautifully shot and has amazing production and costume design but it's undoubtedly Knightly's captivating performance that steals the show. She elevates this simple and unaffecting biopic into a work of art like no other actress could've done.
Colette,87,69,audience,"Historical films are always something great. This story plunge us in the period in France and appear honest to the max. Willy, the husband of Colette, appears as a bit of profiteer first, but he did encourage and allow Colette to succeed. And this story explains a lot modern life."
Colette,87,69,audience,"Hubby and wife watched the slow 'Colette', with a fantastic tour de force effort by Keira Knightley and Dominic West, who play the husband and wife duo based on the true story of French novelist Colette.  Colette is predominately in her 20s for this film.  There was some laziness when it came to the music as one of the songs ""Down by the Salley Gardens"" hadn't been sung until over a decade after the year the scene was in.  Really takes one out of the movie, if you know music.  The songs were a little on the nose.  Songs that tell you exactly how you should feel are annoying.  Specifically wife said, ""The ending wrapped things up nicely, however the pacing was poor.""  Hubby summed things up thusly, ""It's a film that spans the late 19th Century and early 20th, but it's desperate to tell you just how hip it is.  It misses the mark when it comes to period pieces and you'd have to believe the characters are both much more interesting than the script allowed them to be.  For a movie in which the second act centered around sex, there wasn't nearly as much adventure as there could have been.  Safe and unsatisfying without the leads this could have been dreadful.  If only it was written with an eye on the time and not language that could have been said yesterday.""  Hubby: 5.1/Wife: 5.9 Average 5.5/10"

Capturing its period while conveying a powerful contemporary resonance, this biopic of the titular French author finds inspiration in more than its true-life protagonist's literary prowess.

Ultimately, Colette offers an evocative message with [Keira] Knightley providing a career highlight performance. However, its lacklustre direction and dialogue cause it to fall short of being truly inspirational.

 "
The Seagull,67,45,audience,"The Seagull is the latest version of the iconic play by Anton Chekhov. It's hard to fault but also hard to truly love. The pieces are all there, but ultimately it feels like 'do we really need another version?'. The story is set in 1904 in Russia as friends and relatives take to a summer house. The main character is an actress of note. She has a famous playwright lover and a son who is aspiring to be a playwright too. There are tales of unrequited love and regrets on life. The play is classic material and this film does a reasonable job of adapting. The acting power is strong with Saoirse Ronan, Annette Benning and Elizabeth Moss doing their best. It's also very pretty looking but in the end it felt like light entertainment rather than essential."
The Seagull,67,45,audience,"Amorous triangles and quadrangles all theatrically unrequited and lots of very close-ups of Ronin and Bening, then continuous whining, Dennehy who falls asleep and snores, the young protagonist who shoots himself twice. The moviegoer is undecided among which of these behaviors to imitate.
(Mauro Lanari)"
The Seagull,67,45,audience,Annette Benning is wonderful in this (and I am not a normal fan).
The Seagull,67,45,audience,"- There are better ways to woo than by shooting The Seagull -

I'll admit it: I was a Chekhov virgin. So it's fair to say that I approached this film with some trepidation as I wondered if my lack of familiarity with the great Russian playwright's oeuvre would limit my enjoyment or understanding.

I needn't have worried. In hindsight, I was the perfect audience. These Hollywood adaptations of classics seem tailor-made for those of us who have the occasional pretense to ""high culture"" yet are too lazy/busy/out-of-touch to find our way to the ""real thing."" So I was grateful to finally see some Chekhov brought to life by a wonderful cast of actors.

The Seagull takes place on a gorgeous lakeside estate in late 19th century Russia and features a ""privileged class"" of summertime guests as they deal with themes of nostalgia, what it means to be a success, and how to navigate life's inevitable disappointments, while falling in and out of love. And there's an actual seagull in there, too - it's not just a metaphor.

Now, let me see if I can get this straight: Nina (Saoirse Ronan), the young innocent wannabe actress loves Konstantin (Billy Howle, Dunkirk), a local writer frustrated by his lack of recognition. His mother, Irina (Annette Bening), a revered actress, who is one of the most amusingly vain people I've ever seen on screen, comes to visit with her younger lover, the famous novelist Boris Trigorin (Corey Stoll, House of Cards). Naturally, things get strained when Boris and Nina start spending more time together than either of their partners would prefer. Oh, and then there's Masha (Elisabeth Moss, The Handmaid's Tale), the delightfully depressive daughter of the estate steward who pines for Konstantin while ignoring the adoration of hapless teacher Mikhail (Michael Zegen).

But never mind the convolutions of the plot, or your head'll spin. What really stood out here were the wonderful performances. Annette Bening, Corey Stoll, and Elisabeth Moss, in particular, excelled. Current hot property (with at least four films in the past year) Saoirse Ronan (Lady Bird, On Chesil Beach) is compelling in her initial naivete, but I think I'm just more drawn to the complexities of the older characters and their more salient (for me, at least) struggles. The film is worth seeing just for the heartbreaking scene where Irina, painfully aware that society considers her ""past it,"" both professionally and as a lover, pleads with Boris not to confirm her worst fears (whilst she in turn all but ignores the needs of her suicidal son), or for Masha's many witty proclamations on the pointless misery of love: ""I am going to tear this love out of my heart...I'll get married.""

Cinematically, the film is pretty (I'll credit that mainly to the location), but fairly unremarkable. There are some distracting focusing choices in places and Michael Mayer's direction often feels more like a ""Sunday Theatre"" TV movie. It tries its best to make the leap from the physical constraints of a play to the open palette of the screen, but some of the decisions in this regard seem to be trying a little too hard. For example, we open with a dramatic near-death scene in a Moscow theatre before flashing back to the main rural story - a trope that's way overused these days and strikes me as indicating a lack of confidence in the material or the audience.

But, ultimately, The Seagull is a tasty celebration of the Russian spirit (as interpreted by Hollywood) - full of joy, humanity, reveling in its passions, but with a juicy undercurrent of bleak, nihilistic commentary on love, ambition, and desire.

The Seagull,67,45,audience,"The cast is good, but this is just further proof that Chekhov belongs on the stage. Also, there are some weird structural choices that undermine the play's natural tension."
The Seagull,67,45,audience,"As other reviewers have mentioned, there's better adaptations of this classic Anton Chekhov play, but with its all-star cast I did find enough drama here to keep me engaged throughout. Somehow, the characters here did not have a powerful effect on me, thus 3 stars is the highest I would rate it."
The Seagull,67,45,audience,Great cast/acting but not much more to say as this adaption of the renowned play felt like the definition of meh.
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
I didn't hate The Seagull. I just forgot about it quickly after I left the theater. Like the love between two people in this world, the desire I had wasn't really genuine or strong enough to care about what happened next to these characters.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
It's fairly easy to suspend disbelief, since the characters are deeply realistic and uncomfortably relatable.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
Sadly, this version of the story is dull and spineless despite a few actors who are truly trying to bring something to life.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
If everyone played with [Elizabeth Moss'] brio and depth, if the characters weren't reduced to bare outlines, and if the film itself were less self-conscious about taking up people's time... Chekhov would be better served.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
One wishes that the film, which clocks in at a brisk 98 minutes, had slowed down and given the actors a bit more space. Even if the complicated brew of emotions cannot always match Chekhov's, there are still moments of great power here.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
Bening, who has developed into an acting bird of Streep-like plumage, enjoys herself enormously as Arkadina.
 "

""The Seagull"" does not take off and fly.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
Feels somehow staid and safe, robbed of its natural theatrically and trapped by the confines of its own frame.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
Such a waste of talent and effort.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
As emotionally heaving and handsomely staged as it all is - and, crucially, never beholden to stage conventions - the end result often feels like a box-ticking exercise in meeting the requisite marks.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
Bening is on great form as Irina, for whom all the world's a stage, its boards to be trod only in full make-up and costume. Moss is hugely entertaining as the black-clad, drinking, smoking Masha, haunting the estate like a bad-tempered, stomping spectre.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
This is the rare play adaptation that is able to cast off its stage shackles.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
The impressive cast manages to convey the subtleties and nuances of their roles, it's beautifully shot and there's a lively pace throughout.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
The English-speaking cast gives the film a contemporary feel while Mayer uses the camera fluidly to avoid the perception that you're watching a play. This is by far the best cinematic adaptation to date.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
Take away the boredom, melancholy and frustration, and you have a more fluent movie but a less faithful representation of the writer's world.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
If The Seagull sounds like it would make a much better play than a film then you would be correct.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
The trifecta of brilliant women leads (Bening, Moss and Ronan), all doing a superb job, somehow doesn't quite alleviate the feeling that we are not going deep enough.
 "
The Seagull,67,45,critic,"
It is a credit to Bening that while she, too, plays the excessively vain Irina ""big"", her screen-time provides the best moments in an otherwise middling affair.

The Guardians,93,55,audience,"C'est un film tres beau
I find the negative audience reviews here for this beautiful film hugely disappointing. Freeze almost any frame and you find a work of art. And the story is beautifully and tacitly developed. Much is done by facial expression and incidentals rather than overt obvious dialogue - and I find this adds to the film's beauty and impact. Nathalie Baye (Hortense) is perfect in her part as the matriarch of the family farm. And I don't find this to be a feminist film at all. The women have to manage the farm themselves simply because the men are away in a wart that will inevitably damage them. Hortense's love for her two boys shines convincingly when she meets them off the train when they are on leave. My favourite scene is Hortense and her daughter Solange leaning on a fence towards the end of the film - they even look like mother and daughter."

The Guardians,93,55,audience,"Men are fairly useless seems to be the message. first noted when the husband of the matriarch pets his dog, smokes cigs, and makes moonshine while madam is plowing the fields. granted, the old man has gnarled fingers and a cane. yes, war seems to damage the yougner men here...but they seem to have character flaws to star with as becomes more and more apparent. the daugher/wife of one manages to purchase a tractor, while maman saves up and purchases a thrasher. one gets the feeling were the men to have remained in charge, nothing would have changed. but then again, isn't that why we're watching this movie? to be transported to a time when physical labor in the great outdoors is a way of life, the gorgeous french countryside. as for maman matriarch throwing the maid -- the film's protagonist -- ""under the bus"" is harder for me to figure out. the maid calls her a monster, and this would seem to be an accurate assessment. as beautiful as the cinematography is...life was brutal underneath the genteel surface. and maman's grieving a son You would have though made her more compassionate toward her grandson (won't spoils this any further0. anway...women are stronger than callow men in this drama. the ending was happy (i think). and i WAS SO RELIEVED that the movie did not devolve into the story of A SINGLE MOTHER TURNed PROSTITUTE TO SUPPORT HER CHILD WHO THEN IS TAKEN AWAY. NONE OF THAT. THE MAID PROVES THE STRONGEST OF ALL...AND POSSIBLY THE MOST MORAL. BECASUE MADAM MATRIARCH IS AS QUOTED ""A MONSTER."" AND SO THE BABY'S FATHER. GOOD RIDDANCE."

Chappaquiddick,81,68,audience,"Chappaquiddick is a routine movie - a mildly entertaining political drama that, although well made, is strangely humdrum and lacking in tension given its source material. Those familiar with the scandal and unanswered questions might be disappointed to find the movie doesn't bring anything new to the table. The Kennedy's have inspired numerous movies and TV Shows over the decades that are more interesting, cover bigger events and involve more significant members of the family - this movie fails to escape their shadow and feels small by comparison."
Chappaquiddick,81,68,audience,"This movie's slickly made with excellent performances, but such a sober, unexcited depiction of the events, it doesn't reveal more than the facts already known."
Chappaquiddick,81,68,audience,"This movie was fine. It served its purpose in telling the story it wanted to tell, but it didn't really bring up any new perspectives or change minds on any preconceived notions of what happened. Its a way to pass the afternoon, especially if you, like me, have a mother obsessed with the Kennedys. If you thought this looked interesting, or if you don't already know the story, you'll probably enjoy it."
Chappaquiddick,81,68,audience,Its not that anyone does anything wrong with the film (outside of some historical inaccuracies) but  Chappaquiddick is such a disturbing and revolting topic that there is no reason to dramatize it. The way Teddy got away with this makes me sick but there wasn't enough to the story to make this film.
Chappaquiddick,81,68,audience,"I rather enjoyed 'Chappaquiddick'.

I wasn't actually aware of the real life situation before now, my American political knowledge doesn't delve too deep to be honest; so therefore I have no idea how much of it is accurate, I'm sure it's mostly opinion vs. opinion as always with these type of productions. What I can say, though, is that it's a pretty good film.

Jason Clarke is impressive as Ted Kennedy, my opinions of Clarke differ based on a few performances but this is one of the best I've seen from him. I connected to his character, his delivery is spot on throughout.

Ed Helms, who it's pleasing to see something different from, works well in the role of Joe, but Jim Gaffigan (Paul) feels a little out of place in a couple of scenes. It would've been nice if the rest of the cast were more memorable, only Clancy Brown's Robert instantly springs to mind.

Loved the cinematography thoroughly, the dialogue is strong while it captures the gravity of events impeccably. It's a film that is certainly worth your time."

Chappaquiddick,81,68,audience,"Piercing the veil of perfection that the Kennedy dynasty had established (and largely maintained), Chappaquiddick is most powerful as an exploration of the amorality that takes hold in the face of fear and greed, which is only capitalized and further motivated by status.

Friday, July 18, 1969: Apollo 11 is about to land on the moon and Senator Edward Kennedy is about to crash and burn.

Clarke's performance is strong, saddled with layers of pain and regret, and the script by Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan mines some fascinating political drama out of the story.

Final Portrait,73,49,audience,Such a delightful film about the vagaries of the artistic mind and how incomprehensible that mind is to a person who doesn't see with the same vision. Loved it--a real tour d' force of Hammer and Rush playing off one another!
Final Portrait,73,49,audience,"Story, a total waste of your time. Acting, great. That's why there is a star. A bit cruel as Armie and Geoffrey were both great actors. But it needed a better story."
Final Portrait,73,49,audience,"Slow burn study on the artistic and creative process, with precise and enjoyable performances. "
Final Portrait,73,49,audience,"Overall, I found this film positive. The biggest highlights are watching an outstanding portrayal of Alberto from Geoffrey Rush and witnessing a dramatic story of unexpected friendship. The directional choices for some of the filming and editing ended up becoming a bigger distraction to certain key moments to the story. 

- Finesse Movie Reviews"
Final Portrait,73,49,audience,"Geoffrey Rush, Armie Hammer, and Clemence Poesy are wasted in this boring film.  The film runs 90 minutes.  It feels like 90 hours.  A Swiss painter living in Paris is painting a portrait of a journalist.  The painter paints, smokes, swears, and starts over; paints smokes, seas, and starts over, paints, smokes, swears, and starts over.  Nothing of any interest occurs.  Easily one of the most boring films I ever have sat through.  How I wish I had followed the urge to bail on this after about the first ten minutes.  I stupidly kept thinking something of interest was going to happen.  This is based on real life painter and sculpture Alberto Giacometti whose ""art"" is as bad as this film."
Final Portrait,73,49,audience,"Very good acting led by Rush, Hammer, and Shalhoub. However, be prepared for a film that can be trying at times with its disjointed storyline and most deliberate pacing. For me, the subtle humor and eccentric, unpredictable, and full of life characters made it worth the experience."
Final Portrait,73,49,audience,I enjoyed this look into the life of an artist. I particularly enjoyed views of his studio and his interactions with his American friend. But I didn't much care for his selfish and egotistical behavior and the abysmal way he treated his wife. The film seems to me to be a pretty honest account of Giacometti's final years.
Final Portrait,73,49,audience,"This film is a slow study of the madness that is repetitious perfectionism by someone who is neither mad nor perfect. Geoffrey Rush carries the emotional torment well while Arnie Hammer is forced to checkmate his painter's moves.  With a pleasant surprise, Tony Shalhoub plays the tempered brother who rides sidecar to Giacometti's creative vortex. I really enjoyed this film for Tucci's gift of ponderance, poise, and placent appreciation of film making and a glimpse into the head of most artists i've known. It's not for everyone but offers something different in a world of superhero mashups."
Final Portrait,73,49,audience,If you want a movie that will put you to sleep this one will do it. I'm glad it was only 90 minutes long.
Final Portrait,73,49,audience,"its agonizing to watch the creative process...Armie Hammer's role was a total throw-away. Not a movie you want to watch again, but the Giacometti signature is all over the painting by the end of the film."
Final Portrait,73,49,critic,"
Final Portrait leaves the viewer with the feeling that he or she might as well have caught it on TV. And for a movie about a great painter and sculptor, this is not a recommendation.
 "

Final Portrait is enlightening, amusing, thrilling and sometimes touching, with Rush and Hammer forming the perfect artistic odd couple.

 "
Final Portrait,73,49,critic,"
Writer-director Stanley Tucci clearly had a vision and the skills necessary to tell this story, along with actors who are completely captivating as they give their all. But without something to say, the result is about as interesting as a blank canvas.
 "
Final Portrait,73,49,critic,"
Tucci's ideas, together with Rush's acting abilities, were enough to minimally shape the artist, but this biographical drama has no place among the best I've seen lately.
 "
Final Portrait,73,49,critic,"
Under the watchful eye of director Stanley Tucci, Final Portrait is filled with an undercurrent of humor throughout -- crisply paced, allowing its two lead actors the chance to really sink into their respective roles.

Double Lover,70,49,audience,"Yet another shoddy French movie with perverse sex scenes strung together in the hope the audience won't notice the lack of writing or so-called story. If the easily (or perversely) pleased can find anything to like or respect about this low trash, then they can also be regarded as in the same class as this French dud. Another for SBS' growing stockpile of smutty foreign movies to add to their junk heap - that only they could justify putting to air."
Double Lover,70,49,audience,"The French film 'Double Lover' is an erotic thriller from the complex mind of François Ozon, who wrote and directed.  I loved this movie until I didn't, but other than the last five minutes it's entirely worth your time and who knows perhaps the ending will work for you!  It's a film fascinated with twins and it's shot exquisitely and keeps you thinking during the entire runtime.  It's most certainly a film you know you're either going to be into or out the door within about twenty minutes.  It's not for everyone. And that ending, sheesh. Final Score: 7.6/10"
Double Lover,70,49,audience,"Only since 1919 the literature on Doppelganger has become synonymous with disturbing effect and mental destabilization: since Freud published precisely ""Das Unheimliche"" (""The Uncanny""). In reality this effect occurs exclusively in subjects with unconscious conflicting desires, otherwise, if these conflicts are managed in full consciousness and awareness, the effect is not given. That's why the little twin sisters of ""Shining"" can reappear to me as much as they want and I will continue to perceive them as a deadlock in the narrative.  An interminable filmography has been created on the subject, and my apathetic reaction has always remained the same. Ozon tries to mix the cards oscillating between the psychic and the biological: a sort of remake of ""Dead Ringers"" (1988) but from the perspective of ""The Fly"" (1986). And I insist on getting bored, with a softcore full of the nasty nudes of the androgyne Marine Vacht (while I'm heterosexual: ""Well, nobody's perfect"").
(Mauro Lanari)"
Double Lover,70,49,audience,"Freudian, French, sexy, surprising."
Double Lover,70,49,audience,"If the 2 leads were not so goodlooking, no one would believe the story. Ozon has done better."
Double Lover,70,49,audience,"Not nearly as smart as it thinks it is

From prolific French auteur Francois Ozon, L'amant double [Double Lover] is partly a study of sexual obsession, partly an oneiric mystery (think Neil Jordan's In Dreams), and partly a conventional thriller (more whoisit than whodunnit). ""Freely adapted"" from Joyce Carol Oates's 1987 novel Lives of the Twins (published under the pseudonym Rosamond Smith), and written by Ozon and Philippe Piazzo, the film tells the story of Chloe (Marine Vacth), a woman with a fragile mental state, who falls passionately in love with her psychoanalyst, Paul (Jeremie Renier). Within a few months, she has moved in, however, as time goes by, she slowly starts to learn of a significant part of his identity which he has been concealing.

Imagine, if you will, Vertigo (1958) remade by someone like Gaspar Noe or Lars von Trier, and you'd be some way towards getting a handle on Ozon's latest; completely barmy (you know you're in strange territory when the second shot of a movie is, quite literally, an internal shot of a vagina). As one would expect from Ozon, the aesthetics are solid - the film is built upon an inventive visual style employing juxtaposition, pseudo-split screen, and copious amounts of shots with one person in the frame proper, and the person to whom they're talking only visible in reflection. The sound effects are also excellent and really jolt you out of your seat on a couple of occasions. Similarly, the acting is strong, with both Vacth and Renier unrecognisable in their respective roles.

However, the melodramatic and self-congratulatory plot is an absolute mess. Many of Ozon's standard tropes are here; a dissection of the academic middle class/intelligentsia, an examination of the schism between appearance and reality, an attempt to elucidate the mind of a complex woman, a psychoanalytical bedrock, the mutability of identity etc. But it's all diffused through an utterly farcical narrative, which fails to get even the basics right. For example, sex is a central theme, but by the time we get to the fourth or fifth sex scene, it has completely lost its potency (compare, for example, the infinitely superior La vie d'Adele - Chapitres 1 & 2 (2013), where sexuality is just as central, but which features only two sex scenes). The same goes for the increasingly ridiculous plot twists, once you get to three or four and you're still in the first half of the movie, you just stop caring. Ozon has always been hit and miss, for every Sitcom (1998) and Swimming Pool (2003), there's an Angel (2007) and a Ricky (2009), and L'amant double is, in the end, a rather pointless film that seems to think it's saying something exceptionally profound about desire and identity. It isn't."
Double Lover,70,49,audience,"Very bizarre thriller which starts as a psychological movie , than a romance movie than ends up as a suspense and horror movie...Several genres in one...Entertaining..."
Double Lover,70,49,audience,Mucho de Polanski y Hitchcock.
Double Lover,70,49,audience,"Subversive, thought-provoking and kinky to a fault, Double Lover is every bit the Francois Ozon film you love."
Double Lover,70,49,audience,"This film, based on a Joyce Carol Oates novel (written under a pen name), is so bizarre from start to finish. From the shocking opening sequence, to Jacqueline Bisset, to the twisty ending, it’s hard to say how I feel about this psychosexual thriller. It was well acted and held my attention but also seemed kinda ridiculous. Maybe it’s just very French?"
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
An obvious low point for François Ozon...
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
François Ozon's latest is breathless with virtually every motif bleeding sexuality or psychosis, even if it doesn't quite know when to quit.

 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
Like much of Ozon's oeuvre, Double Lover is as visually pristine as its subject matter is depraved, but here the kinky psychological angle simply feels banal.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
A Freudian would have a field day with the film's blatant symbolism (circular stairwells, stuffed cats, and so on), while the kinky eroticism could be a therapist's wet dream.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
Everything falls apart completely at the final reveal, with a maddening twist cheapening the whole film immensely and rendering the story an even sillier exercise than it initially seems.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
Double Lover is a great return to psychosexual territory that Ozon is known for and it is an entertainingly juicy time for erotica lovers.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
With echoes of Cronenberg's Dead Ringers, Ozon has pieced together a compelling and highly entertaining puzzle piece.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
If Double Lover had even one-eighth of the cinematic zest of one of Brian De Palma's Hitchcock knockoffs, this might have been more than a perverse diversion.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
If you're not going to even try pulling a fast one on us, then why bother even make a psychosexual erotic thriller at all? Just put on a pot of tea and crack open the marmalade, why don't you?
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
It's a visual joy to see Ozon's beautifully composed shots.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
Double Lover's lava lamp surrealism is enjoyably hollow. One could imagine a midnight movie audience finding plenty of dirty comfort in its warped sensibilities and gratuitous image stacking.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
This is a very cool, very Gallic, and very opaque Basic Instinct, and if it's ultimately only partly satisfying, it's still incredibly absorbing and a lot of fun.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
If there is rather more surface than substance and the ending is signposted, it is a surface full of intricacy and a signpost of admirable elegance.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
And from that promising but slightly tired opening stanza, Double Lover quickly descends into a psychodrama of such committed dementedness I found myself liking it a great deal more than I probably should have.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
You've got to admire Ozon for presenting a frivolous film with such a serious approach, but it's easy to miss that he's in on the joke. Double Lover should be viewed with a smirk.
 "
Double Lover,70,49,critic,"
A genre film taking a woman to the extremes of sanity while always honouring her emotions, L'Amant Double is a bold and often disturbing spectacle.

Happy End,69,54,audience,"An upper class family in Calais struggles with crisis. Although this film is of an obvious high caliber production, the lack of a coherent plot left it much to be desired. Either I'm not that smart or this movie made no sense. Given that this was a French film and perhaps much was lost in translation, the story was difficult, at best, to comprehend. There was no real beginning and no real end. It is not wrapped up in a nice little bow and for most films, it doesn't really have to be. However there was such a lack of explanation pertaining to the characters actions  there was nothing for the viewer to grasp as reasoning. The best thing about this film was its ability to make yourself feel good about your own family. As crazy as you may think your family is, this one is crazier and not funny haha crazy. but perhaps it was meant to be crazy. Critics love this film, the general public probably does not. CritPop score of a 2 of 5 stars."
Happy End,69,54,audience,Otra vez Heneke y sus estilachos.
Happy End,69,54,audience,"The critics were unfairly harsh on this characteristically opaque examination of family secrets, betrayal and the mysteries of life. It's not an easy film to follow, at least initially, Haneke doesn't hold your hand or spell everything out, but that approach pays growing dividends as the onion is slowly unpeeled. Marvellous acting from his ensemble cast, led by Matthieu Kassovitz, Isabelle Huppert and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Fantastique."
Happy End,69,54,audience,"Director Michael Haneke's latest film, his first in five years, is a chilly look at the moral failings of the bourgeoisie (or perhaps the upper class).  Isabelle Huppert is the neurotic head of a construction company, hoping to bestow this role on her son, who she constantly berates for not being good enough (an accident at one of the sites heightens this tension).  Mathieu Kassovitz is her brother, a surgeon, whose 13-year-old daughter by a first marriage (Fantine Harduin) is suddenly added to the family when her mother attempts suicide; the daughter immediately senses that her father is having an affair (and investigates this on his computer; her smartphone is always near at hand, recording things).  Jean-Louis Trintignant (now in his 80s) plays the retired head of the family, alternatively forgetful and lucidly perceptive; he seeks escape in death after having euthanised his wife several years earlier during a chronic illness (a nod to Haneke's previous feature, Amour, 2012).  There is no linear plot to reveal; we just see the family with its various players rolling through a series of events that show their obliviousness to the suffering of the world (made a bit more overt when the son invites a group of African refugees into a fancy engagement dinner).  We do feel the tension from these events but it is enhanced by the characters' inability to communicate with each other, to confess their own true feelings or to recognise those of each other.  (Haneke uses some cinematic tricks, such as filming from a distance so that we cannot hear what is being said, to emphasise these failures). Our social pain may be even more acute when we observe the poor tween daughter and her own constricted emotions, clearly borne of the treatment received from those around her.  As always with Haneke, there are ideas to chew on here but they seem slightly less well digested than in some of his other films."
Happy End,69,54,audience,am vazut doar prima jumate in aer liber.
Happy End,69,54,audience,"Haneke has served us so many great films that his newst efforts are always something to give a peep. Here he is back after the magnificent ""Amore"" and also brought some of the same actors in Jean-Louis Trintignant and Isabelle Huppert.

There are some interesting shots here, some of them done with cell phones. It takes quite some time to get a grip of the stoy as there are many people involve and we see parts from all of they're lives. When the needed connecting-bit comes throgh you feel the whole story and you feel you know everyone pretty well.

There's not much happiness here. Everyone seem self-destructive no matter if they are 13, 90 or 40 years of age. OK acting but for me Fantine Harduin as the 13 year old ""Eve"" is the most impressive acress here. Some cool scenes, like the great karaokee scene, but other scenes are not bring that much to the table. It's like a bunch of short clips, they all plays important parts but I never really dig them.

Part experimental, part boring, part solid. The result is fresh, but not fresh enough, hard hitting but never hard enough and I was left disappointed even if I liked the way the film made me feel like an observer like few other films do.

6 out of 10 cell phones."
Happy End,69,54,audience,"Haneke does what he knows best, deconstructing the upper-middle class family, although the truth is, he's done that before with better results."
Happy End,69,54,audience,"The more foreign films I watch, the more I worry that due to my being entrenched in American culture, I have a hard time relating to the dialogue and way of life of many characters within the films. I fear that this causes me to generalize and say that all the Austrian movies I've seen are similar, for example. Or the same about French films. Or any other country for that matter. I have come to realize that what I recognize is a director's style, perhaps moreso than when I watch an American produced film. Therefore this cultural gap has a real plus side: witnessing the film's director at their fullest, without any cultural bias. 
The more I see of Michael Haneke (coincidentally the only Austrian director's films I have seen), the more I'm sure he's just an evil genius. Much like with Ruben Ostlund's The Square (another film I love though may not review), I left Happy End with little bias, but with a full force message in front of me. The Square has a jovial message, Happy End has one that makes its title sting. 
Drenched in modern technology and set against an unmistakably non-american family backdrop, you find out just how much a story told in a different culture can amplify a message. No American movie could ever have (so maliciously) proven the point that Haneke sets out to prove. For the sake of letting you experience its overwhelming dread without spoilers, I will say nothing of the message other than that if you have never seen a Michael Haneke movie, don't let this be your first. If you have seen one, bask in the glory of Happy End. I will repeat, for any curious reader, Michael Haneke (director of dread fests such as Amour, Cache and Funny Games) is an evil genius. Evil. This movie's title is the only Happy thing about it, but again, the movie's message comes barreling in like a ton of bricks. It's impact? Not for the faint of heart. A film for film lovers and people willing to ponder over an uncompromising plot. Though Happy End did not destroy me the way Amour did in 2012, it's a welcome little feast of objective, unrelenting nihilism. AS ONLY HANEKE CAN DELIVER! Also of note, acting is top notch, and the use of technology is riveting, including shots of a vertical phone screen that only use up ~20% of the screen. Superb, and every Haneke fan should agree!"
Happy End,69,54,audience,Nobody can make films about people who are slowly dying on the inside like Michael Haneke.
Happy End,69,54,audience,"The film didn't completely impress me, but I still liked it.This is another good example of Haneke's distinctive filmmaking style  and solid principles.Its mood and tone is tragic and bleak, in the way that only this master of world cinema is able to create.The ending was one of the most affecting and orginal final scenes I've ever seen."

Foxtrot,94,76,audience,"If there was ever a film that was elevated by the final scene, 'Foxtrot' is it.  Four countries collaborated to make it, but it's an Israeli picture in Hebrew.  This is such a slow burn I had to rewatch a few scenes as the movie lost me a couple times in how it floats from time period to time period.  The film's disjointed nature initially struck me as a poor choice, but as I sit here this film keeps finding a way back into my mind.  The last scene is a culmination of so many things.  This may be a tough one to stay with, but if you do it's to your benefit.  Final Score: 7/10"
Foxtrot,94,76,audience,"I started to watch this movie just for a ""tick"" on my movie list, because my girlfriend recommended it to me, but my god was I amazed. This is the real drama I have been trying to look for, but, it will be hard to understand for many people. Some may call it propaganda, but I would call it a movie about an importance of human's life. I don't know who any of these actors are, but they are doing a really good job to express their emotions and to make the viewer believe in what they are saying and what they are doing. A great story about surviving the loss of a child. Besides the operator's job not being outstanding, it is good. The soundtrack in such a movie is something that doesn't matter, as only thing that matters is the dialogue, which in this movie is very very well written. I recommend to watch this movie for a watch to anyone who is a fan of drama genre, likes thought provoking movies and is bored of Hollywood cinema. I rarely find foreign language films so entertaining, an absolute 10/10."
Foxtrot,94,76,audience,"A riveting film with plenty of emotional highs and lows.  The subtitles were easy to follow, unlike some films where I have trouble keeping up with the dialogue."
Foxtrot,94,76,audience,"So boring, I've watched it in double speed, but it's still so slow and boring."
Foxtrot,94,76,audience,"Foxtrot is a structurally weird film that is strong in all of its three very different segments, but it needed a better connective tissue and more purpose as a whole. The performance from Lior Ashkenazi is truly phenomenal as he brought every emotion successfully while the movie is also well shot and, again, intriguingly conceptualized, but thematically rather lacking."
Foxtrot,94,76,audience,The grief is perhaps a little too extreme but there is a lyricism and gentleness to the film on its political observation.
Foxtrot,94,76,audience,"I three part story with an epilogue about a family in Israel who has a son serving in the Israeli military. The story is beset with ripples and effects that come together in a nicely well thought out plot. The raw edge of emotions at home are a sharp contrast to the mundane routine of soldiers life. Acting is well done and characters seem appropriately cast. This movie will catch the eye of most if not all professional critics and most genpop who would be interested in foreign films. The language is Hebrew. 
Our CritPop score is a 4 out of 5"
Foxtrot,94,76,audience,Turned it off when the man kicked his dog...garbage barbarism
Foxtrot,94,76,audience,"""Foxtrot"" is a gorgeous piece of cinema smartly structured in three sections, and all of them are real, powerful and hauntingly beautiful. A film that dances with dramatic moments and something like magic realism. One of those film that you are bound to remember for a long time after viewing. In other words: a masterpiece."
Foxtrot,94,76,audience,"A fascinating political allegory 

Part satirical allegory, part surrealist indictment, Foxtrot finds writer/director Samuel Maoz working with similar themes as he did in Lebanon (2009), especially the ridiculous nature of war and the meaninglessness of giving one's life in the service of one's country. However, whereas Lebanon was set entirely in a Centurion tank, Foxtrot expands Moaz's thematic concerns to take in the grief and anguish of those who have lost children to military service. Much like Lebanon, Foxtrot is an intensely political film, and much like Lebanon, it has met with controversy in Israel, where it has been accused of slandering the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). As aesthetically impressive as it is politically divisive, the film is a savage condemnation of both a national psyche and a military mindset that trades on the most binary of them-versus-us dichotomies.

Divided into three distinct sections, the film tells the story of Michael Feldman (a superb Lior Ashkenazi), who learns that his son Jonathan, a conscript in the IDF, has been killed ""in the line of duty"", only to learn several hours later that a mistake had been made and Jonathan is alive and well. The film then jumps several days back to a forlorn desert checkpoint on Israel's northern border (codename Foxtrot) manned by a group of wet-behind-the-ears soldiers, including Jonathan (Yonaton Shiray). The most action the group see is raising the barrier to let a camel amble through and checking the IDs of the few Palestinians who pass by. Without spoiling anything, the third section, which is kind of an extended coda, then returns to the Feldman apartment six months after the opening scenes.

In Foxtrot, Maoz uses allegory to deconstruct Israeli national myths. Interrogating what he sees as a culture of denial born from a reluctance to deal with the morality and sustainability of being an occupying force, the film gets a lot of mileage out of the metaphor of the foxtrot - a dance where no matter where you go, if you follow the steps correctly, you end up back at the starting point. Maoz is suggesting that without taking great care, countries will repeat the errors of the past, ending up exactly where they once were. Speaking to the Globe and Mail, Maoz explains, ""Foxtrot deals with the open wound or bleeding soul of Israeli society. We dance the foxtrot; each generation tries to dance it differently but we all end up at the same starting point.""

In a more concrete sense, in a scene at Foxtrot, the film examines the casual sadism and unspoken racism that can arise from serving in the armed forces of a country perpetually at war. Making a Palestinian couple stand in the pouring rain whilst their antiquated computer checks the couple's IDs, the soldiers don't care that they couple are dressed for a formal night, or that by the time they are cleared, their clothes are destroyed, as is her hair, and makeup. The scene is brilliantly staged, agonisingly realistic, and takes place in real-time, with Maoz concentrating on the couple looking at one another across the roof of the car, conveying agonised helplessness, compromised innocence, and, most saliently, abject humiliation. It's a masterclass in dialogue-free storytelling, and deeply political storytelling at that.

Aesthetically, Maoz shoots each of the three sections differently; the first is restrictive, trapping us in the confined headspace of the Feldmans, with the intense emotionality constantly threatening to boil over; the vast wide-open vistas of the second part contrast sharply with the confinement of the first, with the entire section threaded through with surrealism; the third section is darker than the others (in a literal sense), with a stark visual design that emphasises only those elements that are important to the scene. The Feldman apartment itself is extremely angular, and although it's very spacious, cinematographer Giora Bejach shoots it in such a way as to appear oppressively box-like.

Foxtrot won't be for everyone. Some will take issue with the pacing (which, it has to be said, is extremely languid), some with the allegorical nature of the story, some with the film's politics. For everyone else, however, this is a brilliantly realised tragedy, dealing with the randomness of pain and loss in a country refusing to recognise its past. Critiquing the xenophobic mindset that has crept into the Israeli zeitgeist, Maoz has been accused of making an ""anti-Israel narrative."" On the contrary, he is pleading with his country to change its ways, or it will repeat the errors of history. This is the act of a man who loves his country deeply, but who can see its flaws."
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
...a tricky narrative that is occasionally over-hyperbolic...

Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Maoz never lets us forget about the bigger picture.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Foxtrot benefits from a talented supporting cast.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
[Writer-director Samuel] Moaz is a daring, unpredictable storyteller, and his eccentric plot construction, which also takes into account the son's last days, turns an intimate emotional drama into a larger statement about fate and justice.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
The absolute precision of the film's construction, from sound, to production design, to cinematography, to the performances is exquisite, and painful because of it.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
For a film with only three characters, Foxtrot contains a lot of twists and turns. Right up until the bitterly cruel final scene, it never stops surprising. Or perhaps it's a wickedly funny final scene. It's a matter of perspective.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
A heavy-handed approach to the futility of war, Foxtrot aims high but falls short
 "

It's a clever, funny, unsettling film.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
A film full of mystery and switchbacks is resolved in resounding style.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Its intensity is too artfully channelled ever to turn into poignancy.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
The film's tastefully constricted aesthetic is enjoyably at odds with its unruly, philosophical themes; the slipperiness of a dual identity, the fragility of war and the relentless manner in which grief can leak into a home's every crevice.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Foxtrot is a cinematic delight with a profound message at its heart and many striking shots that resonate long after the final credits roll.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Hellerian surrealism. Slapstick comedy. There are many tones and textures set against two backdrops in Samuel Maoz's long-awaited follow-up to Lebanon.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Maoz definitely knows how to knock a film together, so fingers crossed that the window between this and his next one is a lot more narrow.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Foxtrot excels at showing the tedium and dehumanizing effects of military deployment.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
A beautifully shot and ambitiously crafted film about the absurdities of life in Israel.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Maoz's writing is matched every step of the way by his direction, and Foxtrot is a properly visionary work.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Maoz creates a deadpan J'accuse, razor-edged and hugely original. The truth? It is unmissable.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Before the retrospective letdown, there is an exhilarating kind of disorientation as we move from one narrative section to the next.
 "
Foxtrot,94,76,critic,"
Maoz's masterful, intelligent feature shows how war can challenge a decent family unit, while hollow rhetoric destroys its spirit. A salutary film that eschews gimmickry or empty sloganeering, Foxtrot deserves to be seen.

The Square,85,71,audience,"This movie its a big satire of modern society and specially art coated in a drama narrative. 
The only minor complaint may be that there are many questions that are left unanswered. Also many themes are explored and some feel like they didn't reach a satisfactory conclusion or explored to a big degree. The movie it's by construction pretentious, it's aware of it and does clever things with this.

The question that this movie explored that left me more interested is : 
What makes something Art?  

Many other questions arise from this.
Just as explained in the movie, the Museum automatically turns anything inside it to Art? Movies turn every sequence or frame into art?
Festivals turn movies into art? 

A movie that raises questions and keeps me thinking after the movie has ended for me its a big win."
The Square,85,71,audience,Very funny satire of the ostentatious art world. Great gags and super awkward!
The Square,85,71,audience,A waste of 2 1/2 hours.
The Square,85,71,audience,"Artsy-fartsy movies are very hit or miss for me. Artsy-fartsy movies about art are almost always going to be a no. Enter The Square, a movie about an art curator who is preparing to launch his next exhibit called…The Square. I wish I could simply tell you to just not watch the movie, but I need to tell you why so here goes…

Acting: 10
How phenomenal is Elisabeth Moss? I appreciate the roles she takes on and I appreciate the obvious time and energy she puts into each. While she is supporting here, I certainly felt the most impact from her role. Sure Claes Bang was solid in the lead role as Christian, but this movie would have been damn near unbearable without Moss. The acting definitely didn't hinder the success of this movie.

Beginning: 4

Characters: 9

Cinematography/Visuals: 9
For all of its flaws, the movie is at the very least gorgeous. I loved the dark and ominous tones throughout that represented a certain foreshadowing. Bright colors and shadows are played with perfectly. Director Ruben Ostlund does a magnificent job of creating an off-putting effect that casts a cloud over the movie (in a good way).

Conflict: 5

Entertainment Value: 3
From the beginning of this movie to its lackluster conclusion, I was just bored throughout. Like really bored. Like ""When does this end? Oh my God, it's almost 2 1/2 hours!"" bored. Moss was great, but she wasn't enough to save a work of art that is so boring and unmoving. Snoozefest.

Memorability: 3
Sure the Human Monkey Scene stands out as something to remember, but even that ultimately became annoying after watching three minutes of it. Nothing stood out in the entire 142 minutes of The Square. It suffers from no edification or value overall.

Pace: 5

Plot: 4

Resolution: 2

Overall: 54
Rule of Thumb: If you're going to make a movie that's well over two hours, you have to keep people interested right out of the gates. Otherwise, what's really the point? That's what I found myself asking every second of The Square. Not recommended in the least."
The Square,85,71,audience,"I watched this based on the reviews and liking the actors. I turned it off after 45 minutes because I thought it was weird, boring and too strange of a plot to hold my interest. Very puzzling to me as to why anyone would like this movie."
The Square,85,71,audience,"Christian (Claes Bang) is the respected curator of a contemporary art museum X-Royal in Stockholm, a divorced but devoted father of two who drives an electric car and supports good causes. His next show is ""The Square"", an installation which invites passersby to altruism, reminding them of their role as responsible fellow human beings. But sometimes, it is difficult to live up to your own ideals: Christian's foolish response to the theft of his phone drags him into shameful situations. Meanwhile, the museum's PR agency has created an unexpected campaign for ""The Square"". The response is overblown and sends Christian, as well as the museum, into an existential crisis...

At Cannes, critical reception was largely positive, though it was not expected to win the Palme d'Or. Variety's Owen Gleiberman called the film ""a suavely merciless take-down of the decadence of the contemporary art world,"" remarking the museum depicted is motivated by greed, and the film is ""more outrageous but less effective than Force Majeure."" Peter Bradshaw gave it four stars in The Guardian, judging it a ""sprawling and daringly surreal satire"". In The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy called it ""madly ambitious and frequently disquieting"", suggesting it might try to include too much, but had an impact. Robbie Collin gave it four stars in The Daily Telegraph, finding the first hour cleverly satirical, and a later scene horrific. Conversely, IndieWire critic Eric Kohn was disappointed by its over-indulgence and lack of structure, calling it ""a Pollock canvas of weird ideas tossed at the audience in search of a singular narrative, some of which stick better than others."" Writing for Sight & Sound, Giovanni Marchini Camia argued that the film was overlong but that the dinner scene was ""a veritable tour de force"", which he suggested could have made a great short film. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, ""The Square finds writer-director Ruben Östlund as ambitious as ever — and delivering an unforgettably unusual work whose challenging themes pay thought-provoking dividends.""

Ruben Östlund has a unique way of telling his stories. Often based with the foundation of a specific happening and the following consequences. And that goes for ""The Square"" as well. ""The Square"" is an intriguing satire with great acting and great cinematography. You are not really sure what´s going to happen and I do like that. Is it a Palme D´or winner in my eyes? No, and yet it did win. I don´t think that Östlund fully connect the dots in the end, but that´s my opinion. The film was entered into the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where it received positive reviews and won the Palme d'Or. It was subsequently selected for the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. It went on to win six European Film Awards, including Best Film; two Guldbagge Awards, including Best Director; and other honours. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards."

The Square,85,71,critic,"
None of the themes explored in this review required much close analysis. Unlike the knife's edge satire of Force Majeure, The Square is a blunt object. But maybe that's what it takes to point out our world's quotidian surrealism...

The Square has been called a satire, likely because we haven't developed a popular term for a film that, though drawn in exaggerated lines, at its foundation is hopeless and doesn't mean to teach us anything with its hopelessness.
 "
The Square,85,71,critic,"
As much as The Square enjoys poking fun at the buffoonery of the art world, it's more interested in what that world represents: a self-sustaining bubble where money, power, and posturing commingle.

The reason why The Square works so brilliantly with macabre and laughter is that it mirrors what we see and do everyday.

The Square is not really saying something new but it is making its points in a strikingly fresh, satiric way.

The Square is actually the sum of its parts, rather than a seamless whole. Viewers are probably going to pick differing scenes as their favourites.

Delightfully unhinged; a viewing experience that can't be conveniently collapsed into review-friendly phrases like ""precocious art world satire"" or ""modern morality play"". The Square is both of these things, and more.

The Beguiled,79,48,audience,"Colin Farell, Nicole Kidman, and Kirsten Dunst make a great cast as well as the other actresses who push this along. It really competes with the original one with Clint Eastwood. Nice dark film."
The Beguiled,79,48,audience,Well-acted and stylish
The Beguiled,79,48,audience,"We start out with a man about to die from his war wounds and end up with the man dead anyway, so really there shouldn't have been a movie about this, it's extremely slow and never picks up even in the climax. The cast is fantastic but that is seriously the only positive cause I feel like I wasted my time."
The Beguiled,79,48,audience,It's not often you can say that remake actually surpasses the original but that's exactly the case with Sofia Coppola's adaptation of The Beguiled (originally done by Don Siegel and Clint Eastwood in 1971). Coppola has a strong handling of the material and a masterful balance of tone and pace. Every scene is filled with such tension and intrigue that's it difficult to look away. Brilliantly structured and performed and one of Sofia's finest endeavours.
The Beguiled,79,48,audience,"This 19th century set civil war period film gives an interesting insight to various stranded wounded soliders who sought asylum and were taken in by private home owners, at times. A solid film with decent acting. Not much as far as plot other than a man heals in a home full of family of women and one by one start seeking him and his approval and affections until the seeds pf jealousy are planted and brought on by sexual tension. A horrible accident insues and causes extreme calapse and disarray within the family household."
The Beguiled,79,48,audience,"Il film non perde tempo in nessuna occasione e va dritto al sodo, sia nell'introduzione che nella parte conclusiva. La regia di classe della Coppola è senza dubbio l'aspetto che risalta di più; la ricercatezza dell'inquadratura perfetta, il particolare rapporto non convenzionale dell'immagine e i morbidi movimenti di camera rendono il film un piccolo capolavoro visivo. Il messaggio che traspare dalla narrazione è chiaro, semplice e molto diretto, una morale pragmatica presentata in modo impeccabile attraverso un tocco registico raffinato e aristocratico."
The Beguiled,79,48,audience,"There's something delicious about this semi-gothic tale of desire and vanity that draws you in. From the opening scenes, director Sophia Coppola sets things in motion, drawing much interest and expectations. She puts her attractive cast to good use through this delicately paced, intricate story. The film look is a bit dark which adds to the mood of the story, but sometimes fails to capture its most intimate moments. The plot doesn't leave much room for its rather vague characters, and that becomes a problem when the story gets turned on its head. From then on the story becomes ludicrous and opaque."

The Beguiled,79,48,audience,The movie has no purpose
The Beguiled,79,48,audience,"Between 2 and 2.5 stars. Insubstantial. There is no seduction, no tension. Colin is not Clint, and the actress, though their famous names, have no the strength and variety of characters of the original cast. I do not know why Coppola chose a dark photography, in contrast with the light that invaded the house in the original version. So, don't know why we wanted this remake for, apart for giving an opportuniyt to make a film to all the people involved."
The Beguiled,79,48,critic,"
An interesting and entertaining feminist take on a story that in the past was played as a sexualized fantasy.

War Machine,48,34,audience,"It's a kind of disturbing look at just how inept the military machine can be. It's made more troubling by the fact that it's mostly based on true events. The cast is solid all around, and there's a few good bits of dry humor, but the whole thing is far too uneven, and it's in no way the yuckfest they were trying to sell it as..."
War Machine,48,34,audience,"The first act is one hour long.

That's what it feels like to an amateur, at least."
War Machine,48,34,audience,A bunch of weak Hollywood clowns trying to poke fun at the military but just make themselves look like idiots like they usually do.
War Machine,48,34,audience,"Loosely based on Michael Hastings' nonfiction book The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America's War in Afghanistan recounting his experience shadowing General Stanley McChrystal in 2010 Afghanistan, David Michôd's reimagination is a choppy wartime satire about America's cult of war in Afghanistan and the Middle East."
War Machine,48,34,audience,"An anti-war movie that makes fun of the U.S military brass.  Raises excellent questions about the waste of U.S. people & resources in Afghanistan, still today with no end in sight.  Really reveals how stupid & foolish U.S. politicians are as they are the ones who keep the military there.  Too bad not more movies about that.  Brad Pitt is an a$$.  After watching this, I'm off his movies."
War Machine,48,34,audience,"Great critique of the 'war machine', surprisingly accurate to the Rolling Stone article, history, and...it is a very good look at how ridiculous it was to expect counter-insurgency to work in Afghanistan.  Very well done.  Brad Pitt is one clever fellow."
War Machine,48,34,audience,"Very interesting look at a different face of the military but, for the most part, the acting was not convincing.  There's also a lot of technical faux pas that make it all less convincing.  Then, after about 75 minutes in you realize why - it's a military slander piece meant to make them look like a joke... in a serious way.

War Machine,48,34,audience,I loved the subtle comedy and blatant plot-spoiling narration.  No sarcasm here.  I laughed a good amount. Its a good in between of a bruce willis war movie and a ben stiller war movie.
War Machine,48,34,audience,"Underrated. If you're a fan of military movies, you might be impressed by War Machine. Though, not as explosive as movies such as Hacksaw Ridge or Fury, it's softer approach to the explanation of the United States War Machine through film is quite engrossing in my opinion."
War Machine,48,34,audience,"this film is ridiculous but in its genial way because it tries to formulate a reflection while remaining always light and funny, and for the most part it succeeds"

The Sense of an Ending,75,51,audience,"Does the memory trick you? This idea is central to the theme of this movie as Jim Broadbent takes on the role of Tony Webster, a semi-retired camera dealer, who is reunited with his first lover when he receives a letter. As events unfold, Webster is forced to reevaluate his recollections of past events and come to terms with the dreadful consequences of his own actions. I really enjoyed this film and the tricks it plays with the viewer. Jim Broadbent is a wonderfully natural choice for the lead and is totally believable. Charlotte Rampling takes the role of his first love, Veronica and she does a sterling job in one of her characteristically complex parts. A very bittersweet drama, this film sparked an interesting conversation in my home about how recollections can become blurred over time. I'd recommend this movie as something a little out of the ordinary."
The Sense of an Ending,75,51,audience,"Well done melodrama that is carried by the excellent cast of British actors that can imbue this movie-of-the-week type material and a setting in posh England with a sense of class. Broadbent plays Tony Webster who's old college sweetheart's mother leaves him a letter, some money and a diary that never materializes. What unfolds is Tony's nostalgia and memories of his schools day versus what actually happened. Restrained, then goes for the OMG moment and then goes for the maudlin. ""The Sense of an Ending"" isn't exceptional yet an engaging film."
The Sense of an Ending,75,51,audience,"Despite being a film fan, I am a cinematic idiot. Many's the time when I'll work out some kind of clue or detail in a film, relay it with relish to my wife, only to have her look at me with an expression that one would make if someone told you conspiratorially that they'd worked out that albino people probably had a tough time in the sun. Obviously they do, sweetheart. Couple that with the fact that I'm a story man, and I like a thing to happen, which leads into another thing, to be rounded out by a third, logically reached thing that teaches everyone a valuable lesson, and you'll see that this film, full of musing and contemplation and thoughtful nuance, was largely wasted on me. Jim Broadbent receives word that someone left a diary to him in a will, and this leads him to reminisce and reevaluate his youth. It's a film about concepts more than action and agency. Things happen to support or set up an idea, and then the film ends and the clever people smile, nod, and say 'mmm, yeah. Very good', and I furrow my brow and say 'sure...'. The cast is good, and there's always a sense that something bigger is going on, but it's a book adaptation that I think remains more like a book than a film, and I'll be damned if you're expecting me to read a book."

The Sense of an Ending,75,51,audience,"'The Sense of an Ending' unexpectedly, and frustratingly, had NO sense of an ending. Hence the title? Ultimately, this style severely tainted the overall experience for me. Some of the film was quite intriguing - a bit humorous (dry), dramatic (Brit style), and even heart-tugging. However, the storyline depends on a ridiculous presumption that these intelligent young people, would initiate and hold such immature, angry grudges for the long-term hauls of life.

"I, Daniel Blake",92,85,audience,"reasonably acted, poorly scripted, vacuous poverty pornography for ideologues with socialist tendencies"
"I, Daniel Blake",92,85,audience,"I, Daniel Blake… a story about dehumanizing

This British film, which has been going on for more than four years since its release, is a good story about how bureaucracy is quite a drama for those people that capitalism doesn't take very much into account. Each stage and process that is seen in the film, gives truth to the burden that must live not only the old generations, but also the new ones.
The person who plays Blake is Dave Johns, who for his good performance helped win the Palme d'Or at Cannes for the film. A well-deserved award from my perspective, because this independent film shows a reality that a major film producer would not do, and that Sixteen Films and Why Not Productions did. Such a reality is the duality of the capitalist problem that represents on the one hand the skills or experience in young people and the knowledge of new technologies in older people.
In my opinion it is a good production, as it shows the reality of many people in the UK, people who don't drink tea with rolls, but yes with worries."
"I, Daniel Blake",92,85,audience,"A well-crafted, realistic and emotional commentary on technological change, economic crisis, and the struggles of working class people in England, with excellent performances from its relatively unknown cast and a poignant direction."
"I, Daniel Blake",92,85,audience,"It's really beautifully done, and I loved every second of the first three-quarters of the movie. It has a lot of heart and it all feels very real; these aren't fantastical stories about fictional people, they're things that happen to so many people every day, and the movie really brings out the drama in the normalcy of it all. Unfortunately I felt that the ending of the movie (starting around the spray-paint bit) was a little forced and cliche, although the emotional impact was still pretty effective. It was still a great movie and I'm glad I watched it."

I was there with them, living their lives and their pains. It calmly drags you down to their anxiety and despair hole. Without ever making the characters unfit of their human and social rights."
"I, Daniel Blake",92,85,audience,"BFI Southbank screened I, Daniel Blake before the release of Ken Loach's new film and I jumped at the opportunity to see it for the first time on the big screen. It's a hard watch, the consistently bleak circumstances surrounding the characters can be difficult to stomach but I've never seen a truer and more real portrayal of the gruelling, unrelenting benefits system in the UK. Ken Loach clearly massively cares about telling these people stories and the performances are astonishing from the less experienced cast. The one criticism I have with it is that Loach seems to really have to hammer home his point and it can get to the level which feels a little preachy but this is a minor concern about a brilliant, haunting and fantastically made film."

It's ok, but I feel mixed about this one 😉
I'd recommend it if you like this genre, but if not then probably give it a miss 👍🏼👎🏼

While the pace is very slow, I was somehow drawn to these unusual stories. The third one was particularly moving."
Certain Women,92,51,audience,loved it.  Would see it again.
Certain Women,92,51,audience,"Boring. The info said the 3 women's lives would intersect, but not really.  A lot of time was spent on the rancher woman but she was not identified as one of the 3 whose lives intersected - perhaps a bit of discrimination against the native american woman. Instead, the woman she interacted with was listed as one of the three, but not much time was spent on her. Way too much time on boring scenes."
Certain Women,92,51,audience,I watch movies for entertainment.  This movie went nowhere. Waiting for the characters to 'spit it out'. Everyone keeping each other hanging. What a waste of time.
Certain Women,92,51,audience,"It hits you over the head with its message, but not a lot is going on."
Certain Women,92,51,audience,worst movie ever put me to sleep
Certain Women,92,51,audience,"For foreign amateur reviewers on metacritic who complain that Hollywood never strays far from explosions and car chases, this is a reminder you can always find American art-school drama. It's a character study about women, obviously, three short stories that just barely and arbitrarily intersect. (Our favorite one about men is ""Saint Jack"" [1978] with Ben Gazzara in Singapore, which was shot in secret to avoid Singapore's nanny-state censors.) Some homegrown amateurs on metacritic complain that nothing ""happened."" Kids, write this down: there was a lot happening in emotional depth and light feminist themes in the backdrop of a vast, lonely, Montana vista that was a treat in itself. Not everything needs to follow a linear narrative with dramatic spikes or tropes. In any case, it's great to see Laura Dern in low gear after her manic performance in A-List TV (""Enlightened"") as well as Jared Harris from ""Mad Men."""
Certain Women,92,51,audience,"Certain Women is a quiet study of a film. A film about four strong women and how they navigate their way through the world. Kelly Reichardt makes slow, contemplative films and this one is no different. It does move at a slow pace but I think that actually deepens the impact rather than lessens it. It allows the viewer to take in all the subtleties and enjoy it even further. This film is based on short stories and it feels that way with separate stories about women in small town Montana. There is a lawyer battling to help her client, which ultimately ends in a hostage situation. A wife and mother trying to build her dreamhouse and lastly a young lawyer teaching a night class. In the night class stumbles a young farm hand who develops an ambiguous crush. We quietly see how they view the world and more importantly how the world views them. It's a very quiet film with only one scene having a music score. It is superbly acted with Laura Dern, Michelle Williams, Kristen Stewart and newcomer Lily Gladstone showing off their acting skills. Reichardt is superb at making naturalistic and realistic films that glow in their quiet humanity. This film is no different."
Certain Women,92,51,audience,Watching grass grow may be more interesting. A movie only critics could love. There is not a plot.

The resulting quietude and honesty doesn't detract from the emotionality of the film; on the contrary, it lends a realism that hits home all the harder.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
[Reichardt's] dedicated naturalism allows her audience the freedom to feel as freely and deeply as she does about her characters and their lives.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
Perfectly tuned for its quietude imbued in loneliness and longing, Certain Women is certainly one of her finest films to date...
 "

Certain Women never detaches from Reichardt's personal aesthetic to work as good drama. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
Reichardt uses the expansive, empty Northwestern landscape to powerful effect in Certain Women, and by the time all is said and done, you can't help but feel both a little more lonely and a little more of a kindred spirit with these characters.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
Observant, heartfelt, and incredibly eloquent, Reichardt's latest unfolds with poetic finesse, building to a powerful crescendo of sublimated emotion.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
What's particularly great, besides the film's uncanny ability to replicate the sensation of reading a heady, well-collected, complementary collection of short stories, is the tactful feminism deployed in casual asides and male absence.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
Earthy, real, and rich despite its understated narratives, Certain Women will reward patient cinemagoers with its delicate detail.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
There's no arguing that Certain Women has moments of incredible power. But the film itself can be greatly uneven.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
Reichardt, in addition to the slow and methodical storytelling, continues to use the landscape to tremendous effect, the cinematography is gorgeous and the location plays a great role in underscoring every scene.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
A quiet, female-focused triptych of tales that keeps its scope quite modest.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
Reichardt doesn't have the same narrative conventions to fall back on, but like the women she follows with her camera, she forges her own path and in doing so, comes up with something bewitching.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
What's really important in the film is all internal and Reichardt's direction and the excellent performances of all four women give us the time to see below the surface and start to feel how these women themselves experience their lives.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
Reichardt paints life's small contours with the brush of a majestic poetess, giving voice to the seemingly unremarkable -- even mundane -- aspects of living and imbuing them with secrets and mysteries that have the power to enchant us, even make us cry.
 "
Certain Women,92,51,critic,"
To write this film off as a simple story about 3 women in Montana would be doing it a huge disservice. It might be quiet, but its ideas are not.

Certain Women belongs to the four women at its core.

Genius,53,46,audience,"Great insight into the creative process and the anguish that is involved.  I also appreciate the depictions of the sacrifices that the spouses have to endure for the greater good of the ""genius""."
Genius,53,46,audience,"Debo haber visto esta película tres veces en el último año, y todas las veces me sorprendió de la misma forma. Comprendo que no todo el mundo la entienda (aunque a la vez... no) porque está muy encarnada en el mundo editorial y en los escritores del momento. Capaz en eso sea algo cerrada? A lo mejor hay que conocerlos a todos para que los personajes te generen un impacto real. Pero la verdad que es una masterpiece, 10000/10."
Genius,53,46,audience,"Muddled attempt of recreating a historical literary episode has some good period detail, but most figures are portrayed unsympathetically (especially Jude Law's Thomas Wolfe) and hardly manages to give an impression what the fuss is all about."
Genius,53,46,audience,"Not as good as I wanted it to be when it came out, but not as bad as many of the reviews. A solid 'fair'..."
Genius,53,46,audience,"A very fine period piece about Thomas Wolfe, his mistress, and his literary editor at Scribner's."
Genius,53,46,audience,"Admirable, yet unable to achieve the heights of its namesake."
Genius,53,46,audience,thoroughly enjoyed this movie as I knew nothing about Tom Wolfe
Genius,53,46,audience,This was a beautifully acted movie which I found very moving.  Anyone who loves literature and loves to  learn about the 20th century writers' struggles to make sense of modern life and to care for one another should appreciate this movie.    I think the movie requires a literary and educated audience and perhaps that is why the ratings are unfortunately low.  I almost gave stars.   I'm so glad I watched it!
Genius,53,46,audience,I found this film beautiful
Genius,53,46,audience,"While I found Jude Law mesmerizing in ""The Young Pope"", I think he destroyed this movie.  So none of us actually knows what Thomas Wolfe was really like, but Jude Law's portrayal of him was all over the place. I guess we're lacking serious character actors these days, but I think the role called for a more dignified portrayal.  And Jude Law could have pulled off a more dignified portrayal, but he missed it and failed to create a believable character that any normal person would be able to identify with.  

While I like Nicole Kidman and she did an excellent job, I couldn't buy the scene where she pulled the gun on Colin Firth.  Who does that? really?  

Colin Firth saved the movie!  He is extraordinary in everything he does and I watch every movie he does!  Love, love, love him.

Why does anyone cast Laura Linny in anything?  She's annoying and her scenes and interactions with the rest of the cast made me uncomfortable."
Genius,53,46,critic,"
A great wall separates the producers, writers and directors at present from the kind of mental effort it takes to represent the world in a serious artistic manner. For the most part, unhappily, they have only clichés and guesswork at their disposal.

Genius remains tightly focused on the relationship between Wolfe and Perkins. When their bromance begins to unravel, it feels like a love affair drawing to a close (though the story never makes that suggestion).
 "
Love & Friendship,96,60,audience,"A stunning achievement for any fan of costume drama. It took me two fascinated viewings to understand the plot properly. The dialog is very fast, and you have to pay close attention. I have now seen the movie three times. And I have read the script, which is also helpful, particularly in understanding the characters' names and relationships. The printed labels in the movie that spell out some of this information about the characters are fine, but they fly by very quickly. The story is based on a Jane Austen work that is less well known than some of her others. But a note at the end of the movie credits suggests that the plot of the original novel is somewhat different from that of the movie in at least one key way. I'm looking forward to reading the original Jane Austen novella."
Love & Friendship,96,60,audience,"Witty, fun and delightful. Spot on performances by accomplished actors, beautiful settings, gorgeous period dress. If you want a fun escape from the current dreary state of world affairs, you'll enjoy this one. Improves after each viewing."
Love & Friendship,96,60,audience,Disappointing as it was a dull and dreary old English story-line that didn't amount to much plus it wasn't the least bit funny for a comedy. Kate Beckinsdale is the only character that made it somewhat bearable.
Love & Friendship,96,60,audience,"While the fast-paced dialogue presents a challenge to follow and comprehend without missing a beat, Love & Friendship is well-acted and at times, hilarious. Kate Beckinsale and Tom Bennett are fantastic. I will say its smartly (and perhaps mercifully) quick, as a longer film with more drawn out plot elements would surely cause some to lose interest."
Love & Friendship,96,60,audience,"Un fiume di delicate buone maniere che sfocia sul nulla. Tutto è confezionato con cura, dai dialoghi troppo ricchi alle scenografie dettagliate fino al minimo particolare, ma in fin dei conti il film lascia praticamente niente, coinvolgendo in poche occasioni. Si tratta di un'esperienza piuttosto vuota che offre dell'intrattenimento moderato e temporaneo, niente di più, niente di meno."
Love & Friendship,96,60,audience,"The endless Jane Austen-trademark gossip-dialogue, and an accurately unfinished ending (probably as an intentional, yet ill-advised homage to the novella) leaves a lot to be desired, even with the beautiful production design and some distinctive moments of hilarious directing style."
Love & Friendship,96,60,audience,Beckinsale is fantastic and the gleefully amoral story is so much fun.

The fact that the writer-director can come up with a number of pointed, scathing lines makes it all the more unfortunate that he pulls his social punches.

Instead of relishing Lady Susan's tricky schemes to ensnare eligible bachelors, we are left admiring the proceedings as a bit of creative anachronism rather than, say, an Oscar Wilde-worthy exercise in savage social satire.

Writer Whit Stillman's staccato dialogue (from his adapted screenplay), performed by what only could be described as a cast of character actors who used their brilliant instruments to elicit laughter and surprise from the viewer, is music to the ears.

Love & Friendship immediately stands out as [Whit Stillman's] most purely confectionery film to date.

It's a novel transformed into cinema, but it's also a film that has allowed itself to be contaminated by literature. And that is the rarer, and greater, achievement.
 "

Stillman's film is a delightful, affectionate Regency parody for audiences that appreciate language and style, with the added bonus of a twist in its tail.
 "
Love & Friendship,96,60,critic,"
Whit Stillman was meant to make a Jane Austen adaptation.
 "
Love & Friendship,96,60,critic,"
Together, Kate Beckinsale and writer/director Whit Stillman ensure that ""Love And Friendship"" charges along at a cracking pace as Lady Susan drives a coach and horses through polite society.
 "
Love & Friendship,96,60,critic,"
Whit Stillman's Love and Friendship can be best read as a largely satirical nod to the now hugely over-familiar Austen mini-genre of films prevalent since the mid '90s.

A Bigger Splash,89,58,audience,"magnificently executed, poetic film for anyone who appreciates an aesthetic film where the plot of the film does not necessarily bring an action-filled highlight, but rather an experience where one is left with a deeper mindset and an aesthetic experience based on the underlying message of the film."
A Bigger Splash,89,58,audience,"A bit obvious and not psychologically complex as some have suggested.  Four people come together in a luxury Mediterranean villa, a man and a woman who are partners and a man (ex-lover) and his pretty daughter.  Guess what happens?  Slow-paced but not in a good way, some have praised Ralph Fiennes extrovert performance.  Agreed but if the plot is superficial the acting is irrelevant."
A Bigger Splash,89,58,audience,"loved it! fantastic cast, I can't complain!"
A Bigger Splash,89,58,audience,"Way funnier than I heard going in, so right off the bat the movie showed it's subversive side. Ralph Fiennes is utterly delightfully and I got swept up in the first half with a constant smile on my face, it was so feel-good, that I KNEW something was wrong but couldn't quite put my finger on it. The psychosexual crime thriller elements, however, are sure to kick into gear and suddenly everything gets WAY more shocking. I'm really bummed about where the plot went in terms of ""Oh, but I wanted to see more of that character!"" But the subversive jarring shift in tone makes the disappointment more than forgivable as the film becomes unbearably tense for it's last third as you feel like each character's subtle realization of each other's sins is gonna come bite each other in the ass as one (or all, at this point) of them tries to kill someone else. I would put my incorrect predictions here, but they're laced with spoilers, so go watch the movie and find out!"
A Bigger Splash,89,58,audience,Pretty dark drama that was well played by Swinton and Fiennes...she's a mute rock star and he's mostly skinny dipping in the pool....

- Harry Hawkes: Yeah, well, Europe is a grave."" "

A Bigger Splash,89,58,audience,"One of the most beautifully filmed movies I've seen this year from a cinematography point of view.  Also one of the dullest films I've seen in years, when you're checking before you've even got to half way how long is left to go you know this isn't going to win you over.  I found it staggeringly boring."
A Bigger Splash,89,58,audience,"Even with some forgettable performances, the film excels in its overall cinematography and for the most part, Guadagnino has utilised some excellent skills behind the camera. Although the film looks amazing, that was also my biggest problem. With such amazing skill and vibrant use of lighting and unique, independent direction, it becomes atypical of the genre, more an ode to the twilight years of independent filmmaking, taking tropes from films such as Submarine (2010) and Lost in Translation (2003). 

Although the film may look beautiful, it's merely a masquerade for a plot filled to the brim with political messages that don't always add up with the characters motifs and some pretty inconsistent dialogue. Other than Fiennes and Swinton, there's really nothing here that would be worth seeing. A Bigger Splash is rather full of itself, being a satire of the independent movie movement, but one with a large budget, and an even larger ego. If you're going to watch this film, then watch it for an impeccable Fiennes performance, and nothing more."
A Bigger Splash,89,58,audience,"In an isolated villa on the small Italian island of Pantelleria, world-famous rock singer Marianne Lane (Tilda Swinton) is on holiday with her filmmaker lover Paul (Matthias Schoenaerts). She is recovering from surgery and has lost her voice, communicating only by signs and occasional whispers. He is in recovery from alcohol addiction and a failed suicide attempt. Neither speaks Italian but solitude is what both need, until an aeroplane from Rome brings a man neither wants to see. This is Harry (Ralph Fiennes), an extroverted music promoter who was Marianne's lover until he passed her on to his protegé, Paul. With him is Penelope (Dakota Johnson), a previously unknown daughter of his who says she is 22. Moving into the villa, Harry starts inviting friends around as if it were his home and taking everybody out to various sights and festivities. His arrogant manner bores Pen and annoys Paul, but Marianne starts falling under his spell again; however, when Harry and Marianne begin to become intimate while alone, Marianne stops Harry. She tells him that she does love him, but that she cannot be with him and that she is with Paul. The sultry Pen then makes a play for the unhappy Paul. A move that creates a whirlwind of jealousy, passion and, ultimately, danger for everyone involved... 

""A Bigger Splash"" received generally positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes consensus states: ""Absorbing, visually arresting, and powerfully acted by an immensely talented cast, A Bigger Splash offers sumptuously soapy delights for fans of psychological adult drama.""

""A Bigger Splash"" is a pretentious tale with a strange moral consensus, strange editing, wobbly acting, wobbly chemistry between the leads and Fiennes totally over the top. I don´t really like Swinton, Johnson seems lost, while Schoenarts is the one who delivers. However, the problem is that all the characters are unlikable and annoying. Meaning there´s nothing that keeps you hanging on to the story and its characters. I reckon this tale is supposed to be erotic and sexy, but doesn´t really hit the target in my book at all since there´s no proper tension and no real substance that creates that erotic feeling. I truly disliked ""A Bigger Splash""."

Despite its many fun moments and good direction from Guadagnino, A Bigger Splash is too uneven and lightweight to truly impress.
 "

[Luca Guadagnino's] cathartic visual style seems to fluctuate too loosely between complimenting his script's character nuances and shameless superficiality.

It slowly builds from a languid romance into a psychological thriller that is both compelling and unnerving.

My Golden Days,90,50,audience,An excellent work of film-making with extraordinary performances by  Quentin Dolmaire and Lou Roy-Lecollinet. I love the elusiveness of her character and the so obvious and intense adoration between them. Such torrid love amid the early section where he shows such fearlessness when helping his 'twin' escape the USSR and giving Kovalki hell early and the end of the film. The last scene is utter perfection.
My Golden Days,90,50,audience,"Harking back to the glory days of French cinema, when Francois Truffaut introduced super cool Parisian chic to the world, ""My Golden Days"" (a terrible translation of ""Trois Souvenirs de ma Jeunesse"") colourfully captures the carefree escapades of wild, romantic youth.

Everyone is cool. Everyone smokes. Everyone is busy living the life they will soon relish only in glazed-eyed memories. This a well acted, lovely tale of a couple of kids, stumbling through adult weight emotions, baggage and heartbreak. ""My Golden Days"" isn't so much a fond ode to lost youth, as it is a reminder that the crux of life may come at any time, and can be cruelly short.

The French love it, bestowing a slew of film awards as proof, and you may too.

My Golden Days,90,50,audience,"Being young, having a beautiful girlfriend and other things that had done!

They say its a prequel to the 1996 film 'My Sex Life' that I haven't seen, but this looked good and its not. I'm not sure how much one has to be familiar with the original film, though it does not matter much I think since it is a prequel. Because everything starts here and follows there. So I saw it, and I wanted to like it, but not fully impressed. The story was told in chapters. The opening was like some kind of a spy thriller, but soon when the episode 'Esther' begins, it turned into a romance drama.

A man who has been investigated when another person with the same identity was found. So he reveals his school day's events, followed by his first girlfriend and complication surrounding it he had faced. That, how he had won her over the older boys and about his close friend, till leaving them behind to work in the central Asia. Mostly it is a love story with some twists in the affair, but how it all ends still remains mystery even after the narration ended.

The issue is it is not detailing anything, just reveals events of a youngster's romance life. Particularly the end was not good. So I think that's why I need to see the first film, resuming the narration could continue from where this one concluded. I leave (_b_l_a_n_k__s_p_a_c_e_) till I saw that and update this review, if I change my stance over this one. Even if I didn't like, still I would update it.

Meanwhile back to the review; it is like a French version of 'Flashbacks of a Fool'. Technically, there's no fault in this, only the screenplay did not convince me. The actors were so good, no doubt its a well made film that some people would enjoy it and I hope you are one of those.

6/10"
My Golden Days,90,50,audience,"Love this film. It's so hard see good movie about teenage-Young adult time of life and this film nailed, performances were great. I did care of the relationship of the two and felt it was real. The only thing i did not enjoy was his child but I understand why is there to show how the relation with his mother and his unt afect his life later maybe if I rewatch I appreciate more ."
My Golden Days,90,50,audience,"Apparently written by a guy who never got over and subsequently mythologized his high school girlfriend. The result is a depiction of a woman who no one has ever encountered in real life, and who is: dismally hopeless without her man, irresistibly sexual and heinously rude to everyone. 

In addition to a disjointed opening that barely hinges to the rest of the movie are more-than-pretentious discussions further marred by some poor translations of the French. 

Truly dismal."
My Golden Days,90,50,audience,"I can't say it was horrible but I will say, there were so many hanging story threads and disjointed scenes and sentences that I can NOT say it was a good film. 3 out of 10 stars"
My Golden Days,90,50,audience,This film starts out with some interesting scenes. The last hour of this two hour and 15 minute movie should have been 15 minutes. It was like a tortured junior high school romance.
My Golden Days,90,50,audience,"Really a big disappointment. I had no idea why the New Yorker, the Wall Street Journal and LA Times loved it. Self indulgent and pretentious are over used words but apply to this movie. The director never managed to gain a perspective on his central character who was in love with a very attractive but nebulous woman who could never find her way in life but seemed as though she knew the answers. The character then gets angry with his friend for sleeping with her and remains bitter into middle age about his friends' betrayal but he left her many times and had other girlfriends. At the end though he seemed to  treat her as his property that the friend had stolen. The more interesting idea that he gave away his identity to a Soviet Jew refusnik in the form of giving his own passport to another person in Russia was not followed up on and many other story threads were either forgotten or abandoned. The central characters' supposed interest in anthropology and his travels to Turkministan seemed random and were not tied into the story. There is some good acting along the way but please do not waste your time on this movie."

My Golden Days,90,50,audience,"A very ""french"" film about two lovers.  A love that is all consuming and lasts pretty much a lifetime.  This love is one that the characters pretty much never forget about it.  There's just certain people in your life that you have a special all encompassing infatuation with.  The ending was a bit abrupt but the passion/love was done fairly well, although over handed."
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
Utterly believable and charming in its sincerity, Trois Souvenirs puts any bombastic films looking back at one's life to shame.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
Glossy, and distractingly nostalgic, My Golden Days is Desplechin at his most pleasant and potentially least ambitious, but enjoyable nonetheless.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
Though consistently amusing, the narrative direction and central themes of My Golden Days are too confused for it to serve as anything more than light entertainment.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
The highs of infatuation and lows of betrayal are genuine and acutely felt by characters who are striving to discover themselves while being both profound and shallow simultaneously.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
The details of the story aren't particularly compelling, but Desplechin's telling casts a spell that's curiously thrilling, as the film seems to be constantly reinventing itself as it goes.

A charming French film about young love, about the beauty of youth, about the best years of life...

Using offbeat humor and emotional sensitivity, My Golden Days is an ode to youth culture and its enchanting unknowns.
 "

Although it has the offkilter rhythm of actual memories and employs stylistic flourishes like 80s-era split-screens, My Golden Day"" is never hard to follow.

Packed with lovely moments and vivid nostalgia for youthful passion.
 "

[PODCAST]Here's a film with a young, powerful, and complicated female lead (played by Lou Roy-Lecollinet). Arnaud Desplechin should be a household name.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
There's no lack of youthful energy and spontaneity, but nothing makes a lasting impression.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
Two beautifully modulated central performances and an accomplished sense of pacing are undone by the weary drone of familiarity in this lovelorn French melodrama from the writer-director Arnaud Desplechin.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
The film is an undeniable pleasure, with a wicked sense of humour and real heart.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
Don't be put off by the subtitles - this is one of the great modern teen movies.
 "

Desplechin's film-making language is always fluent and rich.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
This quasi-autobiographical trilogy is further proof that AD is the Proust of modern French cinema.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
Impeccably staged and played, this scattershot reflection on the follies, glories and regrets of youth pays affectionate tribute to a world of handwritten letters and payphones that has all but disappeared.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
Desplechin allows the search for lost times to unfold with a light touch, a vivid sense of Paris in the 1980s and 1990s, and a cast who bring freshness and vitality to the most familiar ingredients of a first great love. It has been well worth the wait.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
Desplechin's haunting and heartbreaking rumination on the growing pains of growing up adds up to a story with strong connective tissue that's well worth seeing.
 "
My Golden Days,90,50,critic,"
A sensitive film of surprising changes of rhythm and tone that become constant, enriching in an arborescent way its sense but never modifying it. [Full review in Spanish]

45 Years,97,67,audience,Touching and sophisticated portrait of a relationship
45 Years,97,67,audience,"L'estrema semplicità del film non può essere considerata il suo unico difetto perché è esattamente il suo più grande pregio. Forse non sarò esattamente il target di pubblico ideale per questa pellicola chiaramente improntata per spettatori più ""anziani"", ma percepisco con chiarezza un messaggio morale davvero esemplare. Tutto viene trasmesso con intelligenza e sensibilità, con una regia ponderata ed una narrazione essenziale e dritta al punto. Il talento dei due attori protagonisti conferisce autenticità ad un film che mi ha sinceramente stupito."
45 Years,97,67,audience,"This is adult filmmaking at it's best. Acting, scripts, sets and costume are all spot on. The subtle performances are a delight as actors delve into an intelligent script that speaks to a long, traditional marriage. Outstanding performances!"
45 Years,97,67,audience,"The movie is so touching, and emotional. The ending completes the movie when she realises that she has been living another life like his husband's love of life for him and he realises that his wife is his grand love who has been married to him for 45 years."
45 Years,97,67,audience,"Unlike most slow movies, I never wanted to turn it off.  It built like waves crashing against the shore as the tide inexorably came in.  A very quiet movie and it leaves you with a sense of melancholy and loss.  A beautiful movie, but one that makes you want something more in your life than they achieved."
45 Years,97,67,audience,"Personally, I do not hate this film but wouldn't watch it for a second time since it gave a more boring plot of tough love. Charlotte Rampling is undoubtedly a great actress, but she provided more subtle acting in her guest role in Dexter. In this film, I can understand the clear message and story, but can be better elevated. The other characters in the film seem to not have improved that elevation."
45 Years,97,67,audience,"Forgettable melodrama whose story has been done better, over and over again. The acting is its only memorable aspect."
45 Years,97,67,audience,"Slow burn type of film which shows how a relationship falls apart. The acting in this movie is phenomenal and the cinematography is outstanding. Especially the photo-slide scene and the heartbreaking final scene. Wow! My only issues with this one is that the story is too simple (I felt that some twist or something could have been added) and that some scenes drag way too much, making some parts feel slow and boring. Overall, I recommend this one!"
45 Years,97,67,audience,A masterpiece in subtlety.
45 Years,97,67,audience,"If you want to watch a long, boring movie that basically has no point, have at it.  "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
45 Years is intelligently done, but the filmmakers' reduction of the drama to the fate of a couple of dissatisfied souls takes its toll.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
It's a mature story brought to life by two remarkable actors who aren't afraid to trust the story's emotional core and take the time to allow it to burrow deep into the viewer's intellect and more importantly, heart.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
Without feeling overly decorative, Haigh routinely finds exquisite ways to frame the gulf growing between them.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
Keenly observed... A career-best performance by Charlotte Rampling culminates in a final moment that is powerfully stunning.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
Playing like the chilly counter to romantic melodrama Brief Encounter, Haigh's 45 Years is a sharply observed portrait of how time is mistakenly honored or acknowledged as proof of the foundation between two people.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
One of the most shining examples of depth and power in independent filmmaking.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
This film is slow, intense, sometimes painful, but also very beautiful.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
Rampling in her prime and so deserving...watching her unravel almost imperceptibly, elegantly, heartbreakingly, is a masterclass.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
What we are really watching is not just the love and joy of a 45-year commitment, but the toll as well.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
'45 Years' captures a lifetime of drama in one particular week.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
45 Years is exquisitely acted with Rampling giving a tour-de-force performance of such subtle power it is breathtaking.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
Haigh incorporates wry observations about relationships, both humorous and tragic, while intelligently reflecting on aging. Sadly though, 45 Years never quite reaches the promise of its premise.

Props to director Andrew Haigh for his tremendous achievement.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
45 Years is arguably the most heartbreaking drama of the year, but it is worth every moment of sadness.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
[Andrew Haigh] treats the older, straight, married couple who are the film's focus with the complexity that other filmmakers reserve for characters under 50.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
... the beautiful thing about 45 Years is its unique ability to keep you guessing about, well, everything, without ever revealing the whole truth.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
Visually stunning and exquisitely acted, 45 Years transcends its own occasional sleepiness to become one of the more poignant British dramas in some years.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
A bravura exemplar of mature storytelling where the temptation to wrap things up in an epiphanic, cathartic ending is waived for a more truthful view of life's tainted flux.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
Can be described as a slow-motion psychological horror film that doesn't shed a drop of blood.
 "
45 Years,97,67,critic,"
Tom Courtenay's modulated and fine-line balance of regression and fear is brilliant. Charlotte Rampling is quietly devastating.
 "
Youth,71,69,audience,"Beautiful! Visual poetry and beautiful symbolism of living a human life: the lightness the dark, the beauty and the and ugly, most of all avoid the mediocre (?)."
Youth,71,69,audience,"Not as beautiful as La Grande Bellezza, but still very good."
Youth,71,69,audience,"The Greatest Beauty
Paolo Sorrentino's latest movie, the director's return to Cannes after the worldwide success gained with the Best Foreign Movie Oscar (yet the Croisette didn't particularly liked the film which later on won at the Academy Award), could and should be appreciated by the Neapolitan director-screenwriter's admirers, for his usual subtlety of camera work and the and memorable lines, as well as by his detractors, for the unexpectedly solid and consistent story development, something that in the past The Great Beauty's director has seldom achieved.
And indeed there is much more beauty in Youth than in Sorrentino's former hit, exactly for the savvy mix of images and narration, for the excellent compactness of the cinematic language and writing, regrettably missing in the calligraphic series of beautiful images that made up The Great Beauty.
In an exclusive and secluded thermal hotel on the Swiss Alps gather, like elephants at a savanna watering hole at dusk, guests of every age and origin, each looking for something different but all joined by the lack of this ""something"". With the calm and lightness of a glider, the movie flies over Fred, a retired great musician and conductor searching his human dimension in addition to his musical one, and Mick, a famous director searching a last movie which could amazingly seal a career that, however glittering, started to show the unmistakable signs of a slow decline. The movie takes the viewer, with crafty and touching empathy, to the final results of these searches, harmonic for Fred, dystonic for Mick.
Captivating in the title choice, identifying youth with the inner search and growth rather than the body biological age, Youth is structured in dwindling layers, strongly integrated and unified: a protagonist (a self-controlled and convincing Michael Caine as Fred), a co-protagonist (the dependable Hervey Keitel as Mick), two secondary characters (an emotionally involved Rachel Wiesz as Fred's daughter and a cautious and endearing Paul Dano as the Californian star), circled by a chorus of characters painted with few yet definite strokes, reminding of the Commedia dell'Arte: the football legend beyond Sunset Boulevard, the masseuse of few words, the Alpine guide, Miss Universe, the Queen representative, the 100% made in Hollywood movie star (an ironic and charismatic yet ineffective Jane Fonda), the mixed group of your screenwriters, the silent couple…..
The risky strategy of mixing faked reality (the Queen, the real pop start, the football star) to real narration proved to pay off: most probably Youth shall not gather the prizes and success of The Great Beauty but surely represents a clear leap forward towards Paolo Sorrentino's full maturity as a director and a screenwriter."
Youth,71,69,audience,i saw many movies like this one and sorry still didn't get it at all.too may symbolic scene and the story itself is...whatever
Youth,71,69,audience,"Paolo Sorrentino orchestrates an eloquent ensemble performance, David Lang's evocative music, Luca Bigazzi's gorgeous cinematography and into an operatic and sagacious testament to evanescence of beauty, memories, celebrity and florescence."
Youth,71,69,audience,"At one point during ""Youth"", directed by Paolo Sorrentino, a character says, ""focus on some insignificant detail."" And that's sort of sums up what's wrong with this film. Beautifully shot and well acted, you can't quit watching, but the simple-minded dialogue keeps interrupting. For example, Harvey keitel's character seems to exist for no other reason but to annoy, with his disagreements and dogmatic utterances. I like watching Michael Caine, who plays an accomplished but retired composer, talk about the past, his regrets,  which is interesting, but not as inspired as it thinks it is. I was really looking forward to a short scene with Jane Fonda as an aging Diva telling off a long time director friend. But even though she's good in it, it's not very good. The dialogue is cliched and shallow. There's a great scene near the end where Harvey Keitel imagines all of his leading ladies throughout the years speaking lines of dialogue . It's interesting and cool and meaningful. But not quite enough of those. You'll probably reach the end of this movie feeling like you didn't get it. But maybe there wasn't really that much to get."
Youth,71,69,audience,Mas que filme maravilhoso. NÃ£o dÃ¡ nada de mÃ£o beijada. Fiquei querendo re-ver na mesma hora que acabou. Lindo demais.
Youth,71,69,audience,"Must see! 
(see it alone, quiet, preferably a little high)"
Youth,71,69,audience,"terrible. I'm sad I can't get the time back I spent watching. great actors, clearly they just needed a project to keep the machine running."
Youth,71,69,audience,"Potentially one of Mr Caine's best movies of recent years. beautifully acted by all, always interesting and in no way obvious."
Youth,71,69,critic,"
Italian filmmaker Paolo Sorrentino's Youth is a visual and verbal dribble about aging.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
It's almost impossible to feel sympathy for normally great actors Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel as they are given characters who seem to mourn the loss of their patriarchal identity.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
Appreciating the project as a whole will be entirely dependent on viewers' admiration of abstract ideas over standard storytelling.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
Overwrought nine-tenth-life crisis drama in which even a great cast... cannot create a lick of sympathy for the artistic and existential turning points on arty display.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
Full of confidence, Sorrentino's direction never wavers and he sees the film through to the end.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
Beside the ace cinematography, Caine and Keitel's buddy routine is the best thing about Youth.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
A unique examination and contemplation of life and age, which is uniquely told with some random abandon but filled with a delicious dark, yet at times, quirky humor.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
The editing, work of Cristiano Travaglioli, deserves our full attention. We are probably talking about his most refined work, which together with the director's work, results the most perfect film of his filmography. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
Immersive, lush and tender, yet oddly lacking in emotional power despite the affecting performances, Youth is a frustrating and joyous film in equal measure.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
As a writer-director, Sorrentino is an unquestionable talent; it would just be nice if he didn't rely on such pretentious contrivances to tell us what we already know.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
Like The Great Beauty, Youth has great cinematography but when the results are this loathsome, I'm reminded of how much I would rather see a dimly lit, poorly shot film with a great script than another monstrosity with great stills.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
Sorrentino's floating gaze transcends mere petty politics for much deeper, almost epiphanic readings of his characters' respective journeys.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
Fred, Lena, and Mick are not interesting characters; nothing about their appearance stands out, and their problems (infidelity, betrayal, alienation) are all very bland.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
It is the sort of the film where you must allow the musical score to wash over you like waves lapping on the beach whilst your eyes bathe in the colours on screen.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
While the dreamlike imagery is lovely and attempting to solve Sorrentino's ambiguous themes will probably help you develop a strong mental stamina, it's not an experience many would consider unpretentious.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
There are several major problems with Youth. What it has to say about youth, maturity and old age remains unclear.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
his can be seen as a companion piece to Sorrentino's The Great Beauty, exploring as it does the process of growing older... Sorrentino's triumph is that he does this in a way that's both beautiful and life-affirming, yet also heart-breaking.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
It's a film that engages you in many small ways even if the plot thread tying everything together is never quite satisfying.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
Youth, with an innocent and wandering eye, minimizes the glamor and privilege, spotlighting a common humanity that tends to succumb to invisibility.
 "
Youth,71,69,critic,"
The offbeat teaming of Caine and Keitel anchors this wryly humorous Alpine-set fantasia, rich in beguiling images and suffused with a quiet, sensual melancholy.

Brooklyn,97,87,audience,"2021-2-13 So the girl left her homeland for a better life, got a job, had the best two elders taking care of her living and sending her to classes, and married to a decent Italian guy. Then she went back to Ireland for a month because her sister died. In this month she caught up with old friends, and met a charming guy from childhood. Got threatened(?) by the old lady from the grocery  store when she was about to cheat on her newly married husband, and then she went back to Brooklyn. Well, sorry, I'm not so into this kind of stories even though they made it looks beautiful :) The Italian guy's 8-year-old brother is the cutest."
Brooklyn,97,87,audience,"Glorious and sentimental, in a very good way"
Brooklyn,97,87,audience,"The costumes and the depiction of the time placed in the film are extremely well done, the only problem is that ""Brooklyn"" could have been counted in less time"
Brooklyn,97,87,audience,Nothing really happens to this dull characters.
Brooklyn,97,87,audience,I really do think this is one of the best romances of the 21st century. 
Brooklyn,97,87,audience,"Many would probably be sceptical about this 2015 book adaptation by director John Crowley after reading the premise for the first time. A young, inexperienced woman from a small town in Ireland travels to the big and scary America where, after an initial rough road, she later meets the love of her life. Sounds like a classic tearjerker, but is much more than that due to its enormous depth and an outstanding leading actress.

Saoirse Ronan almost single-handedly manages to put the cliché of the gushy romance to rest early on in the film. She starts off as an enormously shy newcomer who doesn't really know where she stands in life and in the social hierarchy. As she progresses, as she is able to confide in more and more people, she becomes more confident and also more extroverted in a very discreet way. This makes her performance very versatile and prompts one to follow her development closely throughout the film. Emory Cohen delivers a very emotional performance as the man by her side, but sometimes he falls into that very cliché of exuberance. Often his presence next to Ronan also seems rather indifferent, which is of course also due to her strong performance. Their chemistry is very natural in many moments and seems very real to you, but also somewhat unbalanced at times.

Brooklyn starts off enormously well and is never really boring despite its simple plot. Yes, the film takes a lot of time in some scenes, but that is exactly what is needed to understand the romance and above all the protagonists tug-of-war. It is not only a coming of age and love story, but also reveals the contrast between two completely different cultures, namely life in the big New York and in the small Irish town where everybody knows and talks about everybody. For this, the film could well have been longer than 107 minutes. Towards the end, a lot of action is packed into a relatively short period of time, which makes the ending rather rushed. If this had been handled a little better, Brooklyn would have been a romantic masterpiece. As it is, however, it is a very beautiful film that is much more than a simple romance."
Brooklyn,97,87,audience,Well worth the effort -- a classically great movie!
Brooklyn,97,87,audience,"It's a perfect film. It's not the best film of all time, but it's one of the 20 or so ""perfect"" films since 1900. So real, and so heartfelt. It's light though; not so emotional and deep that you fall asleep or become depressed. It portrays humanity so well, and makes you feel a sense of upbeat buoyancy."
Brooklyn,97,87,audience,"Saoirse Ronan turns in an absolutely brilliant performance as a young Irish girl named Eillis, who is moving to a whole new place and starting out a new life. The film beautifully displays the feelings of homesickness, culture shock and being torn between two different places by the people around you. The film is very relatable and you can feel everything that Ronan's Eillis goes through as she must learn to adopt her new home and then as she must choose between her old life and her new one."
Brooklyn,97,87,audience,"Brooklyn preferisce essere un'esperienza più romanzata rispetto ad un ritratto realistico di in intero periodo storico. Tutto si basa su una sceneggiatura molto intensa e graziosa, che propone una trama semplice ma di grande impatto emotivo nello spettatore. La regia generale soddisfa ogni aspettativa, risultando delicata e sensibile per tutta la durata del film. Si riesce a dare un giusto peso narrativo ad ogni sua scena, garantendo una coerenza generale sempre sopra la media: nel complesso è un'esperienza solida, profonda e difficile da dimenticare."
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
Overall, however, Brooklyn is a pleasant film, but not an especially compelling one.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
A movie about decisions that makes all the right decisions.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
While there are no explosions and no real antagonist, it's one of those movies that goes straight to the heart of what it means to be human.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
To match the tonal invariability is the perfectly cast Ronan, who is naturally pleasant, seemingly without trying.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
Screenwriter Nick Hornby (An Education) and director John Crowley (Closed Circuit) also do a terrific job of building the dramatic tension between Eilis's old and new lives.

A low-key tribute to the better angels of American nature.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
Phenomenal performances from Saoirse Ronan and Emory Cohen help to elevate 1950s romantic drama Brooklyn in the 2015 adaptation.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
Brooklyn is sublime viewing; beautiful to look at and lovely to watch, with [Saoirse] Ronan presenting her most mature role to date.
 "

Brooklyn is a beautiful film, in both presentation, with its lush cinematography, and delicate execution.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
It is a very sweet, lovely movie that I highly recommend.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
Brooklyn actually harks back to the kind of escapist entertainment cinema offered in the 1950s. It's all rather lovely, if completely unchallenging.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
I was surprised at how enjoyable and skillfully made Brooklyn is: I cried when everyone else did and gasped when the rest of the audience did too, but in spite of its excellent art direction and affecting performances the film is mostly hokum.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
It's a lovely piece of cinema, and one of the best movies of 2015 to date.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
The look of 1950s Brooklyn and Ireland is beautiful-each glimpse more idyllic than the next to render the film a fairy tale of sorts...
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
There are no real words to describe how moving and emotionally satisfying this story is.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
An ode to homesickness and longing that also serves as an essential destination for theater-goers this Holiday season.
 "
Brooklyn,97,87,critic,"
As Eilis Lacey, Saoirse Ronan carries this film so splendidly that in any year that was not so utterly Brie Larson's, it would be a crime not to give her every award; you can practically see her eyes changing colors with her moods.

She's Funny That Way,44,35,audience,"I loved this movie! What a hidden gem. I must've missed it in 2014, as at the time I was busy planning the nuking of my NYC existence. Watching it on YouTube with the ads was only marginally annoying."
She's Funny That Way,44,35,audience,"If your not into watching alot of movies from the past (World War II era 1940's 1950's time period, you will not understand alot of the dialog and references to the past. I enjoyed this movie alot, being a fan of movies from the past."
She's Funny That Way,44,35,audience,"F*****k loved this film.  It's baffling to me this film got so poorly reviewed.  I loved almost every second of this witty, sharp comedy"
She's Funny That Way,44,35,audience,"For me, Jennifer Aniston steals the movie. Hilarious as the slightly mad psychiatrist. The rest of the cast is also strong. Laughed through most of this throw-back comedy."
She's Funny That Way,44,35,audience,A farce that is like a Woody Allen film without the angst.  Imogen Poots sparkles in her role.
She's Funny That Way,44,35,audience,"Horrible accent from Poots. Why can't they ever cast correctly. In fact, there were parts where her British accent trickled through. Tough to sit through and listen to the costar for too long. Moving on.  Cheers "
She's Funny That Way,44,35,audience,Probably the worst movie Iï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ve ever seen. What an insult to women. Talking about clueless. Bogdonavich should never tell a story about women again
She's Funny That Way,44,35,audience,"I'm not the first to say it, but this could not be described any more perfectly than as a bootleg Woody Allen Production.  Which, I suppose, would be a good thing if you like Woody Allen.  I guess the production values were ok?"
She's Funny That Way,44,35,audience,"Written and directed by Peter Bogdanovich (one of my favorites), this throwback to classic screwball comedies like ""Bringing Up Baby"" or ""It Happened One Night"" tells the story of the opening of a Broadway play by director Owen Wilson and playwright Will Forte. When Wilson crushes on an escort he calls to his hotel room one night, a charming Imogen Poots, she turns out to be an aspiring actress who later nails her audition for the aforementioned play and makes things complicated when Wilson's wife, who's one of the stars of the show (and who's being seduced by her on-stage co-star, Rhys Ifans) wants Poots to be her co-star over Wilson's objections. Things get even more complicated when Forte begins to crush on Poots over his shrewish psychologist girlfriend, Jennifer Aniston (who's also Poots' psychologist). And all that is established pretty much the first 25 minutes of the movie! For fan of classic comedies, ""She's Funny that Way"" is a real treat, but for modern audiences not attuned to the mannered style of old fashioned comedies, I'm not sure how well it would be received. Still, it's a pretty hard to resist cast, which also includes Richard Lewis and Cybill Shepherd as Poots' parents, Debi Mazar as her madam, as well as Tatum O'Neal, Colleen Camp, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Shannon, Joanna Lumley, Austin Pendleton, and Quentin Tarantino as himself. Overall, ""She's Funny That Way"" is not a classic, but it's a treat for film buffs."

The End of the Tour,92,81,audience,"""Mediocrity is contextual."" — DFW"
The End of the Tour,92,81,audience,"This movie made me reflect a lot on what it means to grow up. Here we have two 30+ year-olds struggling to find egocentric meaning in life. One has not yet found it and is searching desperately. One apparently has found it but seems to be crushed by how hollow it is. It is a depressing yet relieving story about a guy who can write a book that millions of people think is brilliant but cannot properly offer a guest room; cannot work up the courage to speak to a woman he likes; cannot limit his petty jealousy. Spoiler alert: my favorite line in the movie was on the plan, when DFW tells the reporter, ""this isn't real,"" meaning his article. How true. As for the acting, I think they did a wonderful job. I am left wondering if DFW was that monotone in real life, or had the same demeanor. Eisenburg does a really good job of confusing you about whether you like him, don't like him, sympathize with him or think he is really invading DFW's space that is none of his business (for selfish ends). The characters seem to find some meaningful resolution with each other by the end. If it were me, however, I would probably not be so moved by what they did. Because really, over a five day period, they didn't do much. Which is better, because it captures the mundanity that DFW feels, regardless of writing a ""great book."" Then again, I must remember that DFW was the next great American writer...and I guess you wouldn't really expect such a person to be as down-to-earth and confused as DFW actually was, and so willing to make a friend and be changed by the experience. This is a movie that will make you think, or even change you, I would imagine. Still, I do not idolize these characters."
The End of the Tour,92,81,audience,A truly heartfelt and endearing film. Siegel was amazing. He should have won awards for this movie. A great tribute to the greatest American writer of the 1990s.
The End of the Tour,92,81,audience,"I didn't know anything about Mr Wallace, but I'm a sucker for movies with good conversation Richard Linklater style. The acting is right on point and Ponsoldt engages you from minute one so much that it feels like your the third person inside the car."
The End of the Tour,92,81,audience,"Knowing next to nothing about David Foster Wallace, this movie intrigued me. I was interested in learning about DFW and the struggles in his life. The only problem is that author David Lipsky was so busy riding on DFW's coattails and making everything about himself -- that the DFW character gets lost in the story.
To make matters worse, many of the pearls of wisdom spoken by the DFW character were lifted verbatim from YouTube videos that were recorded long after the Rolling Stone interviews were supposed to have taken place. Making this screenplay seeming to be one in which great quotes were taken from DFW and then a different context was written to make them seem genuine.
I have not read (and have no interest) in reading Lipsky's memoirs about speniding a weekend with DFW in an effort to cash in on DFW's name. But this movie motivated me to learn more about DFW.
If you want to see a movie that's as cinematic as My Dinner with Andre, or as shallow (and coattail riding) as The Force Awakens -- then this flick just may be for you. But if you want to truly get an insight into David Foster Wallace - I recommend YouTube videos where he's interviewed by the likes of Charlie Rose and others... who understand that the purpose of an interview is to get to know the subject, not shine a light on yourself."
The End of the Tour,92,81,audience,"A slow moving, dialogue ridden movie that goes mostly nowhere, but the protagonist is intriguing enough and well played."
The End of the Tour,92,81,audience,"A criminally overlooked gem of a movie, The End Of The Tour paints a very human picture of late novelist David Foster Wallace, a man at odds with fame and much of what he sees in his everyday life. We see the way he deals with the sudden success and adoration while being essentially a shy man with limited social skills and a bundle of insecurities. He's a fascinating character, and I love how Jason Segel plays him. It's a performance that never gets talked about, but deserves all the acclaim it received. You can feel how tense he is, how unsure of himself he is even when he seems loose and relaxed, and when he comments on how much fun he's having or how much he's enjoying himself, his awkward stance and lack of eye contact suggest the very opposite. Jesse Eisenberg makes for a great counterbalance, pushing against Wallace, often too much on occasion, and the everchanging chemistry between the 2 leads is what keeps things interesting. It's a dialogue heavy film, but its brilliantly written and provides an insight into the mind of a man who was only on the public radar for a relatively short time, but who's impact is still felt to this day. If you have interest in the author or his work, then see this as soon as you can."
The End of the Tour,92,81,audience,"Yeah this movie is about an interview, that and somewhat subtly and not so subtly about much more... life, and the human experience. You will feel a bit of that watching this movie, and if you felt the pain of loneliness and pondering over your place in this world, this movie will mean more to you. David will become your friend even though he already is."

Jimmy's Hall,76,60,audience,Enjoyable but not one of Ken Loach's best.
Jimmy's Hall,76,60,audience,"A touching film about the man of small means and a big heart vs the man of great means and a small heart, Jimmy's Hall is based on the true story of Jimmy Gralton whose life is a very sad example of a man who just wants to spread a bit of happiness around and is opposed by people who fear change and hate those who promote it; a story that has been all too common throughout the history of humanity and, unfortunately, is still very much of heard of nowadays."
Jimmy's Hall,76,60,audience,A saddening political drama.  Recommended for those interested in Irish history.
Jimmy's Hall,76,60,audience,"This is cracking. We've put off watching this for months, i don't know quite why. It's very evocative of Irish Free State, circa 1932. There's stuff here about conflict between different factions post-independence that I wasn't aware of. Jimmy Gralton was a communist, and was eventually deported from his homeland to the USA. It's an uplifting tale, well narrated and acted, although I suspect it's more uplifting on screen than it was in real life. it's certainly been romanticised. A worthy watch nonetheless."
Jimmy's Hall,76,60,audience,"A story of social and religious injustice from a seldom seen period in film of the Irish Free State.  It's a steady Ken Loach film, but not near his best."
Jimmy's Hall,76,60,audience,"A teenager moves from the big city to a small town where rock music and dancing have been banned. His rebellious spirit shakes up the populace.

- FOOTLOOSE (1984) synopsis

Set during the Depression, a man returns to his home in the Irish countryside after ten years of living in the big city. Hoping to lead a quiet life, his rebellious spirit reawakens as he reopens a dance hall, shaking up the social order in the village.

- JIMMY'S HALL (2014) synopsis

After watching acclaimed director Ken Loach's latest film, JIMMY'S HALL, I have to wonder if at any point during the production someone turned to Loach and said, ""Um, Ken, this looks an awful lot like a Depression-era, Irish remake of FOOTLOOSE."" I would be shocked to hear that no one had noticed the similarity.

JIMMY'S HALL is a nicely shot period piece that fails due to its bad writing. Based on Donal O'Kelly's play, Jimmy Gralton's Dancehall, and adapted for the screen by Paul Laverty (who also wrote Loach's Palme d'Or winning film, THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY), JIMMY'S HALL tells the little-known story of James Gralton who, in 1933, became the only Irish citizen ever to have been deported from the country. Gralton had dual Irish and US citizenship, having immigrated to the States in 1909. While there, he worked a variety of jobs and, after witnessing first-hand the slave-like working conditions there, he became involved in trade union activity.

The film opens in 1932, ten years after the end of the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent establishment of the Irish Free State. Although there was much optimism after the war that Ireland would finally have self-determination, that feeling didn't last as ""the masters and the pastors"" were still in charge when the dust settled. Landowners were throwing tenant families off their land if they were in arrears on their rent, and church leaders were crushing dissidence in their parishes through a heady combination of coercion and intimidation.

It is at this time that Gralton returns home to the north-central county of Leitrim hoping to settle down and lead a ""quiet life"", but that is not to be. The town had lost its very popular community centre back in 1921 when the Black and Tans shut it down. It appears that the Powers-that-be saw (and still see, ten years on) dancing as that first step on the slippery slope that leads to the Red Menace taking over the Emerald Isle. Encouraged by his friends and the town's youth, Gralton decides to reopen the club. The place quickly becomes the focal point for the townsfolk, offering such subversive activities as poetry reading, drawing classes, boxing lessons and (gasp!) dancing. Gralton introduces his friends to jazz music, which they take to like people who suddenly find their shackles of oppression removed. Typically, Father Sheridan sees the Marxist devil at work here and he starts naming and shaming the younger members of this coffee society. If people start thinking for themselves, he feels, what's next?

Things come to a head with Gralton's arrest but he manages to elude the police and hide out for a few months. When the law finally does catch up with him, he is processed and put on a steamer to the US, never to see his ma and the shamrocks again.

There are few filmmakers who are as consistent in tackling working class themes as Loach, so it's not surprising that he would take on this story. Unfortunately, it is so thin there's not much to work with. Instead we're given long dancing sequences to fill out the film's running time of 109 minutes. Granted, they're nice to watch but do they really tell us about Gralton's politics? Aside from the less than rousing public oration he gave when he and his friends returned a farmhouse to its tenant and the stilted dressing down he gave to the reverend, we don't get a strong sense of Gralton's Marxist ideals. Where are all the scenes of him discussing and debating the virtues of communism with his friends and mother? The film really hit rock bottom when, at the end, one of the town's young women assured Jimmy that they'll keep on dancing even after he's gone. Really? They'll just keep dancing? That's the extent of their commitment to building a fair and just world?

Following the barely lukewarm reception the film received when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2014, Loach, now 79, downplayed his previous comments that this would be his last film. For his sake, it would be sad if JIMMY'S HALL would be his farewell to filmmaking."

Jimmy's Hall,76,60,audience,"Situada en la Irlanda de los años 20, esta película dirigida por del prestigioso director Ken Loach (ganador de la Palma de Oro en Cannes por ""The Wind That Shakes The Barley"") cuenta la historia de Jimmy Gralton (un carismático Barry Ward), un hombre que vuelve a su hogar después de 10 años de exilio en Nueva York, para reabrir un gran salón comunitario para que las personas de su poblado puedan bailar, leer y compartir juntas.  El problema radica en que el sacerdote del poblado se opone a la idea, la cual se ve como las intenciones perversas de un comunista. La denuncia y el sesgo político, una constante en el cine de Loach, está más que presente en ""Jimmy's Hall"", pero también está ahí la humanidad de sus personajes y la delicadeza del tratamiento del tema.  En estos tiempos de fanatismo político y religioso, ""Jimmy's Hall"" es una película importante y pertinente, pero también es un retrato de época evocador y bello."

Far From the Madding Crowd,84,75,audience,"Having loved this book since I first read it back in high school, I was keen to watch this movie when it appeared on my online streaming service. I shouldn't have bothered, sadly. The cinematography is absolutely brilliant, pretty much the best from the films that have been made to date, and the casting some of true characters is superb. That was where the good points ended, because screenplay writer David Nichols has massacred the storyline of the book to the point that it's completely unrecognisable, and resembles some basic coming of age love story rather than even trying to stay true to Hardy's premise. All I can think is that those that rated it highly on Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb have never read the novel! One to avoid if you like your classics!"
Far From the Madding Crowd,84,75,audience,"There is something terribly wrong with this movie. Is it the story? Well, yes: it is a 'pulp romance novel', about three handsome men chasing a handsome woman. (It even comes with some far too convenient plot twists, for an age when divorce still was out of the question.) Still, sometimes these sugar sweet love stories can be enjoyable, if they are dished up in an original and believable way. In this film though, almost everything is cliché. The romantic camerawork, the semiclassical music (with a small exception in a winter scene, when we finally hear some unusual piano-tones) and above all: the script! It is so much like a summary of the events that all characters seem unnatural, almost like puppets performing the story. The dialogues never contain any unexpected detail and are often too sparse. Most of all Schoenaerts's role is suffering from this. Here he is almost nothing more than a photo model, every girl's (or guy's) dream, whereas we know he can pull off some top class acting. All this said, if you are in a lazy mood and don't mind some generic romantic stuff in a lush production, you may enjoy this one. And then forget it again immediately afterwards."

Far From the Madding Crowd,84,75,audience,"Absolutely breathtaking scenery and cinematography. The sound track was also beautiful. Mr. Oaks was, to me, the central character in every way. The film/book would have gripped me had it been based on his story line as the protagonist rather than the selfish, silly character of Miss. Everdene. I applaud that Hardy wrote a narrative about an independent and stubborn woman who needed no man, yet I'm so disappointed that he throws all that wonderfulness away when Bethsheba becomes the subordinate to little prick of a man. So well acted was Mr. Oaks by the Belgian heartthrob that I wanted to jump into the tv and tell him 'I'll marry you Mr. Oaks! Pick me, she's totally unworthy!' This film could've ended in the first 15 minutes for me. "

While We're Young,84,51,audience,"It's not as good as The Squid & The Whale, but it is another good example of what Baumbach likes to do... A show of honestly written, and well-directed characters who tell a story that hankers after youth and associated freedoms, whilst at the same time aspiring to be more 'adult'. All of them (all the while) battle to be different, 'better', emboldened, enlightened and needed, but come to a place that shows they are who they are, and the strengths they have individually, enhance what they share with those closest to them"

While We're Young,84,51,audience,what is the take away supposed to be? that older ppl cannot just act like younger ppl to be happy (or something along those lines)? But if adam driver was not a bad person in the movie then the couple would have still been happy hanging with young ppl... the movie makes no sense. and the ending...so a baby is what will save a relationship or is a symbol of a saved relationship? Not only is that ridiculous but it is an unearned ending. the movie is pretentious and is incoherent in its messaging.
While We're Young,84,51,audience,The first half is good where we see the older couple try to integrate with the younger couple but the main plot which then unfolds just is not enough to maintain the story. A bit of a damp squib ending.
While We're Young,84,51,audience,"I love the cast in this but I'm not sure if I'm laughing with them or at that them, laughing regardless and enjoyed Baumbach's screenplay although the delivery didn't feel as sincere as in his as his later films."
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
An exhaustive and acid analysis on accepting the passage of time and leaving youth behind. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
It starts off as a familiar comedy of postmodern manners before opening up and embracing a wider world. Cheer up, it says to Gen X. Everybody's in the same boat. Get over yourselves.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
While We're Young stumbles in pacing but contains a few sentimental moments and laughs that a mature crowd will enjoy.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
It's rambling, tonally indecisive and contains no one as charming as Frances Ha, but this well-meaning spiritual sequel shines for its wry humour.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
A mostly breezy movie that's mostly very enjoyable and would have been great save for the uneven drama that emerges near the end making the film more of a downer than it needed to be.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
Features a great cast with a great idea, but an idea that is never fully realized. It's a pay off not worthy of the film's very good opening half.

A Poignant Comedy Made For Adults
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
If, in truth, the actual narrative never truly breaks free from Baumbach's conceptual concerns, it's still a really interesting watch just because those ideas are so prescient
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
While We're Young is wickedly on the nose in its depiction of men so self-obsessed they can't see who they really are - or who their friends are.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
Has one of the smartest scripts you will see delivered this year. It's also arguably Baumbach's most mainstream movie to date.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
Baumbach is too subtle to offer simple moral lessons. Instead he pushes us to see that there's more going on here.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
Filmmaker Noah Baumbach has infused much of While We're Young with a loose, freewheeling quality that's impossible to resist...
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
While We're Young has the golden feel of a lifetime's obsession, the sense that Baumbach has spent so long observing the ghastliness of hipsters in Brooklyn that he now simply has to get it all down in one long, dramatic evacuation.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
Baumbach's intelligence and uniqueness are evident in While We're Young. On the whole, though, the movie seems like it got lost on its search for some creative and human truth.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
As a non-breeder, I admit to being pleased to find a rare film that dares to stand up for the idea that your life is valid even without children.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
It's a worthwhile field of enquiry, made into a strangely self-satisfied film.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
Among other things, Noah Baumbach's very funny While We're Young is a rumination on the Long Tail, the theory that pop culture remains accessible long after it's originally created.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
The problem could simply be that Baumbach is too close to the material to know when to pull back.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
Few movies are as perfect in showing the duality of ageing generations simultaneously distrusting the young whilst wishing they were young again - and even fewer are as funny and insightful as this.
 "
While We're Young,84,51,critic,"
Their foibles are ideal material for Baumbach who uses this fender-bender between Gen X and Millennials to tackle something real-rapidly shifting ideas of art, truth, and integrity.

Maps to the Stars,61,44,audience,"Granted, the narrative to David Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars meanders all over the place and is, more often than not, confusing.  Granted, the characters in the film, without exception, lack anything even remotely related to redeeming values as they dabble in murder, assault, addiction, incest, arson, greed, and grotesque narcissism, just to start scraping the surface.  Despite all of this, it is strangely compelling viewing as Cronenberg skewers Hollywood values as only Cronenberg can.  There are great performances from top to bottom, some interesting directorial choices, and enough interesting scenarios to keep you glued to the screen.  And it is going to leave a horrible taste in your mouth."

The problem with Maps to the Stars is not in its stars, but in its script. Penned by screenwriter and novelist Bruce Wagner, it's morbid and muddled.

A maudlin brew of wacky circumstances and over-the-top flourishes that sometimes work, but, more often than not, fall flat the longer running the time wears on.

It's an unoriginal concept but rarely has this story been told with such visual flair, narrative ingenuity and, despite a character uttering a pivotal fact in the first act, mystery.
 "
Maps to the Stars,61,44,critic,"
Maps revels in Hollywood's many grotesqueries yet crucially lacks the cool wit and intelligence that comes hand-in-hand with a Cronenberg on his A-game. Overbearingly catty, there's little actual meat underneath all the ghoulish cosmetics.

... as fitting, seductive and gruesome as it is, Maps to the Stars somewhat feels at odds with the director's insistence that the film is anything but a satirical apocalypse.
 "
Maps to the Stars,61,44,critic,"
Maps to the Stars romanticizes the mentally ill and their darkness. Agatha and Benjie aren't real characters. They're incest victims, sexual predators, half-baked half-sketched people-types.
 "

Part of what's exciting about Maps to the Stars, David Cronenberg and Bruce Wagner's new film about Los Angeles, is the inventiveness and ease with which it stakes out a dark corner of territory under the bright California sun.

Timbuktu,98,77,audience,There are moments in this film of real beauty and also moments where it genuinely moves you.  The disparate strands never really tie together though and the unifying theme of 'aren't Jihadists mean!' isn't deep enough or nuanced enough to hang the whole film on.
Timbuktu,98,77,audience,"Although it is difficult to dislike a film with such gorgeous visuals and powerful messages, I also think that, because of this elements, should have been way better. It is like it fell short of its potential. Nevertheless ""Timbuktu"" its a view I would recommend, because it shows realities so far from us that makes them so easy to forget."
Timbuktu,98,77,audience,"I really wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately, it wasn't for me."
Timbuktu,98,77,audience,"To me the visual of the film is extremely insipid, savorless, amazingly dull and plainly disappointing! And in that area, someone will have to explain to me how cinematographer Sofian El Fani, who once again reveals himself as an amateur, actually did get a credit for this movie. Very rarely do we see technical challenges. The movie's visualization is so technically repetitive and mind-numbing that it makes the whole movie extremely boring (how many viewers did say they were checking their watch!). Timbuktu's stunning sandy deserts, lakes and caved houses, which should have been splendidly rendered, are regrettably reduced to being consistently filmed with the same elementary shots over and over. It could have been merely OK for a documentary (which the movie was supposed to be BTW). What makes the filming approach so tedious is that Sofian El Fani fails to convey emotions through camera angles (kind of reminded me of La vie d'Adèle where El Fani makes such an excessive use of close-ups that it becomes unbearably repetitive to the viewer).

So unless there was a political move to credit Tunisian film crew members, such as El Fani, (Original Score award to Amine Bouhafa was well deserved though), there is no technical basis whatsoever for him receiving this award for best cinematography. Globally, this film probably moved Western World viewers -- that's why it actually got credited--, but it no manner does it contribute to cinema or art."
Timbuktu,98,77,audience,"As visually arresting as shatteringly startling, this Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film mustering imageries of religious oppression is a cri de coeur for the barbarous Islamic military rule at the titular city."
Timbuktu,98,77,audience,Un excellent film avec une grande immersion sur la vie sous la charma sans prise de position
Timbuktu,98,77,audience,"Beautifully shot with some particularly powerful scenes, 'Timbuktu' is a poignant story of villagers day-to-day lives made increasingly difficult by the tyrannical Jihadists who have occupied their territory, how life and death is decided by them in a nonchalant manner, and the stifling hypocrisy of it all. The deliberately slow pace may have some viewers constantly checking their watches, and the film does seem to get lost in the magnitude of what it's trying to say, but it is, ultimately, an affecting experience that will leave some sort of impression on its audience."
Timbuktu,98,77,audience,"Timbuktu tries to show the brutality of arbitrary application of sharia law through beautifully photographed scenes of characters and neighborhoods subjected to newfound and nonsensical strictures, like prohibition of music and soccer.  But the value of that indictment of sharia is outweighed by the film's ambling, nearly random plot development.  And the protagonist who falls victim to the jihadists himself insensibly tries to solve his property dispute with a gun, muddying the film's message.  Despite its overwhelmingly positive reception among reviewers, the film leaves the viewer more with pointlessness than persuasion."
Timbuktu,98,77,audience,Very strong with a powerful message.
Timbuktu,98,77,audience,"Fascinating; heart wrenching

There's a lot of restraint and subtlety in director Abderrahmane Sissako's tragic delineation of what it's like to live under an ISIS takeover of a Muslim community. And there's a beautiful artistry in the way he shows the barbarism of Sharia law so horrifically played out while the subjugation of women is made clear. (Actually the women in the movie stand strong against the subjugation.) Thus the evil of the ""jihadists"" (ISIS is never named but a black flag is flown) is contrasted with the normal lives of Muslim people.

Sissako, who also wrote the script, is careful to make this distinction-a distinction that a good part of the world is currently working on. It is not Muslims who are bad; it is the extremists. Yet I could not help but think as I watched this with the incessant talk of God will's, etc., that maybe, just maybe, the tribalism of religion itself is at fault. How horrible it is to live with the constant thought and expression that it is all God's doing (with a little help from the forces of evil), and that we are just pawns in some absurd game played by a nearly omnipotent power that can send you to heaven or hell based on the very behaviors built into your psyche.

Well, such would apply to most other religions as well I suppose. So an indictment of Islam is not appropriate. Nonetheless the intense religious climate of the movie was for me almost tyrannical. I felt so sad for all the poor ignorant people and again was reminded of the saying ""willful ignorance is the only sin"" and again told myself that the only way out of the morass of the Middle East is education leading to enlightenment.

The film is in Arabic, French and a bit of English with English subtitles. A lot of what is said is not translated into the subtitles, but little is lost in the comprehension. There are scenes of great beauty contrasted with ugly violence. Beautiful music is played and sung, and there is a soccer game played without a ball. Such is the absurdity of life under the jihadists, who are really just thugs using a distorted vision of Islam in order to justify their crimes.

I'm No Longer Here,98,87,audience,It's been a long time since I haven't seen a movie that represents so well the experience of being poor in Latin America. To put it in words it is hard enough but seeing this movie clears any doubt that there is a way to describe those feelings. Mixing shortage with violent context but still wanna dance and laugh at every street corner is what makes this movie a nostalgia recipe for us as latinos.  Of course is an Academy Award worthy!
I'm No Longer Here,98,87,audience,"I'm No Longer Here (Ya no estoy aqui) is a strange movie in its mix of genres and a memorable protagonist, It is also way too specific in its cultural elements.

The film hops back and forth between the story of why he had to leave Mexico and his various experiences trying to make it as an undocumented resident of the city. There is a kind of poetry here in the movie that I really liked, and how the dancing connects his old and new lives while trying to make it in NY and the earlier times when he was the unmistaken dance leader of Los Terkos. The dancing seems to be a fusion of more traditional dance that we see among US native tribes, and the dancing at times reminded me as well of the breakdancing subculture. The actor who plays Ulises is wonderful. The experiences Ulises had in NYC were not always as well developed and powerful as they could be, but much of the film's beauty resulted from the contrasts between his life in Monterrey and his life of trying to scrape by in the US. Big thumbs up from me – this film is Mexico's Best International Film entry for the 93rd Academy Awards, and it is carried by Netflix!"
I'm No Longer Here,98,87,audience,"Cuando Netflix me sugirió la película ""Ya No Estoy Aquí"" lo primero que pensé fue que era una comedia dramática para adolescentes más, de esas que se han vuelto populares en algunas producciones mexicanas y que nos tiene acostumbrado a ver esta plataforma. Sin embargo, cuando me dispuse a verla, me asombré de la joyita de película que me encontré.
Un filme que fue estrenado en la plataforma de streaming de Netflix y que narra la historia de Ulises (Juan Daniel García), el líder de un grupo de jóvenes muy apasionados a la cumbia en la ciudad de Monterrey, México; y quien, por un terrible malentendido con una pandilla local, lo empuja a cruzar la frontera de los Estados Unidos para mantenerse con vida.
La historia fue escrita y dirigida por Fernando Frías de Parra, un mexicano y cineasta que debuta con este gran largometraje después de participar en cine documental y pequeñas producciones que estuvieron presentes en diferentes festivales de cine en México.
 ""Ya no estoy aquí"" es un filme que destaca por dos puntos clave. Uno, son las actuaciones de los personajes junto con la dirección. Y dos, la exploración en historias ignoradas por las grandes productoras de cine.
En primer lugar, la película cuenta con actuaciones muy buenas que reflejan naturalidad, transmitiendo la sensación de realismo en las acciones que realizan los personajes. Cabe destacar que los actores no son profesionales, sino que el director decide seguir el camino de ""Roma (2018)"" y contrata a personas con vivencias parecidas a la de la historia.
De esta manera, la película logra un mayor impacto en las emociones que los personajes transmiten, haciendo que el público se encariñe y empatice con ellos, en especial con el protagonista de la historia.
Una historia que es contada de forma comparativa entre el pasado y el presente de Ulises, haciendo que poco a poco el espectador vaya conociendo y adentrándote en el sentir del personaje con su cultura. Y si bien, no es una película perfecta, ya que en algunos momentos se vuelve lenta, con sub tramas que no terminan en nada y un desarrollo por momentos difuso, no le quita mérito al clímax que logra la cinta.
En este sentido, el gran trabajo que realiza en dirección Fernando Frías de Parra, logra que estos personajes se vuelvan un retrato dentro de una sociedad mexicana. Esto ya que las caracterizaciones y el uso de los escenarios encajan perfectamente en el filme, algo que se debe posiblemente a la influencia del cine documental en el director.
Aunque, de la misma manera es de alagar la excelente fotografía que realiza Damián García, quien logra unas composiciones y movimientos de cámara muy llamativos. Lo cuales se centran en los detalles que transmiten las sensaciones de soledad y pérdida. Algo que se acompaña muy bien de la selección de la banda sonora que se enfoca en presentar la música tradicional de la cultura a la que Ulises representa, por lo que, cuando finaliza la cinta te quedas deseando escuchar más cumbia.
En segundo lugar, el mensaje que busca dejar la cinta es muy bueno, ya que se centra en los cambios que puede sufrir una persona en su crecimiento personal. Apelando a temas como el sentido de pertenencia a una cultura, el paso a la adultez, y, la soledad o nostalgia presentes en esas circunstancias de cambio a los cuales a veces nos obliga la vida.
Igualmente, el mensaje se mezcla con una crítica social manifestada en los escenarios, los personajes y la propia historia en sí. Una crítica que no se siente forzada a que el espectador la entienda, sino que esta se muestra naturalmente como fondo y gira en torno a las realidades que viven muchas personas en Latinoamérica.
Unas realidades que muchas veces son olvidadas por las productoras de cine, las cuales siguen otros modelos de historias más hollywoodenses. Por lo que, el impacto que logra y causa esta película, tanto en su puesta en escena y en su mensaje, puede funcionar como una fuente de inspiración para contar y visibilizar otras historias que existen dentro de la región."
I'm No Longer Here,98,87,audience,"The film takes its time and shows difficult situations unsentimentally, yet each event still landed with me. As a dancer, especially, I related to Ulises's living to dance. Three days later, I'm still going over the film in my mind. Worth a watch, for sure."
I'm No Longer Here,98,87,audience,"Captivating visuals, music and dance provide a beautifully vibrant backdrop to this ultimately sad story of alienated youth, undocumented immigrants, street gangs and poverty. The sequences in Queens, New York, are important to the film, but ultimately pale in comparison to the vibrant street life in Monterrey."

Sin,93,,audience,"See it for the photography, see it for the history, see it for the irony, see it for the beauty, just see the damn movie.  Within 15 minutes you are both startled by the reality of the historical portrayal and amused by the hilarity of circumstances as they existed.  Many people make movies about history, few attempt and require so little romanticism, because it was Michelangelo, the work speaks for itself.  So we are left to take in the reality in which the art was produced and and whos behest.  The who being the Church and the families who controlled it.  Humanity, the Holy, and everything in-between can be seen in contrast to some of the most beautiful creations of a single man.  A man, anxious, filled with doubt and the debt of a life of overpromising and overdelivering.  A beautiful portrayal of a beautiful man."
Sin,93,,audience,"This movie is a hidden gem of Russian cinematography. I suddenly encountered it today because of a recommendation from a friend and I am not disappointed at all. I love the aspect ratio of this movie, I love it's plot and I love the setting. The setting is amazing and absolutely fulfills the Renaissance era of Italy. I am very amazed by actors, especially the one that plays Michelangelo because of how well he deals with his role. The plot is interesting because, let's be honest, there is not many films that are based on that era. The life of Michelangelo is not something everybody would be interested in, which is why I think it's not popular. I am very proud of Russian film industry, because something like this movie exists, if someone showed me a frame from this film I would have never said that Russian people took part in it. It is unique because of it not being a domestic drama or a war movie, as that's what Russian film industry is famous for. I love history and I think that this movie is historically accurate, has a lot of intense moments, as well as amazing allegories, especially on religion, which are very thought provoking. This is not a movie everybody would understand, but many would find it's setting pleasing. The Russian dubbing is amazing, so I would recommend watching this movie in Russian with subtitles. A great 8/10, if you love historical biographical movies with some taste of thought provoking drama — go for it, but I don't guarantee that you will understand it."

17 Blocks,100,,audience,"Culled from 20 years of raw video footage, this up-close look at a Washington, DC family afflicted by the perils of drug addiction and gun violence examines the challenges of dealing with temptation, fending off negative influences and seeking redemption. In doing so, this gripping documentary tells a story of questionable choices, profound heartbreak and the search for inspiration to turn things around. While the film sometimes comes across as a slice of life vehicle at the outset, it definitely grows stronger with the passage of time, presenting material that's increasingly more involving and heartrending as it proceeds. Director Davy Rothbart's sensitive but uncensored look at a family in crisis deservedly earned a 2020 Independent Spirit Award nomination for the competition's Truer Than Fiction Award, a quality that comes through loud and clear in this engaging offering."

Lapsis,93,72,audience,"Ladies and gentlemen, your 2021 best sleep inducing movie. Have at it."
Lapsis,93,72,audience,"Caught this on a whim and it didn't disappoint. Smart, funny, political but not preachy, and super well made. Super impressed by this movie, and the score is amazing too and written by the writer/director!"
Lapsis,93,72,audience,"A weirdly smart low-budget alternate universe sci-fi social satire, that doesn't deliver at the finish line.

Documentary/short filmmaker Noah Hutton scored, wrote, edited and directed this genius little out-of-the-ordinary minimalist sci-fi gem. It's a weirdly smart, very low-budget alternate universe sci-fi social satire, that was so well directed, shot, scored and cast, you actually feel engaged that you're in this Nolan-esque parallel universe.

Dean Imperial's performance excellently portrayed that (alternate universe) 1980's blue-collar worker struggling to make ends meet, that's willing to take risks to get ahead. The upstate NY forest setting was well used and shot. What really impressed me was how perfect Hutton's score was. It was right up there with the eeriness sound in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. Had his score not been that good, the viewer may have been unconvinced of this alternate universe, and that this was a simple cheaply done low budget film in a forest.

What sadly failed this film, was better/faster pacing, and a shorter runtime of its 108 mins, that felt much longer. There just wasn't enough substance to fill the runtime, and the pacing made it that much more aggravating. There were many irrelevant and long dragged out/unnecessary scenes, with plot and technical issues. What made it worse, is that Hutton did such a great job keeping you engaged and in suspense enough to hang on until the end, that ultimately failed to deliver anything satisfying to his audience to make the ending worth waiting for.

Nevertheless, it's a good one-time-viewing film. It may not be for everyone, and really, it wasn't for me, as I'm an adrenaline and action junkie, but I also do appreciate unique and great filmmaking, and Hutton delivered that - on a very low budget."
Lapsis,93,72,audience,"Love the low-tech sci-fi aesthetic, especially the robots, which I found to be very cute. The original score does a lot of great work, enhancing both the humor and the darker elements."

Featuring a beautifully realized futuristic vision and spotlighting relevant themes in the age of Amazon, Lapsis deserves your attention despite its flaws and missed potential.
 "
Lapsis,93,72,critic,"
It's a shame that Lapsis begins and ends on such a disappointing note, because the material sandwiched in-between presents the struggles of American life in a creative, interesting way, making it worth a mild recommendation.
 "
Lapsis,93,72,critic,"
Lapsis says and does a lot with its lo-fi aesthetics because it knows when to utilize its modest budget on computer enhancements and when to let its cast take the reins.

Head-scratching non-ending aside, 'Lapsis' creates a fascinating world and fills it with intrigue and colorful, compelling characters.

Dara of Jasenovac,60,91,audience,"Excellent movie... very difficult to actually reflect the horrific acts and bestial forms of murder and torture perpetuated upon the mostly Serbian victims of the Ustasha (Croatian) run concentration camps in these regions during WW2.   Over 700,000 perished in Jasenovac camps alone and the Ustaha regime at the time had an official doctrine to convert 1/3 of all Orthodox Christian Serbs in the regions under their control to Catholicism; expel 1/3; and murder 1/3.  Younger Serb children were often taken away and brainwashed to become young Ustasha (like the Ottoman empire did with Janissaries) or given away to Catholic households to be renamed and raised Catholic.   The story of this holocaust needs to be told."
Dara of Jasenovac,60,91,audience,"This movie is Serbian propaganda, history is el diablo. Croats/Ustase in WW2 did killed in Jasenovac many Serbs but also Muslims, jews, gypsy's and so on. That is fact about this genocide, but this movies is pure Serbian propaganda and it is shame."
Dara of Jasenovac,60,91,audience,"Incredible and gut wrenching film made in the region in which it occurred - in the Balkans - Serbis and Croatia - the Serbs are the target of the Croatians and as the German's had the most concentration camps in Europe in WWII, the little known but finally emerging fact of the genocide and holocaust that occurred in this region (now approx. Yugoslavia area) is heart wrenching.  A superb film done in sub titles spoken in Slavic, it is a must see!  Open your eyes and you will see a take on the history that engulfed these people as many other diverse groups around the world have been made into slaves, and then exterminated.  Beautifully acted, directed - hope it gets an award!"
Dara of Jasenovac,60,91,audience,"Follows the story of a young girl named Dara who is sent to a concentration camp in Croatia during World War 2.
Untold and hidden stories after almost 70 years show the evil that was done to Serbs, the gypsy population and Jews during the Second World War in Croatia. To never be forgotten.
The film is more spectacular and less documentary, which is the choice of producer and director and aims to provoke emotions and show some of the greatest horrors that happened during the Second World War."
Dara of Jasenovac,60,91,audience,"Bob Dylan once said ""If you have slave running through your blood or are a descent of the Ku Klux Klan, black people can sense that. It remains to this day. Just as Jews can sense Nazi blood, or as Serbs can sense Croat blood."" This is no coincidence. Genocide in Independent State of Croatia is notorious and Dylan, who has a keen awareness of the worst oppression, like most Jews of his generation, is well aware of the Ustashe crimes in Jasenovac, a death camp that reigns supreme in terms of barbarity. It is also not coincidence that Croats sued Bob Dylan for expressing this very apt comparison - and lost. You do not silence Bob Dylan, a voice of conscience of the Western world. 

Is it then surprising that this movie, entirely based on documented and well established happenings inside of Jasenovac horrific death camp, is lobbied against by Croatian state, that shamelessly denies holocaust especially when it concerns Serbian victims? Is it any surprise that screenwriter, herself as a child having to flee Croatian army that was completing genocide started in the 40s by expelling the entire population of Krajina, birthplace of Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla, and killing mercilessly hundreds that could not flee, most aged over 80 or 90 - that this screenwriter, Natasa Drakulic, has to fear for her life as she daily receives death threats, promises that she will be raped and skinned and slaughtered?

The movie has great music, acting, cinematography, script based entirely on historical fact, every detail well documented, even though some of the barbarity had to be watered down, like the musical chairs scene which in real Jasenovac was played for the amusement of the Ustashe with children, not adults. Is it any surprise that 14 members of the Nikola Tesla's immediate family were murdered in Jasenovac, a subject for a new movie by Kusturica, yet Croats claim Tesla as their own? Is it then any surprise that Croats were described by famous Serbian poet in the 40s as the bravest people in the world, not because they are fearless, but because they are utterly shameless?"
Dara of Jasenovac,60,91,audience,"I am speechless. For those who have any bit of humanity this movie is a deeply emotional experience. Yes, I have seen Schindler's list, and Pianist and Sophie's Choice, but this is something else. A movie so brutal, it is hard to believe that such insults of bastardized beings in a human form ever existed. Yet they did and they do exist today. Hard to believe so many neo-Nazi holocaust deniers are in Croatia today, and that they threaten the screenwriter. History teaches us that monsters are hiding among us, pretending to be civilized and normal people, yet soaked in their nativist hatred.  This is perhaps the most important movie I have recently seen. Croatia needs to undergo a through denazification ASAP, and in the meantime needs to be discounted from the list of places whose inhabitants are worthy to subscribe to the human race. Until they undergo a deep soul searching process and kneel on the graveyards of the Ustasha victims begging their victims to be admitted back, until they reject the criminal ideology and holocaust denial garnished with lowest hypocrisy known to mankind. What they do instead speaks about some collective delusional hatred, not even neo-nazis are so blatantly embracing worst crimes ever committed on this lonely planet."
Dara of Jasenovac,60,91,audience,"This movie break new ground. With death threats against the screenwriter by Croatian holocaust deniers, it is tough. But truth prevails ultimately. This docudrama is very sad, and very important. It paves a way for other movies that are now being filmed about this supressed topic. Zafranovic Lordan films Children of Kozara aboth those children that got slaughtered in Jasenovac. Kusturica films Jasenovac Auschwitz of the Balkans, about family of Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla that got slaughtered in Jasenovac. The Croats made two inventions themselves, a bowtie and serb cutter knife. They would have used the serb cutter knife on Tesla had he remained i his Krajina birthplace, have no doubts about that."
Dara of Jasenovac,60,91,audience,"It is absolutely stunning piece of filmart. First Pasolini Salo, then Sofias choice, then Shindler list and Pianist, and finally Dara of Jasenovac death kamp. Very daring in showing the absolute worst kind of inhumanity that shocked even the SS. Brutal, captivating, and and arresting. Pure art that does not sugarcoat the Kroates. We have a saying - Got save us from starvation, black death and Kroaten. This movie tells why is it so,"

Two of Us,97,76,audience,"This is a phenomenal film. Economical, smart, very empathetic writing combined with equally empathetic, confident directing and excellent use of tone and editing make for one of the finest films of the year, and as good a romance as I saw from 2020 or 2021, so far. That all says so much about director Filippo Meneghetti. 
Sukowa and Chevallier are truly exceptional. It's like they've embodied these roles; like two stage actors on a two year run of the same play. So authentic is their chemistry together. So glad they didn't have Mado as some flailing, mumbling mess like Hopkins in Legends of the Fall. 
Nice supporting work by Drucker and Benazeraf. 
I've seen Minari as a nominee (and winner) for Best Foreign/Non-English Language film from several awards groups. Personally, Two of Us is twice the movie Minari is; much more powerful emotionally and cerebrally.

Two of Us,97,76,audience,"I enjoyed this movie, but the ""psycho"" wasn't psychotic enough for me. It bothered me, too, that no one ever mentioned the disappearance of a treasured item. Sad ending, but unforgettable."
Two of Us,97,76,audience,A moving and heartfelt story proving that love and its hardships are not reserved for teenagers.
Two of Us,97,76,audience,"How and who we love has undergone tremendously liberating changes in recent years, but, for some seniors, who remember a time when such taboos could not be revealed, the past painfully lingers on into the present. So it is for an aging French woman who is unable to tell her secret to her adult children, leaving her longtime lover on the sidelines when a tragic event disrupts their happiness and lives together. Director Filippo Meneghetti's debut narrative feature is an intensely gripping and moving work, one that grabs viewers by the collar and makes the frustration experienced by its protagonists truly palpable -- and infuriating. The superb performances by Barbara Sukowa and Martine Chevallier are riveting and heartfelt, achieving powerful impact with gestures as simple as facial expressions and piercing views into their eyes. There are a few incidents in the narrative that seem a bit far-fetched, but they're compensated for by everything else this release has to offer, already a multiple awards season nominee and a shortlist contender for best international film at the Oscars. The pain and warmth of this one must be experienced by anyone with a conscience -- or a pulse -- to see that, no matter how far we have come, there's always more ground still to be made up."
Two of Us,97,76,audience,"Two of Us is such a beautiful romance film that is uniformly strong in pacing, direction, acting performances and dialogue, but it is especially deserving of praise for its very grounded in reality, melodrama-lacking approach to storytelling that made the movie more believable and elegant. The final scene is touching and the emotional engagement here is undeniable."

Meneghetti aims for liberating release, but he never reaches the desired catharsis, because his stale nag of a movie is hopelessly stuck in the past.

Despite its skittish inference that Mado's stroke is a manifestation of her own self-denial, [It's] ultimately less interested in judging her for that choice than it is in exploring how some of life's most significant choices can only be made together.
 "
Two of Us,97,76,critic,"
Meneghetti's debut is always visceral and sometimes shocking. It's familiar and it's rare. It's not a movie I'll probably watch again, but it's also not one I'll soon forget.

True Mothers,90,100,audience,"While True Mothers is very well acted, quite moving at times and it deals with an important subject matter, it is ultimately only strong in the very well made first half while the second half was overly sprawling and messy in pacing and structure.

True Mothers,90,100,critic,"
A beautiful and emotionally rich meditation on the complex notion of motherhood that shows that the essential step in becoming mother is the subjective assumption of the signifier 'Mother'.

Kawase takes her time with the source material, leaning into the split focus when she could have told the same story as effectively in a more linear fashion. Still, there's no denying the potent emotion of the story...

True Mothers is a wistful ode to the infinite forms that family can take, a cogent assertion that there is no one-size-fits-all definition of motherhood.
 "
True Mothers,90,100,critic,"
Japan's Naomi Kawase is among the tenderest of filmmakers - you can often sense her caring presence off-camera, in a good way - and her latest, ""True Mothers,"" is a fine example of this Cannes-honored director's sensitivity and lyricism.

 "
True Mothers,90,100,critic,"
True Mothers is one of Naomi Kawase's best films to date, a thoughtful drama about the shame associated with unconventional motherhood.

Atlantis,97,29,audience,Nice cinematography but movie is slow and has many repetitive sequences. Not quite what I expected in an award-winning film...
Atlantis,97,29,audience,"Though singularly artistic in its vision and earnestly noble in its intent, this Ukrainian offering about life in the near future after the end of its protracted conflict with Russia struggles to find its traction, endlessly meandering and relying on far too many pregnant pauses and excessively long, lingering shots to make the film work. This visual attempt at creating a sense of bleak yet profound insight, unfortunately, fails to successfully conceal what is essentially a thin underlying narrative about a troubled former soldier seeking to adjust to life in peacetime in a land that has been morally and environmentally decimated by the conflict. It also doesn't help that there's virtually no back story about the protagonist and little information about the war, which may leave many viewers out in the cold as to what they're watching. What's more, it's puzzling that this release has been misleadingly labeled a sci-fi tale when, in fact, it's more properly characterized as a piece of dystopian political speculation, one that metaphorically seeks to echo the fate of the fabled lost continent. In all, the picture is certainly laudable for its valiant effort at making a weighty statement, but, regrettably, its pacing and overall execution weigh it down, trying viewer patience rather than offering meaningful enlightenment."
Atlantis,97,29,audience,"Artistic visualizations within 106 minutes of boredom. They say there was a story here. If there was, it could've been told in a 1 page comic strip.

Yes, the cinematography in this film was outstanding. The choice of colors and the sets made this film an artistic visualization. But 106 minutes of a goes-nowhere story makes you want to fast forward to the end, then replay it on mute with your favorite music blaring over the stereo.

Critics are raving at writer and director Valentyn Vasyanovych's work, but are naive to the obvious; 90% of this film are simple far and wide still shots on a tripod. Woopty-doo... some real talent needed for that I guess. Anyone can put an iPhone on a tripod and start recording, even a 5 year old. Yes, the use of machinery and sets was well used, but how hard is it to find a steel factory in a war-torn poor part of the world as your setting? Unimpressed. Even the use of heat-signature video at the start and the end is lame, amateur and pointless for a story. CAT (the construction equipment company) has a cell phone that does that. Maybe that phone was used for those shots instead of the iPhone on the tripod. Again, woopty-doo.

Then we have the 106 minutes of boring, illogical and convoluted story telling with no real beginning or end, as well as long dragged out pointless and unnecessary scenes. How was this film even classified as a sci-fi? Is the year 2025 an upcoming alien era we don't know about? I guess for those few that crave poetic art-house cinema may enjoy this, but I for one was zero entertained and very unimpressed with this one. I've seen and enjoyed many art-house films before, but they had a story, and thus I enjoyed them. I would've rather used that 106 minutes to organize my sock drawer with this sleeper. It's a very generous 3/10, all going to the cinematography - colors and use of the unique sets, and not to the laughably amateur tripod still shots."
Atlantis,97,29,critic,"
This is male cinema, in capital letters-but as written, directed, photographed, and edited by Valentyn Vasyanovych, it's also real cinema, made by an artist who has thought about why and how he's showing whatever you see.

For viewers willing to submit themselves to its somber, unhurried style, Vasyanovych's feature reveals a cruel, formidable vision.

Tonally, there are shades of Werner Herzog. But Vasyanovych's tone is distinct; not to mention timely. The crisis he depicts can be as dull as it is dramatic, making Atlantis an eerily topical watch.

Mr. Vasyanovych's approach is literally and figuratively visionary. One aspect of the vision is its treatment of machinery.

Identifying Features,100,100,audience,"Deeply powerful and emotional. A closer look at the horrors thousands of families have to go through while living in a corrupt, violent, and unsafe country, through the eyes of a desperate mother trying to find her missing son. A living proof of how far a mother's love for her child can go, representing hundreds of thousands of other mothers out there.

Fernanda Valadez just made one of 2020's best films. I'm pretty excited to see what she'll do next."
Identifying Features,100,100,audience,"When the teenage son of a middle-aged Mexican mother goes missing while en route to the US to find work, she's determined to find out what happened to him, despite official reports that he was killed by gangs roaming the country's rural highways. Her perilous odyssey proves to be quite an experience, more incredible than she ever could have imagined. Such are the makings of this chilling, sinister road trip mystery through the wilds of rural Mexico, one that literally and symbolically portrays the evil inherent in the nation's crime crisis. Although the film drags a bit in the middle and occasionally has inadequate subtitling, the picture's closing act provides quite a payoff, one that, like much of the production, is depicted with exquisite, if unsettling, cinematography. Director Fernanda Valadez's debut feature is a meticulously crafted offering that provides viewers with an inside look into a deeply worrisome problem, one that should give pause to anyone watching it -- or considering a trip through the Mexican countryside."

Herself,93,84,audience,"Having only directed three features in the last twelve years and considering those two features were the vastly different Meryl Streep vehicles Mamma Mia! and The Iron Lady, one was curious at to what Phyllida Lloyd might do with a rather straightforward drama like Herself which has no such musical aspirations or the ambition of capturing the life of an influential historical figure. It would also be Lloyd's first feature venture without Streep in the lead, but instead - this time around - Lloyd landed on a screenplay from writer/actor Clare Dunne who has starred in a handful of shorts and TV episodes, but nothing as involved or high-profile as her first crack at screenwriting alongside Malcolm Campbell. Herself, conspicuously spelled in all lower case letters on the poster as if to convey the diminutive feelings of our protagonist even in the marketing materials, is a story of a young mother in an abusive relationship, the strength and hardened determination it takes to leave that relationship only to find that overcoming one obstacle opens the floodgates to a thousand more. 

Dunne is one thousand percent the reason this otherwise flimsy film works, but its heart is obviously in the right place and Lloyd is able to strike such an endearing tone that it's nearly impossible not to be dragged into the conflict and therefore root that the characters nimbly resolve their issues in a satisfying, but almost more importantly - prosperous - fashion. As Sandra, Dunne is in nearly every frame of the film and is strapped with the responsibility and weight of not only carrying that character's burdens, but conveying the full gamut of emotions Sandra experiences; from the completeness she enjoys from spending time with her two daughters, the justifiable terror incited when her partner and the children's father enters the picture, as well as the strength she develops through a support team highlighted by the presence of Harriet Walter's Peggy. Engaging, but not wholly captivating Herself is a sturdy little drama that shines a light on the important topic of domestic violence with a nice focus on not only the strength it takes to overcome it, but to move beyond it."

Herself,93,84,audience,"Nothing SUPER special here, but a nice little film set around a woman moving on from an abusive partner."
Herself,93,84,audience,"Herself is familiar in its overall plot and it verged on overly melodramatic in certain scenes, but most of the film dealt with family abuse delicately, the approach is that of much nuance and heart while some scenes are truly devastating. The movie also benefits from a truly emotional turn from Clare Dunne who is truly outstanding here."
Herself,93,84,audience,"Honestly it is hard to say a movie this tough is awesome, but it tells the very difficult story of an abused woman (Sandra) and her struggle save herself and her daughters from her horrible ex husband.  Wonderful supporting cast including the young girls.  Yes some people are evil, but so many more people are good."
Herself,93,84,audience,the movie falls into tropes a little bit but adds small twists 
Herself,93,84,audience,"Clare Dunne plays a wife who escapes her abusive husband with her two young girls. After struggling with the social services system, she determines to build her own house. It's clear pretty quickly that determination is the byword here. Dunne's resolve, despite her desperation drives the narrative. She's surrounded by a solid supporting cast and an upbeat spirit that, despite the distressing odds, ultimately paints a portrait of a resolute, resilient woman."
Herself,93,84,audience,A bit slow at times. Really an amazing drama and very heartwarming. Well written female protagonist. It seems so rare to see capable women portrayed in Hollywood so this is refreshing.
Herself,93,84,audience,"'Herself' is one of the few films that accurately depicts PTSD when it comes to an abusive partner.  It doesn't matter if the abuse is emotional, physical, or any other abuse is still abuse.  The filmmakers are also able to illustrate just how that damage changes kids and their view of the world.  It also shows just how the government (in this case Ireland) often gets in the way of somebody trying to do the right thing.  Clare Dunne, who stars, was clearly heavily involved.  She has a 'story by' credit to go along with co-writing.  While there's a lot of lovely songs they're often way too on the nose.  This is a really good story, but perhaps focusing on the emotional abuse side would give it too much emotion.  The final act is pretty much exactly how you'd expect a PG version to end up which is disappointing considering just how powerful the first few minutes of the movie were.  Final Score: 7.5/10"

Luxor,90,40,audience,"Slow , boring and nothing really happens"
Luxor,90,40,audience,The film is a bit tedious. The main character is difficult to relate to and the story is weak. I did enjoy the views of Luxor but found the movie much too dull.
Luxor,90,40,audience,"The film follows a doctor, played by Andrea Riseborough, recuperating from working in a war zone.  She meanders around ancient Egyptian temples in Luxor, a place she is familiar with.  The writer-director Zeina Durra captures her dislocation from her current surroundings and her attempts to reconnect through the two-thousand-year history in which she is immersed.  However, despite the unique and stunning location, this is also a fairly painful process for the viewer and is ultimately unengaging and unmemorable."

My Psychedelic Love Story,89,50,audience,"To paraphrase the Grateful Dead, ""What a long strange trip it was"" (emphasis on the word ""long""). Director Errol Morris's protracted Showtime TV documentary about Joanna Harcourt-Smith, LSD guru Timothy Leary's so-called ""perfect woman,"" tells the story of their time together at the height of the psychedelic era, including their globe-trotting days on the run from authorities to evade capture for drug law violations. While some of Harcourt-Smith's stories are indeed entertaining and colorful, many of them ramble on endlessly, leaving viewers wondering if they have a point -- or a conclusion. Meanwhile, others are so outlandish that they stretch credibility and come across more like tall tales, a possibility that's not entirely improbable given Harcourt-Smith's own admission to having been a chronic liar in her youth. Ultimately, though, much of this film just isn't particularly interesting, a collection of essentially insignificant anecdotes that don't shed any revelatory light on the principals, the era in which they lived or their legacies. It seems like this material could have provided rich fodder for an engaging picture, but it instead presents little more than a name-dropping counterculture tell-all, the kind of story swapping to come out of a conclave of aging hippies."
My Psychedelic Love Story,89,50,audience,"A wild and fascinating ride into the jet set super hip lives of the high and famous.

Donbass,88,79,audience,"Stunning, unexpected, rivetting take on fake news and the absurdity of humans and war.  Brilliant and compelling."
Donbass,88,79,audience,"My second Sergey Loznitsa film and a tricky film to review. We are presented around 15 scenes or stories from Donbass - an eastern Ukranian war conflicted area. The actors are mostly amatures but they deliver, the looks of it is fine and the plot is both interesting, relevant and well written. It's labled as a drama film, but there are also plenty of dark humor here. It's got a documentary look, but it's not. All of the 15 scenes have new actors so the story is not gaining much build up - especially when it comes to characters, naturally.

The idea is great, the excecution is just all right. I never laugh but never felt bored either. It's not especially entertaining but it works just fine. A satire that easily can be looked upon with anger from some parts of the world, while other takes it much to serious or without much knowledge. I'm in that last box.

Not the easiest film to enjoy if you are not into the historical aspect of the situation. Some moments was hard to hang on to. Three or four segments where very solid so it lifts the film a whole lot for me.

6 out of 10 Snickers bars."
Donbass,88,79,audience,"Raw, brutal and painfully shattering, Donbass uniquely weaves together 10 different mini stories from all perspectives of war-torn Donbass, occupied by Russian troops. Donbass perfectly exemplifies humanity's never-ending ability to be ruthless and cruel. "
Donbass,88,79,audience,"Angry, trenchant, and savagely ironic

In an era of fake news and alternative facts, when the public's familiarity with far-flung military engagements derives as much from civilian smartphones as from on-the-front-line news reports, and where mass falsehoods promulgate like wildfire via questionable sources on social media, control of propaganda has become a key component of modern warfare. Focusing on the conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian loyalists and Russian-backed separatists, writer/director Sergei Loznitsa adopts a savagely satirical tone as he examines the corrosive effects hateful propaganda can have at all levels of society. The lack of a standard plot and the absence of a protagonist won't be to everyone's liking, whilst the dearth of geo-political contextualisation will alienate others. Nevertheless, this is sobering stuff, and as timely as it is despairing.

Donbass is made up of thirteen segments, each of which are relatively self-contained, with the only real connection between them being that each leads to the next via a particular character, who hands the narrative over (like a baton in a relay race). No character, however, appears in more than two segments. Each segment is based on a documented real-life incident that took place in the Donetsk People's Republic (a pro-Russian proto-state in the Donbass) in 2014-2015. It's worth noting, however, that having covered the origins of the War in Donbass in documentary form in Maidan (2014), Loznitsa is not especially interested here in context.

The opening segment sets the satirical tone brilliantly. Watching a group of people having makeup applied, we think we are on a film or TV set, but these people are actually being made up to appear in a ""factual"" news report as shell-shocked locals, complete with a director telling them what to say, and a stage-managed warzone in the background. It's the very definition of fake news and immediately recalls Wag the Dog (1997), in which a White House spin-doctor hires a Hollywood producer to ""produce"" a fake war.

The film's satire reaches its zenith in a scene where a man heads to a military barracks because he's been told the separatist forces have recovered his stolen jeep, only to learn they want him to sign the car over to them. When he refuses, he's hit with an exorbitant fine. Marched into another room, in a scene like something out of Douglas Adams, he finds that room full of men, all on their phones trying to raise funds to pay the fines with which they too have been hit.

Thematically, each segment has its own target, whether a sycophantic hospital administrator, a soldier abusing his power, or an uninformed mob interested only in blaming someone for their misfortunes. No one escapes censure because no one is wholly innocent. A scene with a loyalist soldier tied to a pole is especially difficult to watch, as a baying mob verbally abuse him, then begin spitting and throwing food, and, ultimately, physical assaulting him. When some of the thugs responsible attend a wedding in the following segment, they amuse themselves and the guests by showing smartphone footage of the man being beaten.

With a lack of any heroes, or even a protagonist with whom we can identify, the one tone that links the various segments is bitterness; a bitterness deeply ingrained in the souls of the people, who believe what they are being fed. Positing that the war is being fought as much with lies as with weapons, Loznitsa is suggesting that the separatist forces are criminals as much as they are combatants, and are unconcerned with Ukraine or its people, even as they position themselves as the country's saviours. 

In terms of problems, most of Loznitsa's invective is aimed at the separatists, and in this sense, the film is a little unbalanced. Another issue is the lack of political contextualisation, with no explanation of who is fighting, nor what they are fighting for. I understand what he's is trying to do here - political context is irrelevant in a conflict built on lies and absurdity - but some kind of concession to an audience not familiar with the politics would have been helpful. Another issue is that because there is no central character, there is no real emotional connection. We certainly feel sympathy with some, but there is never any real pathos.

Loznitsa doesn't see the conflict as a legitimate civil war, but instead gang warfare, with the concept of civil war used to cover-up and legitimatise criminality. In the post-truth politics of the Donbass, reality is a commodity, and its only value is in whether or not it can be sold to the masses. Of course, this situation isn't unique to Ukraine - this simulacrum of a functioning society is replicated all over the world. And for people who still value concepts such as truth, honour, and inclusiveness, this is a worrying trend. Because when truth can no longer be used as a weapon, it must be replaced with something far more powerful and far more dangerous - lies."

""The Twentieth Century"" lacks the demented, all-encompassing artistic vision of a Maddin movie... but it's a welcome diversion and Rankin's send-up of Great White North Great-Man pieties is at times inexplicably hilarious.
 "
The Twentieth Century,95,,critic,"
It is so rare these days for a wildly experimental art film to come along, it's truly one-of-a-kind and manages to be hugely funny and entertaining to boot. I would love more films to have even ten per cent of the ingenuity and imagination on display here

This Is Not a Movie,100,,audience,"Excellent portrayal of a unique journalist. Independent and undaunted by any label anyone has tried to stick on him - and there have been many from every side possible - he believes the job of the journalist is to tell the story of those who suffer injustice and to do so by understanding the history, taking the time and witnessing first-hand. His passion and strong views come across clear in this documentary as does the breadth of his work."

Unlike his previous films, director Yung Chang's admiring doc on Robert Fisk is very much a one-man show, and raises critical questions about both journalism and the fraught business of reporting on war.

The Wrong Missy,33,51,audience,"Enjoyable, goofy, funny."
The Wrong Missy,33,51,audience,"It tries to be funny, but it doesn't"
The Wrong Missy,33,51,audience,Lauren is the only reason you could watch this till the end. But it does have a cute and slightly unrealistic message at the end on how to lead life. The idea of romance shown in this film is okayish but most of the comic and romantic scenes are pedestrian making it difficult for a family viewing.
The Wrong Missy,33,51,audience,"As far as these types of movies go, it was funny, it was entertaining.  Is it Oscar worthy? No, but it was enjoyable."

The Wrong Missy,33,51,audience,"This movie was absolutely horrendous. We have to watch a guy with no spine fall in love with a no class , crazy hen and somehow pretend it's even remotely romantic. Just garbage TV and if I was any of the actors I'd be embarrassed to show my face after participating in such a film ."

The Wrong Missy is a throwaway comedy with an emasculated David Spade in a bad haircut and dye job, less than one-one-hundredth as funny as he was doing monologues on Instagram...
 "

With her idiosyncratic and energetic performance, Lauren Lapkus deserves more nuanced writing and direction than she gets in this cleverly conceived but scattershot romantic comedy.
 "
The Wrong Missy,33,51,critic,"
It's the broadest possible comedy for the lowest common denominator laughs as Lapkus falls off a cliff and bounces off jagged rocks and tree limbs. Sure, that's the Happy Madison brand ... but the O'Doyles actually died when their car plunged off a cliff.
 "
The Wrong Missy,33,51,critic,"
Some of the gags in the movie work pretty well for some genuinely funny moments ... Meanwhile, other scenes don't work at all ... The Wrong Missy ... won't be a considered a classic in the subgenre of raunchy romantic comedies.

It's a weird year for movies, obviously, but in Tyler Spindel's new Netflix Original cringe-comedy The Wrong Missy, Lauren Lapkus pulls off what might be 2020's most impressive cinematic feat: She's somehow more annoying than David Spade.

While it never achieves the status of hidden laugh riot or ignored gem, it's far from a failed experiment.

Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,audience,"Fine performances throughout a movie about Ian Dury, a punk rock legend of the 70's."
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,audience,"This is a really good music bio. docu. film about the life and times and music of Ian Dury and his band. The man's illness and disability and how he did not let it stop him from living a full life, really inspiring for me as a person with illness/disability I also don't let it stop me. Ian's childhood and his fame I liked it worth a watch if you like him his band or the 70's 80's and punk rock music and a story of a man who did not let life struggles hold him back go give it a watch."
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,audience,"An absolutely cracking performance by Serkis, and a story well told. Didn't quite have the power of Control, but a great rock biopic nonetheless"
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,audience,"Liked this movie. Good story, about real person."
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,audience,"Andy Serkis does a superb job depicting the abrupt musician Ian Dury and the many personal issues he had with life.  It's not just an ordinary biography though, there's lots of style to this film which really works in terms of both the musical influence of Dury as well as his psyche, and the director should take a lot of credit for this one too."
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,audience,"This movie is out of it's mind, but in a good way. 

The story is about a young boy, Dury nearly died after being stricken with polio. Though the ravaging disease would leave him permanently disabled, however, it would also instill him with the drive and perseverance to become one of the most influential musicians of his generation. Along with his band Ian Dury & the Blockheads, the unpredictable rocker would become a key figure in the new wave movement of the late '70s. 

Andy Serkis in this movie was pure brilliantly mad and you can see in this film that he is giving it all and I totally respect him for that, because some actors try to be over the top and try to be down right nuts, but the results are mostly Comedy and not taken seriously. The movie that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and natural born killers look to it. where in those movies they didn't care about being normal or keeping it safe, no they go full nuts and showing weird images, and this movie is no different. My only nick picks with the film was the beginning, i'm not saying it was terrible but it kind of throw me into this world of madness that was in Ian Dury's mind. Some of the characters in the film are pretty lame and forgettable. And that's it for problems, overall this movie had a good story and a fantastic performance from Andy sekis."

Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,audience,Stylish biopic. I liked the boy aspect and genereal raggedness. Serkis is more Dury than Ian himself. Or how would I have any idea?

If only the words I want to use to describe [Andy Serkis'] performance - charismatic, compelling - also applied to the movie around him.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
Even if nothing in the rest of the film quite matches that opening bravado and skill, it's a perfect opening salvo for a film that, even if it doesn't really know where it's going, has plenty of clever style while getting there.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
Whether he's being charming or wretched, Serkis delivers a 100-watt performance that perfectly matches the cheery, jagged visuals.
 "

Serkis is never less than ace.
 "

 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
The acting generally is first-class, but what holds the film together is the performance of Andy Serkis.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
Andy Serkis uncoils a performance of spit, grit and wit so ferocious it only serves to starkly clarify how unremarkable and formulaic the rest of the movie is.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
Serkis is such a live wire that the supporting actors (Olivia Williams, Naomie Harris, Ray Winstone) can do little but stand back in awe. It's the rare instance where such admiration is earned.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
Largely entertaining, but not without fault, much like Drury himself.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
Still, [Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll] has a peppy, funny and ultimately inspiring biopic with enjoyable supporting turns including Ray Winstone.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
...a major performance in a minor film.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll ticks all the music biopic boxes, but Whitecross wisely ramps things up by looking at Dury's life with the same sort of random, chaotic vision that both blessed and cursed the man himself.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
Dury may have been a colorful figure, and the film is stylishly directed, but it follows the same musical-biopic formula already used in countless other movies.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
[Serkis is} a revelation as Drury.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
Hides an utterly conventional biopic behind a narrative chopped up into flashbacks, fantasies, animated interludes, music videos and carnivalesque stage shows.
 "
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,73,66,critic,"
Somehow this well-intentioned film cannot help but turn an uncompromisingly original artist into a formula.

Justine,,78,audience,Not a bad little independent movie . The female lead was hardly tolerable for most of the movie . Which killed a lot of the movie’s goodwill for me. However by the end she sorta comes around . To me the child actors really shined . I would empty my Que or watch list first. Definitely not a must see . But you could probably do worse. 
Justine,,78,audience,"Very heartwarming film! At first I thought it was going to be very similar to Fundementals of Caregiving, but I was wrong!"
Justine,,78,audience,"Visually ugly and then utterly boring, inconclusive and unrealistic. The leading character is totally incoherent in the way she cares for the sick kid almost immediately for no apparent reason while totally not giving a damn about her two lovely kids for the whole movie. The way she gets hired for the job with no qualifications and the worst attitude ever, the liberties she takes with her employers about their kid  etc.. one thing is the suspension of belief and another is having a pile of nonsense crammed down my throat as a viewer. The woman who solely wrote and directed it should have been more humble and looked from some professional assistance from a co-writer cause she obviously lacked some objective judgement about her work. A missed opportunity."
Justine,,78,audience,"(Hopefully this makes sense.) Unfortunately, ""Justine"" did not reach my expectations. Expectations being a movie about the positive influence of someone disabled on someone having a hard time in life. All I got was a slow-paced sob film that has too many loose ends and doesn't hit the target it aimed for. The movie is littered with scenes that feel long winded, which results in scenes that could have been tearjerkers turning into flavorless mush. For example (gonna get a bit NSFW here) when Lisa sniffs her pillow and helps herself, I found that scene to be VERY unnecessary. It does nothing for her character and generally tainted Lisa's character more. The behavior of Justine's parents are barely highlighted besides that one scene. It would've been interesting to see them hear the same words they say out of Justine's mouth, it would've made for an interesting parental wake-up-call scene that would help Lisa pay more attention to her kids.  The film itself is barely even about Justine. The film mostly centers around Lisa. I know what you're thinking, 'But everyone says it's a character study!' NO. Yes, the audience needs to sympathize with Lisa due to her loss, but Justine had the potential to be a character that Lisa learned from rather than just shared joy with. Lisa's relationship with her children seemed to improve in an instant, and the movie ends quite abruptly. This movie had so much potential, but COMPLETELY missed the mark."
Justine,,78,audience,A moving story of loss and love.
Justine,,78,audience,I really enjoyed this movie on Netflix.  It is a human story told tastefully.
Justine,,78,audience,Good movie but ended very abruptly.
Justine,,78,audience,Difficult to watch but really very good
Justine,,78,audience,"Nice little independent movie. Wanted a little comeuppance for the dad, but at least mom was human."
Justine,,78,audience,"Emotional, funny and entertaining. This movie caught my attention from the trailer - although I had to convince my boyfriend to watch it. Throughout the movie we both enjoyed the story and had good laughs, but the ending could be improved. I cannot believe how the writer decided to end the movie!!! How can I move on now? What happened to Justine?? Turner, please don't do this to your future movies. I feel like I didn't get a closure for this movie!"
Justine,,78,critic,"
""Justine"" recalls the golden era of the conscientious, well-acted movie of the week: a slice of life built around hardships, but without exploiting them.
 "
Justine,,78,critic,"
The performances are just winning enough to lead us down this familiar, formulaic path, one more time.
 "
Justine,,78,critic,"
The movie is a tightly observed character study that thins out during more expositional moments, but it's still a thoughtful tale of loneliness and its remedies.

 "

It engenders great respect for the artists, and a desire not only to seek out and revisit the songs it features but also to go beyond the film's selections and uncover the rest of what doo-wop had to offer.

Crip Camp,100,93,audience,"Crip Camp has an interesting story but it’s told in a pretty bland way. The story is definitely an important one and an interesting one. The footage they showed was mostly engaging. But I didn’t care for how the film was told. It’s just people talking and old footage. It feels like they didn’t try enough to make it cinematically engaging and just leaned too much on the story. Still, the story mostly carries it to make it interesting. Overall, I liked this. This isn’t one of the most innovative documentaries out there, but for what it was I liked it. "
Crip Camp,100,93,audience,Moving and inspiring to say the least!
Crip Camp,100,93,audience,"Beginning in the early 1950s, Camp Jened, in upstate New York, was a place where teenagers with disabilities could go and experience, many for the first time, a place where they could be teenagers and live freely with people like them with disabilities. In the late '60s and early '70s, the camp was run by hippies, so there were a lot of freedoms provided that the kids did not get elsewhere. Many of these summer campers ended up migrating to the Center for Independent Living in Berkeley, an innovative center focused on providing services to the disabled. It was here that the movement for passage of the Rehabilitation Act (particularly Section 504) and the Americans with Disabilities act began.  This is a wonderful film that details the path toward the passage of Section 504 and the ADA Act. Fortunately for us, a local theater troupe spent significant time filming the kids; there is a lot of archival footage that is just such a joy to watch – they are being kids, they are funny, and they all talk about being in a place that values them for who they are. The way many of these kids, later as adults, and with the support of many organizations, mobilized to create change is inspiring. Several of those kids are still alive today, and the film contains a lot of interview footage as these older adults look back on their times in the movement and in Camp Jened. Huge thumbs up from me! I absolutely loved this film that is an important and poignant slice of history; it is a film everyone should see. It is amazing to me that, with all of the footage and the people who are still alive today, that this movie was only made this year. I learned an incredible amount of history and about the profound impact these people have had on disability rights."
Crip Camp,100,93,audience,it was actually pretty damn good there was some kind of problems with it but I won't name here but it was an amazing movie and I would love to give another re-watch and do this is going to be a watch every year kind of movie
Crip Camp,100,93,audience,"Loved the way this doc unfolded, this was surprisingly compelling as ""characters"" developed along the way. Now I have a deeper understanding of the ADA and 504s and I'm proud to admit that fact!"

Crip Camp,100,93,audience,a great documentary about the ADA and how it changed the lives of so many people and the way this country works
Crip Camp,100,93,audience,Such a great movie. You see the perspective of disabled people in America and how they fought for their rights. It also gives you perspective into how much the camp meant to them and the affect it had on their lives.

It's the greatest underdog story ever told, by America's greatest underdogs: people with disabilities. It puts ""Rudy"" to severe shame."

I'm so grateful that all this footage was saved... being able to see the evolution from the early days to what this movement became.. it's just a really beautiful story.

While Crip Camp is not a perfect effort, its honesty about its participants and their world gives it an undeniable potency right to the last moment.

At times it feels like Crip Camp bites off slightly too much for a movie that's less than two hours long. But I can't really blame the directors for cramming in as much information as they can.

Crip Camp,100,93,critic,"
The title of Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution is somewhat misleading because the movie is more about the 'revolution' than it is about the 'camp.' The movie itself is an inspiring but unevenly edited documentary.

An inspiring film to open your mind and learn about an historic movement. [Full review in Spanish]

Crip Camp,100,93,critic,"
The film uses the word ""crip"" and reclaims it. By doing so, a pejorative is thus transformed into a badge, maybe of honor, certainly of power.

Blow the Man Down,98,74,audience,"Murder mysteries are one of my favorite genres and I found this film a pleasantly quirky surprise. Starting with a crusty fishermen greek chorus singing a sea shanty of the film's title, I was instantly lure in. I vacationed in Maine for two weeks one idyllic summer but this film takes place in the dead of winter where the residents of the small fishing village of Easter Cove are just holding on with the prospect of warmer weather and better times. The death of the Connolly sisters' mother, Mary Margaret, leaves the young women burdened with a nearly foreclosed home, a failing fish market, and hopes for a fulfilling future bleak. With the prospect of attending the University of Maine dimming, Mary Beth Connolly spends her nights at the local bar hitting on ""creeps."" One of these encounters goes terribly wrong and she enlists her sister, Pris, to help her cover up the crime. These two very different sisters embark on a journey into the underside of their hometown and discover that everyone holds secrets even the village grey-haired busybodies that Enid, the local brothel's madam mockingly calls, ""hens."" The film, running at a tight 90 minutes, is darkly funny taking advantage of down eastern quaint accented ways. The movie reminded me of the Coen Brothers' ""Fargo"" but with a definitely welcomed lighter feminine touch. See it and enjoy!"
Blow the Man Down,98,74,audience,This movie looked better on the trailer but still entertaining. Different. Original. Slow at times but keeps you guessing 7/10
Blow the Man Down,98,74,audience,Intuitiva. Curiosa. Conflictiva. No esperaba la historia que encontre (Vistas 1)
Blow the Man Down,98,74,audience,I turned it off at 21:33. Maybe it's a comedy after that but definitely not before. Dark and bloody is more like it. Not that I don't mind a little dark humor but it wasn't in the least bit funny. Just awful!
Blow the Man Down,98,74,audience,"Has a kind of Knives Out vibe, a murder mystery with a low key sensibility. You won't regret watching it."
Blow the Man Down,98,74,audience,"Too slow, not enough “mystery”"
Blow the Man Down,98,74,audience,Not sure I understood this film. Seemed like mostly undertow and currents. Subtleties and suggestion. Female-power or feminism backdrop? I did like the different accents that did not feel the need for explanation. I enjoyed it but am confused. Is it a new definition of a film type?  Acting was good. I felt a little unresolved at the end. Made me feel a bit shallow for not grasping the concept.  Sea shanties on the radio today too! 6.2/0. D.B.
Blow the Man Down,98,74,audience,A clever film that takes chances and does many unexpected things. The performances are good and it delivers twists that I didn't see coming.
Blow the Man Down,98,74,audience,"Great low budget film, filmed in beautiful Maine."
Blow the Man Down,98,74,audience,"It’s tonally all over the place, and is a little too slow going in getting started, but this is a neat little picture that survives being just another Fargo clone by the performances, east coast twang and another transcendent performance from Margo Martindale. "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
Their roughly 90-minute-film feels both personal - they say the characters 'were inspired by our moms, aunts, grandmothers and matriarchs' in their lives - and a bit unpolished.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
A tightening of the screws would have helped this thriller immensely. But Cole and Krudy are after something a little different here than just two sister and one downward spiral.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
It's normally not a great sign when the lead characters are less compelling than anything around them, but the Connollys' predicament opens up the weird bits of village mythology and feminine conspiracy that secretly drives the film forward.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
The performances are solid, the writing sublime, the cinematography rich - come for the murder, stay for the drah-ma.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
Blow the Man Down is a mystery-thriller with a quiet case of genre-confusion. It is a dark comedy at times, a family drama at others and a satirical mystery in its finest moments.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
[A] murder movie with momentum...
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
The movie benefits greatly from its location shooting, the veteran cast that includes Margo Martindale, Annette O'Toole and June Squibb and tight construction.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
It's a clever movie whose characterful and low-key suspense pleasures are like the screen equivalent of a new book by Kate Atkinson or Louise Penny.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
Blow the Man Down is swift but not choppy, with Martindale silencing people merely by appearing in doorways
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
Blow the Man Down is a rather unique beast of a film.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
The movie feels like a slow-motion skid on thin ice, as an atmosphere of dread slowly envelops the characters.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
While the script has plenty of nifty twists and macabre turns, plus a supremely satisfying wrap-up, the film's visual language is distressingly mundane, and the editing makes some of the otherwise fine performances seem a bit flabby.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
Blow the Man Down has the benefit of a talented cast that adds layers of depth to a script that isn't particularly original.
 "
Blow the Man Down,98,74,critic,"
There's just enough surprise, shock, and interest involved here to keep you guessing, and the cast takes care of the rest. Margo Martindale proves why she's one of the best.

Steeped in atmosphere and a wonderfully textured sense of place.

Noir maritime atmosphere is in abundant supply here, helped along by the jarring violin drones of the score - although Blow the Man Down sometimes struggles to find the balance between crime caper and noir mystery

Human Nature,97,76,audience,"Human Nature is a documentary film which is an in-depth description of the gene editing process of CRISPR, and its possible implications.  If you're a science nerd or love docs, this is for you.  If you're a brainiac, here's a film up your alley.  If Dukes of Hazard is intellectual TV, then you probably wanna pass on this.  And oh yea, we're presented with some pretty horrific possibilities and some that are the opposite.  It should in the very least make you think.  Final Score: 7.8/10"
Human Nature,97,76,audience,"The subject matter is fascinating, some of the experts interviewed were clearly outstanding in their field, but sadly the producers of this documentary decided it was far more important to focus on cinematic photography and stylistic, slow-paced ambience and music. The pace of this film is maddeningly slow, and it assumes that the average person does not have sufficient intelligence to keep up with an appropriate pace of information. If someone were to re-edit this film and simply take out all of the b-roll of macro shots and dead air space, this would be a gripping documentary."
Human Nature,97,76,audience,Great film to learn about how genes can be edited for the betterment of human health.
Human Nature,97,76,audience,A well-presented documentary that is incredibly fascinating and thought-provoking. Human Nature acknowledges the pros and cons its ground-breaking Scientific discovery could be capable of in the right and wrong hands. The film's subjects explain the specifics in a broadly accessible manner with great clarity. A must-see for anyone who values and enjoys self-education.
Human Nature,97,76,audience,"It does not only give you information about the much coveted CRISPR but also gives the viewers a chance to think about it. Which eventually leads t the question of our existence and how we came here. 
Very well made. Great visuals."
Human Nature,97,76,audience,"Insightful documentary, highly recommend it."
Human Nature,97,76,audience,Nice ideas in a mostly uninteresting package.

Human Nature is entertaining as well as highly informative, and you might be shocked to find yourself leaving the theater more hopeful than you came in.
 "

Human Nature excels if you want to know the details about what goes on in the science labs ... However, the movie falls short if you're the type of person who wants to know how this research is going to apply to the real world.

Capably elucidates, in quite accessible terms, one of the most important threads in contemporary microbiology while explaining both the promise and the danger it poses.
 "
Human Nature,97,76,critic,"
It is so gratifying and exciting when a documentary filmmaker takes a complex scientific subject and transforms it into an accessible and engaging presentation. That's exactly what director Adam Bolt does.
 "
Human Nature,97,76,critic,"
Do we embrace a discovery wielding the promise of curing and preventing cancers and birth defects, or shun it for its ability to rob us of our unique individuality? It's a compelling argument.

...the equivalent of [a] popular science book, presenting basic knowledge in an attractive package that not only holds the viewer's attention, but helps that knowledge to stick.

""Human Nature"" gives audiences a personal stake in the subject before delving into some pretty serious science, all of which has been thoughtfully organized into an easy-to-follow logical flow.
 "

Neatly put together, accessible and smart, Human Nature spends only a small portion of its running time mired in the usual debates, getting beyond them to explore much more interesting areas.

Every ""Oh wow"" in ""Human Nature"" is matched by an ""Oh no"" somewhere down the line. Together, these two competing emotions - excitement and unease - make for one pretty fascinating documentary.
 "
Human Nature,97,76,critic,"
Far and away the most intelligent, thought-provoking movie of the young year... See it and be amazed.
 "
Human Nature,97,76,critic,"
A lively and engrossing genetics documentary filled with experts, highly-educated people who give many sides of a serious scientific issue without the shouting shallowness of cable TV weighing in.
 "
Human Nature,97,76,critic,"
A compelling documentary that asks us to question the essence of what it means to be human.
 "
Human Nature,97,76,critic,"
The film is at its most intriguing in its earlier half, when it simply takes you through the growing excitement within the scientific community as the reality of CRISPR emerges.
 "
Human Nature,97,76,critic,"
Bolt is good at keeping the science at a level that is clear and concise. His subjects include a wide range of scientists and bio-engineers working on the front-line of what might be possible, and fully aware of the concerns they must address.

Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
...original and accomplished.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
Through the use of family letters, photographs and government records, Heise attempts to piece together what remains of his family... The film serves as a sort of testimony of the [Germany]'s history, as well as, that of Heise's family.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
I would absolutely recommend seeing Heimat Is A Space In Time in a movie theater, where the visuals will hypnotize you, along with Heise's voice.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
What begins as an entrancing experience becomes increasingly exhausting.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
Despite some tedious passages, ""Heimat Is a Space in Time"" takes an intriguing approach to history that remains refreshingly rooted in primary sources.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
But although it is at times distractingly opaque, occasionally Heise's family's words, juxtaposed with his sounds and images, crystallize into something singularly wise about the nexus of place, history and trauma.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
Thomas Heise's documentary seeks to excavate real human thought and feeling beneath the haze of larger political structures.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
It is both aesthetically daring and narratively riveting, and the film maintains this feeling for the nearly three hours that follow.
 "

There is something to get lost in that drift that physically and sensory transports us on this trip. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
Out of great specificity come universal truths, and Heimat Is a Space in Time is as specific as it needs to be to be universally true.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
Yet the overall effect of Heise's work is mesmeric, persuasive and cumulatively powerful, as each piece of the puzzle falls into place and he lands on overarching insights into a German century and what it portends for the future.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
It's the seemingly insignificant details that should be meaningful to their family alone that really blow this thing wide open because they inevitably represent so much more.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
So, it remains up to the viewer to measure the continuance of the past while the actual family history - who died; who married who - becomes as riveting as a half-grasped soap opera, with lives and loves disappearing in the fog of time.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
In some respects, Heimat Is a Space in Time is the film that Heise was always leading up to.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
German filmmaker Thomas Heise delves into his family's (and country's) tortured past in this transfixing documentary.
 "
Heimat is a Space in Time,100,,critic,"
It wants viewers to engage with it and think about its anti-nostalgic, scrapbook construction, and Heise accomplishes his ambitious goals with ease and grace.

Bloodshot,30,78,audience,"I have a conflict with Bloodshot, at no time do I connect with any character and the visual effects are very disappointing, Vin Diesel does not reach his peak as an actor and his character becomes very boring, and the serious tone that the film tries to take he completely collapses when he sees how badly made the movie is."
Bloodshot,30,78,audience,wow!! vin diesel is shining again on the white canvas! I for one would certainly recommend this movie . Get your favorite snacks and drinks together you're gonna want to watch this
Bloodshot,30,78,audience,"Horribly done. The story while decently adapted from the comic just seemed rehashed on the big screen from so many other movies. The acting was subar. The graphics were horrible and the fight scene just looked like actors recorded themselves on the toilet and had it dropped into the cgi fight scenes,"
Bloodshot,30,78,audience,"Bloodshot is a popcorn movie that is definitely entertaining. It's a shame because Diesel is put into a terribly written film that could have been so much more. However, it does have some solid Vin Diesel action sequences that will push viewers to keep watching no matter how cliche the story is.

Bloodshot,30,78,audience,Great entertainment.
Bloodshot,30,78,audience,A little messy and chased
Bloodshot,30,78,audience,Nothing special but sometimes kinda interesting.
Bloodshot,30,78,audience,"The character development is ridiculously thin, but the concept is fun."
Bloodshot,30,78,audience,"It's definitely a movie for fans of Vin Diesel, but the story telling lacks in organization though you can still understand what's going on. But with the end result I would definitely ask for a bit more."
Bloodshot,30,78,audience,Forty minutes in. A terrible and predictable intro jumps into bad acting and unconvincing (super cheesy) one-liners. No chemistry or convincing interaction between anyone. Not sure I can handle any more of this. I see a star in the sky that looks more interesting. I think I'll look at it for the next hour and walk away more impressed. One star is not for the movie. It is for my new friend in the sky.
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
Never trying to break free from the comic book action movies of old, Bloodshot is a throwback to the time where the best versions of familiar tropes laid atop a remixed story make for a blast of a night at the movies.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
Yet another attempt to start a new cinematic universe, this feels like a comic book movie from at least ten years ago, and even the stoic charisma of Vin Diesel can't save it.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
A hot piece of garbage that won't be remembered!
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
So, while it may be faint praise to say Bloodshot is occasionally quite fun, that is very much the case.

Vin Diesel's Valiant Comics superhero can't transcend the Marvel-DC bipartisanship.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
A rudimentary film that has trouble differentiating itself from others of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
As the center of the story and as the titular superhero, [Vin] Diesel's acting is almost as artificially lifeless as Ray Garrison/Bloodshot.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
You may not need a past to have a future, but you need a movie with some life to create a good time in a theater. This film is just a bad idea gone wrong.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
Bloodshot is a pretty true to form adaption from the Valiant comic book story, save for the apparent Hollywood ego preventing the actual character from be fully depicted.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
It's just a pity that it all feels like a seen-it-all-before bionic spin-off that doesn't have the confidence to morph into its own uniquely regenerated creation.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
Strictly boilerplate.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
A terrific, unusual action pic. Even those cold on Vin should enjoy it...It's one of the niftiest non-Fast and Furious action films he's made.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
Bloodshot is an action packed movie, but also predictable, slow, and very familiar. What had such great potential falls flat time and time again.
 "

You're the one that will need resurrection...after watching Bloodshot.

Vin Diesel has charisma to spare in his new turn as an action hero, and you either love him or hate him for it. [Full review un Spanish]
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
A dead-on-arrival of the first movie in a proposed shared cinematic universe based on Valiant Comics.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
A delightfully dumb-dumb pastiche. Call it The Vinter Soldier or 50 First Diesels or Mevinto. Its closest analogue is Venom - call it Vinom! - a mingling of mid-'90s superheroics with a new-millennium budget.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
Like a forgotten '90's action classic released into our homes in a time of great need, ""Bloodshot"" provides everything you expected and nothing more.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
The 'big reveal' ... isn't.
 "
Bloodshot,30,78,critic,"
The Hollywood pitch for Bloodshot must have been something like, ""It's Iron Man meets RoboCop by way of Wolverine."" Which actually kind of works as it combines some of the best aspects of these solo characters.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,audience,"A powerful humanitarian statement, great acting, suspenseful from start to finish, a slow burner conceived by the genius brothers. A timely and accurate portrait of fanaticism and an essential representation of compassion and forgiveness."
Young Ahmed,60,56,audience,"Between 2.5 and 3 stars. Made in a documentary-like style, you will understand and at the same time hate this stubborn boy how he spoils his life."
Young Ahmed,60,56,audience,Propaganda at its finest
Young Ahmed,60,56,audience,"Debated if should've given it just the 3.5 stars (Recommend).  But... I don't like movies that leave me hanging in the end, having to guess what could've, or would've.  It's all about this ""radicalized"" and ""brain-washed"" Ahmed about being a Muslim.  We just scratched our head as to how this boy got so brain-washed so early (young).  In the end, he felt from the roof, and was like dying, and his mother appears, the ""perhaps"" he realized his mother was the best?  We don't know if he was going to reject his muslimness because of this fall, which likely woke up his brain?"
Young Ahmed,60,56,audience,What saves this boring screenplay is the direction and the acting of the main characters. But it's still not worth it to watch.
Young Ahmed,60,56,audience,"Young Ahmed starts off very promising. The coming-of-age story of a fundamentalist Muslim that is willing to take up violence against non-believers in a European country hits a lot of interest points and relevance. The movie had the promise to dig deeper, making political and human points and add a strong character arc to a young child. This movie, unfortunately, due to the ending of the film, left a lot to be desired. The final plot wasn't believable and somewhere along the way, I kind of lost interest."
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
What will Ahmed do in the end? This question remains up in the air until literally the final seconds of the film. This makes for a compelling story. The actors are all very convincing.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
Without meaning to, the filmmakers, mired in immediacy and discouraged by the general course of events, end up largely blaming their characters for their own conditions.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
The directors' aesthetics are as formally rigorous and evocative as ever, capturing the unyielding nature of zealotry, as well as the difficulty of loosening extremism's terrible grip on individuals' hearts and minds.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
[Filmmakers Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne] are clear-sighted and righteous in their approach.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
ranks with the Dardennes's best films in terms of aligning us with a protagonist whose actions and worldview we may vigorously oppose, but with whom can't help empathizing
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
What remains is a story of rehabilitation, well-directed and acted, but a missed opportunity all the same.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
The narrative unfolds in that earnest semi-documentary (and French language) style that the Dardennes do so well. But it's also glib and unconvincing, and topped off by a profoundly stupid ending.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
As counsellors try to rehabilitate Ahmed, his impassiveness becomes the film's subject, and there's not much to be said about it.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
It's a coming-of-age story with a difference and well worth seeing.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
The audience is left to find sparse clues in a story that feels less ambiguous but more underdeveloped.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
Young Ahmed might be major filmmakers in a minor mode, but it is still a riveting, beautifully made character study that provokes compassion and controversy in equal measures.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
Young Ahmed can't resist the odd moment of melodrama, which sometimes feels out of place in an otherwise undiluted piece of social realism. This might not be vintage Dardennes, but it is still one of their most daring works to date.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
The Dardennes have often put the young at the heart of their deceptively simple stories. Here they do it as urgently as ever - Ahmed a source of mounting dread, but still a boy, as yet undamned.
 "
Young Ahmed,60,56,critic,"
Ahmed poses many difficult questions-about the nature of evil, rehabilitation, and the limits of empathy-that it leaves the audience to answer.

Sorry We Missed You,88,81,audience,"A film that struck me to my very core. Amazingly real portrayal of working-class Britain and of the social and emotional toll modern working conditions take on people's lives. 
But this time something is different. In previous Ken Loach films, like The Navigators, eventually, the workers get together and react to the harsh change of their working conditions. But in Sorry We Missed You, Loach portrays the utter despair that leads people in recent years to accept dehumanizing working conditions because they feel trapped and that they have no choice, without leaving room for a ray of light. The protagonists are too strung out, too physically and emotionally exhausted to seek out or even think of a different way of work or life. It is a cruel irony that in Sorry We Missed You, Ricky willingly approaches the transport company to work for them, in an effort to ""start his own business"".
But maybe it is not the director himself that losing his optimism; it is that the reaction of the average worker would be different today than a decade or two ago. And that I think is what Loach is trying to capture; the contemporary average worker. By making him a protagonist, he idolizes him and makes him a symbol of any modern worker. And it is a positive thing that symbols do not need to be going toward this or that direction to be considered as such. Ricky, the film's protagonist, is not a symbol because he fought against the cruel conditions imposed upon him – he didn't. He is not a symbol because he was charismatic, because he brought his comrades together to negotiate with Maloney and achieve better working conditions – not even Ricky's close friend who first told him about the company was there for him in any of his misfortunes. 
This is a recurring theme in this Loach film: isolation. There are no scenes where friends help friends out. There is only Rick's family – and even that was beginning to disintegrate by the end of the film. Both parents working 12- and 14-hour shifts, no grandparents or other family to help, and two kids stranded, one is stuck with the role of the responsible adult - and collapsing when it all becomes too much to handle - and the other assuming the role of the troubled teen. And there is the isolation that Ricky himself feels, eventually even from his own family; his son who loves him, his daughter who tries to get him to stop working at that awful company, and his wife who shies away when he eventually becomes violent towards his son.
The film's portrayal of a working-class family trying to make ends meet and the toll it takes on all its members is agonizing yet brilliant. Nothing short of yet another Ken Loach masterpiece."
Sorry We Missed You,88,81,audience,This heart felt movie made me be thankful for my life again. It was way too full of unfortunate events however nothing impossible. Acting was on point and the family bonds were perfectly portraited.
Sorry We Missed You,88,81,audience,"While the actors performed their roles quite well, the script was tedious.  After the first hour, the message of modern capitalism setting workers onto ever faster treadmills with no hope of betterment was clear.  But the piling of one family calamity upon another was relentless and the characters were not allowed to show any development or hope of eventual development whatsoever. There were no friends, no family, no resources, no mercy. Not even a brief interlude of respite from misery. Perhaps if they had been depicted a few years earlier when things were not so dire and THEN falling into the pit of despair, a better sense could have been conveyed of the process by which families spiral out of control.  While happier times were occasionally alluded to, their plight was dire at the beginning and remained so for the entirety of the film."
Sorry We Missed You,88,81,audience,This movie will make you leave a 5 star rating for the delivery of your packages for the rest of your life.
Sorry We Missed You,88,81,audience,"I've previously defended Loach as a 'purveyor of misery porn', but this is too much. Yes, the dialogue is generally excellent; as is the acting. Fron Hitchen to Honeywood, Stone to Brewster (an ex-cop making his acting debut), the performances save this script of wretched circumstances from drowning the viewer in nothing more than the suffering of good people due to circumstances out of their control. 
But the agonizing litany of undeserved misfortunes, Rickey and Abby have a trust in others based on their own simple goodness. It is just inconceivable to then that the world could be so harsh, but they know it is at the same time. 
The ""gig economy"" increasingly asks more from low-end workers as it gives them less in return. I get that Seb may just be meant to symbolize the extreme results that such miserable situations do indeed bring on, but he's also at a base level an ungrateful little shit that needed a boot up his arse; or maybe a week on the street. 
Great artistry by a great filmmaker, fine screenwriter, strong actors meets misery porn, I will admit to an extent. 3.2 stars, still."

Sorry We Missed You,88,81,audience,This is just not my movie I guess. It's so depressing and it kinda gets boring. I don't care about any of these characters. They live messed up lives and they messed up. I know I'm supposed to feel bad but that their decision and it eventually leads to nothing. The ending felt abrupt and the pay off is nothing. It's a sad movie yes but man I'm done with these random movies that I'll forget about in a couple of hours.

Sorry We Missed You,88,81,audience,"""Sorry we missed you"" is a humanist enthralling movie, an opened window on the low-class, working poor England. It brings to the viewer a brand new, different vision towards low-class people. The movie denounces hard working conditions, and above all our consumer society that neglects people for the benefit of capitalism, an inhuman economic system simply based on profit and performance. Even if it means losing one's life. 

This brilliant realistic drama takes us to Newcastle in North England where Ricky, Abby and their two children Sebastian and Lisa live. There, every day is a struggle against poverty. Indeed, Abby works hard in the homes of the elderly. On the other hand, Ricky is a self-employed worker; he delivers packages. But the reality is very different. Actually, the delivery company exploits their workers and watches over them. Because of their jobs, the parents have no time for their children. For example, Abby has to call her children to tell them where their meal is. With the children left to their own devices Sebastian, the young teenager, rebels by committing more and more offences. Therefore, every time the sun rises, the poison of society consumes the family a little more. 

However, even though the end of the film seems unfinished, this could be interpreted more subtly. According to me, it may have been decided to be unfinished as the solving of the family's endless list of problems that never seem to be solved. In conclusion, this Ken Loach's movie makes as usual the viewer aware of the reality of life."

The Banker,79,100,audience,Great story well executed by the actors. Awesome movie to watch
The Banker,79,100,audience,"You become emotionally invested in the struggle, holding out for prevailment and a sense of justice. It's delivered to you in an unexpected way, touching on different layers of social injustice, at times even among the characters we are rooting for. But there is something slightly under-baked about these characters, expressed one-dimensionally, and largely compensated by the craft of actors like Samuel L. Jackson. A greater depth and contextuality for these characters would have paid off, which could have elevated a good film to great one."
The Banker,79,100,audience,I will clump this together with the Founder and Hidden Figures as the genre of feel good biography's with enough heavy moments to balance with the light ones.

Greed,48,33,audience,"Funny, classy and great fun to watch"
Greed,48,33,audience,"Greed doesn't work. It's neither funny nor serious enough, and while it's well put together (up to a point), structurally it's all over the place. Its subject and target is a flamboyant and appalling store owner, very obviously modelled on asset-stripper Philip Green. Steve Coogan has the tan and the peroxide teeth and he's throwing a ghastly 60th birthday bash on Mykonos. That on its own could have been enough, but writer-director Michael Winterbottom unfortunately pours refugees, reality TV, garment workers, family dysfunction, and even a coke-addled lion into the mix, and the result is indigestion."
Greed,48,33,audience,"It started off well and interesting but dragged terribly in the second half, and why he was considered a bad guy was never really justified."
Greed,48,33,audience,"Not even loosely based on the life and times of Philip Green this is one mess of a film. It's never quite sure whether it's a comedy, a morality tale or a tragedy and ends up being none of them. A saving grace might be that it's an easy way to waste 90 minutes. It's not even that. We only watched it to the end to see how bad it could get. A waste of Steve Coogan and David Mitchell's talent. Suspect Coogan was relieved to be eaten by the lion. I know I was."
Greed,48,33,audience,Your review will help others decide whether to watch.
Greed,48,33,audience,"Apart from being well-done in terms of acting, story and film-making, this is a very important movie.  It does an excellent job of describing the bizarre and obscene inequalities in the world which are encouraged, supported and used by the greedy and our economic systems - not just in the fashion industry."
Greed,48,33,audience,Don't why but I like the film while everyone else don't like it lol
Greed,48,33,audience,"I'm not sure what Greed was trying to achieve... it's part black comedy, part moral tale, part mockumentary. In the end it's a pastiche of all 3. It has its moments and Coogan carries his leading role well, but ultimately it swallows itself way before it has time to finish. It then craps out the usual anti-capitalist, exploitation, men are shit, women do all the graft and everything should be fair and equal narrative that we love to sprinkle on our over priced lattes before firing up our laptops,  taking calls on our iPhones and rubbing our feet together in our Nikes. Go figure."
Greed,48,33,audience,A clever parody of the High Street and popular culture whilst including references to ancient culture.  Really enjoyed it - definitely worth watching!
Greed,48,33,audience,"I watched this twice today having missed about 20 minutes of it on the first viewing.
So much meaningful content that I felt I needed to see what else I had missed.
A damning portrait of the dodgy money making practices of the uber rich.
I loved the references to Greek tragedies  and how  hubris really did play a role in the  bloody downfall of this greed ridden entrepreneur. Some clever ""in"" jokes for anyone  who knows their Greek tragedies and a bit of Shakespeare.
Lots of bits to laugh at and about as well, after all this is starring Steve Coogan and David Mitchell.
The contrast between the life of the main character and those he exploits to  make his clothing is huge and the final come uppance serves a number of  purposes.
The ""postcard"" comments  in the last few minutes are a real way of grounding this film in the reality of the lives of those who make the clothes we wear."

This is a Coogan and Winterbottom collaboration, so it's not without comic merit, but this feels like a missed opportunity to fire a shot into the heart of the very real problem of the super-rich.

We knew from the title that we'd be confronting one of the deadly sins; we just didn't know we'd still be doing penance as the credits rolled.
 "

An ""eat the rich"" comedy and a docudrama about the fast fashion industry is a lot to cram into one movie, and you can't help but feel that Michael Winterbottom might have found a better vehicle to express his anger (but give it credit for trying).

We should feel complicit in this mess, but Winterbottom shields us from all culpability by nailing McCreadie to the cross of popular resentment.

Yet, the film is not capable of adequately capturing the rapid socio-political changes and how such changes have derailed the fate and impacted existential conditions of most Chinese, if it is director Jia Zhangkeâ(TM)s intention. While Jia was commissioned by Shanghai authorities to produce this documentary, I trust that he was not compromising his conscience in art for the purpose of publicising the 2010 expo. 
It is exciting to see the people including some who have become of the history shared their affection and first-hand experience in those turbulent days and troubled times. No matter how solid their background was and how much they loved the country, he or she had inevitably drowned in the mighty current of the times, and suffered. I Wish I Knew is a documentary slightly âdramatizedâ? by whom it had interviewed, making it an alternative to Jiaâ(TM)s other simple and unadorned films for the ordinary people. Hope this forms a good transition for Jia in moving forward to subject matters and genres he is concerned most."

I Wish I Knew,100,,audience,"The world's greatest cinematic observer of change has crafted another exceptional film focusing on the city of Shanghai.  Zhang Ke has several people interviewed who have all lived or experienced Shanghai in some capacity. They tell about growing up in a city caught up in turmoil - particularly in 1949.  Their stories are personal, historic, political and all truly interesting.  In between interviews, the beautiful actress Zhao Tao wanders through the city.  Rarely has a city been shown so beautifully rendered as it has with this film.  And all the interviews are shot with such meticulous attention to detail.  There is a particular incredible homage to Hou Hsaio-hsien's film Dust in the Wind just prior to interviewing the director himself.  I Wish I Knew chronicles the history of a city with nostalgia, harsh memories and captures on film how much the city continues to change - physically and socially.  A tremendous effort by the outstanding Chinese filmmaker."
I Wish I Knew,100,,audience,"Zhang-Ke Jia's new feature documentary. I'm not perfectly sure, but I heard it's made for the Shanghai World Expo 2010. There must be a lot of financial support from the Chinese government, and I was afraid that even Jia was finding himself adjustment to political situation of China today before I watched, but it turned out to be not as I worried. He's surely clever - with probably the most budget that he'd ever got, he used that money to train himself as a film director - using quotations from new and old Chinese films from all over Chinese areas (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), he does not only give them homage but also even play with them by mimic of some particular shots from works by Kar-Wai Wang, Hsiao-Hsien Hou, Ye Lou etc. It was also efficient and clever way to show how China has changed (or remained same) from when those films were made. He also completes the way he examined in his last film ""24 City."" However, because he does not focus only on Shanghai (jumping to Hong Kong or Taiwan suddenly), it distracts me strongly from what the film should have had to be main-focused. Some fictional parts (starring Zhao Tao and Giong Lim) do not work well either. I'm not yet sure how this film will find its own place in Jia's filmography later when he'll become one of world's masters - at least for now, I don't see the point for Jia to make this film..."

Review: Emma
The film that I will be reviewing is Emma. It was directed by Autumn De Wilde and was released on February the 14th 2020. As a drama and Victorian-era lover I enjoyed the ongoing gossip of women with beautiful garments and marvelous palaces that were being displayed in the movie. The acting was beyond perfection and the cast was inexorably pretty as I do say so myself. I wish there was a continuation of the movie so I could go watch the second one.
 
Emma woodhouse, a girl born in to a wealthy household with a father as a widower is becoming a Victorian-era matchmaker for Harriet smith who became her protégé. At first she told her to turn down a marriage proposal Harriet got from a farmer called Dr. Martin. But her interference doesn't stop there. This occasion ends with a bad note and Emma swears to never matchmake again. Emma wanted to match Harriet with Mister Elton. But that ended badly and took a turn. A few moments later a ball has been organised and the little girl Harriet needs a partner. After being refused by sir Elton, mister Knightley, a good friend of the Woodhouse family takes Harriet as his dance partner and saves her from humiliation. After that day a picknick is organised and Emma makes a shocking remark to the defenceless spinster miss Baine. In that moment she realises that she has underlying feelings for the respected sir Knightley. At the end of the story the lovely characters get married and even Harriet gets her own lover. As a reviewer and smart intelligent student that I am. I, myself have some opinions that I'd like to address. I find the movie monotonous, that means that I'd liked it even more if there was a bit more action. Because there is nothing really outrageous happening. Other then love problems and family drama. The women and men show us how love and hatred can be so easy made in the world. For example, Emma gets immediately jealous when Harriet gets a dance from sir Knightley. People can be vulgar and mean in this kind of situation as to why I refer to the allegory of the city of the blind. By vulgar I mean it in a figurative meaning that people will do anything to get what and whom they want.
 
The movie has good potential and could be one of the most interesting story that could be told. Personally it could be much shorter because it's to long and the watcher could easily lose interest. My general view on the movie is that it was outstandingly played and very interesting."

Emma  (Jane Austen) 2020

Emma is a dazzling costume film that balances its relationship between romance and comedy. That's what also attracted me to definitely give it a shot and check it out after watching the trailer. The film was released in 2020 by Autumn de Wilde. Many years later after the novel was published, namely in 1816 by Jane Austen. As someone who likes to watch comedy films I can say that Emma also had the expected ending as most movies but is worth watching.

Emma Woodhouse is a young lady brought to life by Anya Taylor-Joy. She fits the role perfectly. A young, smart and wealthy young lady who enjoys connecting people. She always tries to pair her friend Miss Taylor with someone. After she got married she couldn't do that anymore and had to find someone else to do it in her place. Later she finds someone, a seventeen-year-old girl named Harriet, she tries to match her with someone else, but that is not as easy as she thinks. 

Johnny Flynn, who brings the role of George Knightley to life with finesse, gives a professional acting job. The film reminds me of another one called P.S. I still love you. That is a second part of the first book To all the boys I loved before  because Lara Jean (protagonist in the book) also has difficulties and hasistations to find her perfect match not in the beginning but towards the end.

Besides the story, the format of the film is very good. The costumes, environment and graphics make it complete. What I like about the characteristic of Emma is that she doesn't allow herself to be influenced by other things to choose the person she wants to be with. She doesn't actually bother to find anyone. After many hesitations she has (why I called the title dilemma) she finds her perfect match not only she but the other characters too, like the girl Harriet she was trying to match with someone. If you want to know who they eventually match with, you should definitely watch the movie.

I think the film is beautifully acted. It doesn't have the most unexpected plot but definitely recommended if you are looking for a movie to watch with friends or just when you want to watch a funny and good film to watch."
EMMA.,87,72,audience,"Besides those walks through the candy-colored, pastel corridors and rooms (gorgeous), and a joyous performance by Anya Taylor-Joy, I can't say much more of this film. The first half moves at such a low pace... It takes too long to actually start ""caring"" about their characters, and whatever cheesy, tangled love triangles they're in.

(I must admit I'm not the biggest fan of period films, so...)."
EMMA.,87,72,audience,"pretty much what you want it to be - painfully funny, charming and lush. Not a lot to say but very enjoyable."
EMMA.,87,72,audience,"1/10 not enough nose bleeds, it do be awkward tho."
EMMA.,87,72,audience,"Emma portrays very well a Jane Austen main character, which in itself is an excellent complement for Anya Taylor-Joy. Certain things that she speaks and the respect that she demands, for her and her friend are very interesting, given the fact the age of the novel was written in.
This is something that for the audience, the thought may seem shallow but it shows us a different kind of thinking of that time, and I think the message wasn't meant to be shallow, I think it was intended to show us even in that time that a woman shouldn't settle to marry a person that is expected of her to marry, and that she can get someone ""better"" for her life in what was perceived to be ""the place of a woman"" in that time. Nevertheless, this is to be expected, given the fact that the novel is from the writer that it is, and some of the quirkiness that Emma shows in certain scenes.
At the beginning of the movie, the characters are very ecstatic and there is a lot of symmetry in certain scenes which not uncommon in films, these two traits are very present in a Wes Anderson movie.
On a final note, I think that the humor of this movie was well done for the time it was portraying."
EMMA.,87,72,audience,"Proof that Austen's work is timeless and will forever be entertaining, Emma. is a brilliant adaptation and a fresh take on one of her most captivating novels. The film is undoubtedly one of the most well-crafted of its kind since Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice back in 2005. It's got a fantastic cast with the perfect lead in Anya Taylor-Joy, breathtaking set and costume design, and a delightful story that combines both drama and comedy exactly as Austen's words read. I absolutely loved the movie and can't wait to see Joy in more roles that showcase what a great actress she is."
EMMA.,87,72,audience,How many tones does Emma need to be remade? This was one too many and not the best version. The lead does not have the charisma to pull this off.
EMMA.,87,72,audience,"Entertaining enough and definitely modernizes this tale in a nice way but I still feel this is mostly an ""aesthetic"" film that needs to look and act a specific way for its demographics. I'm not usually a period piece person or British dramas so yeah, it was hard to connect to this, but still, these characters don't have much depth beyond witty and very written lines. Watch The Favourite for something that takes British period piece dramas to new heights with original and unique writing."

A funny cast and a witty script make this candy-coloured Jane Austen adaptation a bubbly, energetic watch.

2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Documentary,100,,audience,"Well I have to give the academy credit.. this year's crop of films doesn't include any terminally ill patients in hospice care so that's positive.. also no Syrian civil war stories (we got enough of those in the feature category this year).   The films that are included are a mixed bag.  ""Walk Run Cha-Cha"" is the slightest film.. a too-long story about a couple who dated in Vietnam but were separated after the war and eventually reunited and learned to dance... yawn.... ""St. Louis Superman"" is about an activist and ""battle rapper"" turned politician.. which is interesting.. though not developed enough... ""In the Absence"" is about a South Korean ferry disaster, which uses a lot of footage of the incident as well as recorded conversations.. This one I wanted to know more about but the film didn't provide enough information about the causes of the incident or the aftermath... it did make me want to google it when i got home though... ""Life Overtakes Me"" is about refugee kids in Sweden who regress into a coma like state...a condition I was not aware of... My favorite film of this lot was ""Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You're a Girl)"" which is about a group of young girls in Afghanistan who are being taught to read and to skateboard, in a culture that doesn't think girls should be taught this stuff. It was more positive, and the kids and teachers were so appealing I wanted to hear their stories."

2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Live Action,89,92,audience,I loved all these stories.
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Live Action,89,92,audience,"""A Sister:""

An intense, strongly directed and paced short that puts you right in the moment. I think the overall theme of people having a universal connection as complete strangers is great here, and by the time it ends, you feel like you were just in the midst of something bigger than a 17 minute short film.

""Brotherhood:""

Beautifully shot, subtly performed and altogether strikingly captivating. This is a film that runs on reflection and meditation in a way and yet is so gripping. Like a more suspenseful Terrence Malick. That end is painstakingly good.

""The Neighbors' Window:""

My favorite of the bunch. What starts out as a light and funny slice of family life turns into something so emotionally dense and is just flawlessly directed. Obviously, ""Rear Window"" is an influence on this but this more deals with the inevitable fears of aging and time more than the voyeurism at play. I was in complete tears near the end of this, having felt like I went through an entire feature film with many arcs off a 20 minute short film, which is quite an accomplishment.

""Saria:""

The story here is very good with obviously dire and important moments and a brutal conclusion that leaves you a bit angered, intentionally so. But I feel the directing style and the execution overall was too much. I couldn't actually latch onto the main girl in this story, and by the end didn't feel like I was on her side as much as I wanted to be, due to too many fast-paced scenes and frantic cutting as opposed to a more focused approach. It's good, but in comparison to the other shorts, not as effective.

""Nefta Football Club:""

Fun, interesting and well paced. The ending here is very good while simultaneously leaves you wanting more from the story, but I guess that's what a short is supposed to do in order to eventually move onto a feature someday. Seeing different cultures and worlds like this as an American always showcase fascinating material.

Overall, the shorts were great. ""The Neighbors' Window"" stood out by far as the best, but besides ""Saria,"" I was left pretty emotionally satisfied by all of them."

2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Live Action,89,92,audience,"This was a pretty good crop of films this year...  ""A Sister"" is about a woman who calls 911 from a car and pretends to be calling her sister so her rapist wont know who she is talking to and follows the operator attempting to help her. Fairly short but packed with alot of tension, helped along by the camerawork in the car is focused on the woman with only glimpses of what is around her. ""Brotherhood"" is about a young man who has returned to his parents house in Tunisia after having fought with ISIS in Syria. He has brought a young wife and the tension between him and his father is intense... Another film with tight cinematography and good work from the cast. ""The Neighbor's Window"" starts out like it's gonna be a comedy but becomes something more. A middle aged couple with young kids becomes fascinated with watching the exhibitionist twentysomethings that live in the apartment across the street... until they discover something that changes the narrative. ""Saria"" is the bleakest film.. it is about teenage girls in an orphanage in Guatemala and the horrible conditions and abuse they encounter there.. they try to escape but are caught and the ending is crushing. ""Nefta Football Club"" is the lightest film, an amusing tale about two boys in Tunisia (a popular locale this year) who come across a mule packed with drugs and what they do with it. That one was fun, and its good that it was included at the end of the set. These were all good films and this set is worth a watch."

2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Live Action,89,92,critic,"
Our favorite live-action short [is] Brotherhood. Exquisitely shot, it won't be surprising if this short is eventually expanded into a feature-length film.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Live Action,89,92,critic,"
Tunisia is the setting for two of this year's Live Action shorts in film, one a searing drama beneath the shadow of ISIS, the other a comedy involving a mule listening to the wrong music...
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Live Action,89,92,critic,"
Last year, Skin, the worst mini-movie I have ever seen, bar none, in my whole entire life won for live-action. I have no idea what these people are actually going to give the nekkid golden guy to this year...
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Another terrific batch of short films.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
My pick: I haven't seen a short film this year that is as full of pure joy as 'Hair Love.' I'd like to think that its sweet positivity will be the thing that, at this awful moment, gives it an edge.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Do yourself a favor and seek them out.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
There are real gems among these short films.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
This is essential viewing for Oscar fans... the shorts categories are among the most interesting and diverse of the night.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Another intriguing lineup of short films in a series that's become a worthwhile annual event.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Hair Love is likely to win and should...These are heartfelt, tender, emotional films that are not easy to dismiss...
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
This year's crop of animated shorts offer moving accounts of the importance of emotional connection.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Outside of ""Kitbull,"" which is cute but not much else, this is another strong category, but my favorite would have to be ""Memorable"" for the way that it finds an inspired visual motif to help fully communicate the themes of the narrative.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Some of the shorts are more artful than others, but most land with the saccharine emotional power you might expect from a Hallmark card.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
The animated offerings are highlighted by ""Memorable,"" an intimate look at a couple dealing with the onset of dementia.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
These ... aren't just escapist cartoons; they impart valuable and sometimes harsh lessons to viewers of all ages.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Friendship and family drama dominate the seriously artful selections for the 2020 Oscar Nominated Animated Shorts.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
The animation category is a quintet of clever two-handers about bonds new and old, perhaps tenuous but usually healing.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Even the most conventional-looking entries here have charms.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
The five nominees for the animated short prize are especially strong, and with three directed by women, they're a hopeful sign of increased opportunities behind the camera.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Get out your handkerchiefs, because rich tales of sadness constitute this year's selection of Oscar-nominated animated shorts.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
With any luck, this curiously uneven program will be capped by the terrific ""Maestro"", a French-made two minutes of Italian opera performed by nocturnal forest animals.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Don't sit down to watch this year's batch of animated shorts without a handful of Kleenex.
 "
2020 Oscar Nominated Shorts - Animation,95,,critic,"
Our favorite is the French stop-motion short Memorable. Through surreal imagery, [director Bruno Collet] finds a beautiful way to express his heartbreaking narrative. Think Amour if directed by Michel Gondry.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Noémie Merlant shines in Jumbo, an impressively unique modern fable exploring sexuality and rare connections.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
There's no denying that the debut feature from Zoé Wittock is shot beautifully, with the hypnotic light show that Jumbo produces luring you into its spider-like embrace.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
It's a far from perfect film, but it's a lot better than the critical consensus suggests, and at the heart of it is a fascinating character study.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
While Jumbo is certainly strange in its conceit, it does also show bravery in what committed, true love looks like.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Yet unfortunately, there are just too many jumps to make and spaces to fill to fully believe this fantastical obsession.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Merlant is divine in the leading role and her surprisingly touching connection with a piece of machinery - as ridiculous as it sounds - is one of the most captivating and moving onscreen relationships in recent memory.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
A strange and offbeat tale of sexual attraction and electronic intimacy.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Merlant is radiant as a woman lit up by love.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Wittock, who makes her feature debut, brings a wonderfully naïve, awestruck mood to the movie. It's probably no mistake that Jeanne's hairstyle resembles Amelie's; they're both wide-eyed observers of life's small mysteries and wonders.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
From its opening moments lit by neon lights and set to the soundtrack of their gentle buzz, Jumbo marks a heady debut for writer-director Zoé Wittock.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Though curiously charming, Jumbo behaves like love at first sight that doesn't think about the consequences of the ardent now or the larger, long-term picture.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Wittock's story ... is almost absent of any form of psychological inspection.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Jumbo is a film that grabs the viewer with great, beautiful visuals and strong performances from the leads and makes the most of an unusual situation and attraction.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Jumbo just can't go anywhere beyond its initial premise. It's a shame too, since there's so much promise within it.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
So will Jumbo take Jeanne's heart for a ride? And should we object to her sexuality if she's not hurting anyone? These questions, and more, abound in the out-there, but not-like-anything-else-out-there, ""Jumbo.""
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Zoé Wittock's debut exhibits a great deal of craft with its stunning visuals and a sound design that will make you believe Jumbo is a sentient being, but her narrative lags behind, the story never getting beyond a conceptual phase.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
Certainly the best movie I've ever seen about a woman in love with an amusement park ride.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
The film felt torn between these two ends all along, and it's disappointing that it settled for the mundane.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
First time writer-director Zoé Wittock takes an absurd idea and imbues it with such heart, soul, and beauty that you'll automatically look past the inherent ridiculousness. Instead, you'll simply absorb its glowing sense of wonder.
 "
Jumbo,74,,critic,"
It's a quirky film to be sure, but one that never feels twee. It's honest, light, and quite artful to look at.
 "
Redoubt,86,,audience,"Wordless. Stunningly beautiful. Enigmatic.

If the Mona Lisa is high art, ""Redoubt"" is for the same reason - no back story, little ""front story,"" but enough mystery and beauty to hold your attention for 134 minutes (can the Mona Lisa do that?) One of the few movies I've wanted to see again, immediately after seeing it.

A trio of hunters, an older couple who make art from metal, and a forest ranger - three groups that barely interact in the snow-covered mountains of Idaho (of all places!). The hunters are played by beautiful women which certainly adds an element that will please most viewers. One is a firearms expert; the other two spend the film moving in very odd ways that could be called dance.

The setting and story are full of mystery, and although ""something"" does happen in the final act, it hardly resolves the primary mystery: who are these people and what are they doing here? The hunters, in particular, seem to have no abode - they live in trees in these mountains, seemingly hundreds of miles from any source of electricity - and electric light - except what you bring yourself.

The modern (solar panels, wildlife cameras), classic (high-powered rifles, electroplating) and ancient - the hills which are thousands if not millions of years old, share an uneasy but necessary symbiance.

If you have strong feelings against hunting or the glorification of firearms, these issues will probably prevent you for enjoying this movie.

The credits indicate that the hunting scenes were simulated, but everything else is real.  No CGI, composites or matte paintings were used, and no handheld or Steadicam either - although drones provide the wonderful aerial views.

""Redoubt"" draws comparisons to ""The Revenant,"" ""Tree of Life,"" and Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"" and ""Stalker,"" none of which I cared for, and ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" which I like very much.  Speaking of which, the music in ""Redoubt"" is even more avant-garde, and certainly helps to carry the film.

There were two shots - a generously-exposed view of the night sky, and a tree-climbing sequence, that were so amazing I could have watched them for the entire length of the film (in fact, I believe I said ""WOW!"" out-loud to the tree shot), but director/writer/imagineer Matthew Barney continues to find new things to show us, even into the sixth act (or ""hunt"" as he calls them).

Perhaps a knowledge of the mythology of hunter Diana would help to understand the film - perhaps the title means something (re-finding doubt?) - but without really understanding any of it, I was mesmerized by this film, and I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to experience a completely alternative view of life on Earth.

--gdavisloop"
Redoubt,86,,critic,"
Redoubt is undoubtedly a continuation of Barney's unique modern day myth-making process. And its hypnotic images have to be experienced on the big screen.
 "
Redoubt,86,,critic,"
""Redoubt"" is slow going but not uninvolving.
 "
Redoubt,86,,critic,"
The trouble with this film, at least from a cinematic perspective, is that it doesn't really grip. It's alluring, it's beguiling, but like Diana herself, it has no intention of going any further.
 "
Redoubt,86,,critic,"
Barney's best work has occasionally pulled off the feat of being enthralling and ridiculous at the same time, though Redoubt sometimes ends up being merely the latter.
 "
Redoubt,86,,critic,"
Matthew Barney re-instills nature with some of the mystic aura that modernity, with its technologies and techniques of knowledge, has robbed it of.
 "
Redoubt,86,,critic,"
""Redoubt"" reaches for intimations and apprehensions of the cosmic.
 "
Redoubt,86,,critic,"
An art-film riff on ""The Revenant,"" patiently paced, but hardly tedious...
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Infused with real-life experience and a sense of place, showing the authentic rhythms of Vegas life beyond the Strip.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Jezebel doesn't treat sex work as a last resort. It treats it as a normal occupation, free of stigma and tragedy. In under 90 minutes, Perrier overturns negative tropes, and uses her personal story to overcome a collective shame that exists in sex work.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
So perfunctory and edge-free that it plays as incomplete, a movie ""talked"" into great reviews by hearing the filmmaker's personal connection to the story.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
I wish I liked this film more than I do... The movie does not really have a sense of who its characters are.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
""Jezebel"" is a reminder that in everyday human stories is proof that the world is wide, and that in going behind the doors that movies rarely open, there are even more worlds worth discovering.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Tiffany's journey has its ascents and plunges. Perrier and her star keep us caring where it will end: peak or valley?
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
A simple story about the women behind the sex-trade industry - women who are often scared, often desperate, but, although often lost amid our tut-tutting, still human beings.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Jezebel feels authentic, because it is: a different kind of coming-of-age film and a non-judgmental look at an industry that is often shrouded in secrecy.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Such an environment is rarely depicted with any kind of nuance, but [Numa] Perrier disdains the hysterics and melodrama which so often accompany such depictions to deliver a deeply complex portrait of sex workers and the industry.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Jezebel is, at its core, a coming-of-age film that jumps head first into this sensual world - all without being voyeuristic.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
There are no cheap movie tricks or special effects, just impressive cinematography and lighting to evoke sexual tension, and a solid story to carry the film from one plot beat to the next.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Numa Perrier wraps you in a cocoon of safety as we traverse Jezebel's difficult material together.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Based on a true story, this is director/screenwriter Numa Perrier's story. It took her a while, understandably, to be ready to share it with the rest of the world. She and her film present a twist on the typical coming of age story.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Perrier's [Jezebel] inserts themes relating to standards of beauty, a normalization of sexual-based work, and female empowerment... and is a simple and contained family drama, and coming of age piece.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Dealing with its potentially discomfiting subject matter with sensitivity, insight and humor, Jezebel marks an auspicious debut for its director/screenwriter who also plays a supporting role.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
This is a warm-hearted and positive story about a young woman taking control of her life, and it's refreshing to see such stories being told about working class women in stigmatised professions.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
Perrier brings an intense affection to her story and characters.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
While the characters may have to fight for every inch of the lives they carve out for themselves, the filmmaker's light touch with such combustible material show an ease with pushing into new territory.
 "
Jezebel,89,45,critic,"
'Jezebel' is a film that is not judgemental or even takes a side with its protagonist, in fact, you empathize with young Tiffany, even though she's making a myriad of bad decisions.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
As with many resonant works of narrative art, its extreme particularity has universal echoes.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
Poignant and eye-opening.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
[An] unblinking but admirably impartial film.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
This is a film that puts tough questions before us in a startlingly contemporary context, which has been created by capitalism.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
It's difficult to engage meaningfully with some of the subjects when the filmmaker is content to accept the fact that they only have their façades to offer.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
Mother is a terrific piece of work with a unique take on an issue that we can all understand, with poignant and surprisingly touching messages layered throughout.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
MOTHER provides a powerful insight into the ethical and moral considerations around 'outsourcing' care.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
Mother may be many things at once, but is always most directly about the bonds of love, however frayed they become.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
A touching documentary about the three virtues of a compassionate caregiver.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
The film is beautifully shot without ever being pushy about themes, offering remarkable insight into a variety of issues.
 "
Mother,91,,critic,"
These subjects have been the focus of documentaries before but rarely in this combination and with such an unflinching resolve to keep filming in uncomfortable moments.
 "
Final Account,71,,critic,"
Holland reminds us - if recent images of neo-Nazis storming the steps of the Reichstag haven't already - of another disease that demands constant vigilance.
 "
Final Account,71,,critic,"
Holland shows how people can be swept up in events and be a part of something even when they are blissfully unaware of the ramifications. Does this make them innocent? It's a big question.
 "
Final Account,71,,critic,"
Its ambitions are too high. On the one hand, it treats viewers like newcomers to the Shoah, and yet at the same time expects them to engage in complex questions of responsibility and guilt.
 "
Final Account,71,,critic,"
Holland proves a skilled inquisitor and eventually forces uncomfortable truths out of his subjects.
 "
Final Account,71,,critic,"
Holland's documentary ends up being too much, but also not quite enough.
 "
Final Account,71,,critic,"
A sobering round-up of voices from the Third Reich.
 "
Final Account,71,,critic,"
A simple, unadorned study of everyday evil, one which balances eye-witness accounts with archive footage and wintry location shots of mountains, forests and leaf-blown railway tracks.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
An intelligent and clear-sighted piece of filmmaking, it is a highly accomplished first directorial outing by Nikou.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
Nikou's film is disappointingly literal compared to others from the Greek Weird Wave. Still, it's not without its wry pleasures.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
There's sadness here for isolation and a grief that goes beyond the loss of a single life once lived. There's also a heightened sense of the smaller absurdities of existence.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
Even in its methodical lows, there's plenty in Apples to ruminate over, and that's the mark of an intriguing debut.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
'Apples' mixes enough deadpan humour and surrealist absurdity to declare Christos Nikou is a filmmaker to keep an eye on.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
[It] regards humanity with both warmth and disdain.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
""Apples"" is subtle throughout, but delivers a complex existential journey with deep meaning.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
At times suffocating, although the Greek director manages to turn that impact around, turning the experience into an absolutely magnetic one. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
The Greek Weird Wave is alive and well in Christos Nikou's hands, and he points to how the national cinema's movement can continue to grow.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
Apples casts a peculiar spell in places; at a somewhat unfocused 90 minutes, it's a good idea more than a great movie, but an end-twist implores you to look back over what you've just seen and consider it through another, more plaintively humanist lens.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
Goes far beyond... philosophical disquisitions. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
Greece has never looked this empty. But the world has never felt this hollow, and it's fortuitous that Apples is reaching audiences at the exact moment when the story on the screen matches the world surrounding it.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
It's a mostly quiet tale, carried by the human performances and minimalist plot, elevated by a handful of delicious ambiguities left behind when the credits roll.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
It has an essence of its own and an overwhelming tenderness that proves to be effective all the way through the last frame. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
Apples lays bare the struggles of losing some vital part of your soul. It shines an unusual spotlight on what it means to experience, what it means to capture and hold on to memories, and what it means to find your way back-to the world, and to yourself.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
The characters are awkward, the dialogue is affectedly deadpan, the colours are muted, and the mood is sombre. Where Nikou distinguishes himself from [Lanthimos] is in his more marked humanist approach.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
What is genuine is the evocation of loss and a deep sense of anguish.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
Very much in the vein of what has been dubbed the Greek ""weird wave"", it may also delight admirers of Swedish absurdist Roy Andersson with its drily humorous tableaux.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
In divorcing [...] from any modern touchstone - smartphones, laptops, internet - APPLES smartly suggests the absurdity of [modern social] trends and their purpose. The sad emptiness pierces through if you take away the modernity.
 "
Apples,100,,critic,"
[T]he droll Twilight Zone absurdism is not without its pleasures, many of them comic.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
One of the world's great directors returns briefly to prove that a good storyteller can grab you any tools at their disposal, even during lockdown.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
Pedro Almodóvar and Tilda Swinton combine their talent in this intimate story of loneliness and abandonment that resonates in today's world of social distancing and virtual communication. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
The Human Voice is another in a long line of brilliant works by Almodovar.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
Swindon's extraordinary performance makes it nearly impossible to look away.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
...the Scot and the Spaniard have whipped up a riotously colorful bit of manic Almodóvarian melodrama.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
It's a bravura performance, since we never hear the lover's voice. Swinton performs her monologue into an iPhone, shifting from lies to truths the way one shifts from one foot to another while waiting for a bus.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
The Human Voice is all about the muddied lines between the fabricated and the genuine, and about how much a performance can be divorced from the sincere feelings that might be undergirding it.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
With this 30-minute visual morsel he further evolves the nesting dolls of stories he's built around the same French monodrama.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
Color and passion ignite in Pedro Almodóvar's English-language debut.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
On a moment-to-moment basis, Swinton, backed up by her adoring director, cinematographer (José Luis Alcaine), costume designer (Sonia Grande) and cinematographer (Alberto Iglesias), delivers a can't-take-your-eyes-off-her performance.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
Each word is scorching, and Swinton never chews the decadent scenery... even though there is plenty of it to chew on.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
Worthy of Almodóvar's universe. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
One moment, Swinton is lamenting a lover's departure with a plaintiveness that could make your heart crack - and the next she's pacing feverishly across the floor, glinting axe in hand. As if we didn't already know it, the woman has range.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
Based on the Jean Cocteau play, this is Pedro Almodovar's first English-language film, and it's a remarkable bit of surrealism with a sustained emotional intensity.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
The actress-filmmaker synergy is so intense that one misses knowing what happens to this woman when, finally, she learns to hang up the phone. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
Hopefully, this isn't the first and last collaboration between Almodovar and Swinton, because this short film is an extremely enjoyable experience.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
Encapsulates the sophistication of films from La Mancha in recent years from its opening credits. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
If it begins with elaborately sad, art school indulgence, The Human Voice certainly ends on something that feels more fresh, tangible and hopeful.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
The Human Voice is an utterly gorgeous short film from Pedro Almodovar that features a glorious performance from Tilda Swinton.
 "
The Human Voice,97,,critic,"
An entrancingly strange one-hander and a fitting paean to the present global vibe of isolation and alienation. And like the very best shorts, it leaves you eager to see more.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,audience,"It's not really for me, but I can understand why people love this movie: amazing cinematography and stellar performances etc....this movie also adds something fresh to its genre and taught me a lot."
Nomadland,94,80,audience,"nice wonderful movie i have ever watched 
https://suprapacific.com/"
Nomadland,94,80,audience,"What a depressing slog without reward. And by reward I don't mean ending sad can't be. All that depression for nothing. A slice of life film is fine but Nomadland abandoned such and just kept going. I felt nothing for the characters despite the fact that they had plenty of reason to make me feel for them. Empathy by way of filming people with nothing is not endearing on its own. That's cheap. It's hard to care for McDormand's snap at her ""normie"" friend about her way of life when it is on her. She only need sacrifice by accepting help for a little bit. Even if that is right for character, why do I want to watch someone like that?

Perhaps my expectations were possibly too high for the film. Or maybe it was seeing in close proximity to the far superior The Sound of Metal that had a similar tempo in its meditation on life. And the crossroads dilemma of that film actually did have the semblance of an arc. I won't say Nomadland is boring, but I wouldn't recommend seeing it when not alert. I can only think the director is getting awards attention for only having about three seasoned actors in the group, making her work with the nomads playing themselves seem impressive. Which doesn't make sense as most everyone was flat. This is akin to an actor getting an Oscar merely because they put their body through hell for a role. She chose to use amateurs. And it shows, they are terrible for the most part.

This is a film that has the same social valuation but with opposite sentiment as Joker. Many folks hated Joker in advance and forced the onus rather than experienced it. But at least that film had a divisive nature to it. In this case, I think a bunch of critics and audience members followed their bleeding hearts before ever absorbing the actual characters. I have a bleeding heart and feel for the suffering, but I was able to avoid buying into such a pandering display. You must earn it and this is just junk. Most people will remember it fondly and won't watch it again. Or if they do will find themselves embarrassed for being so fooled."
Nomadland,94,80,audience,Beautiful and sad....this movie had a lot in common with our last year. Francis McDormand is brilliant and is not acting.
Nomadland,94,80,audience,"Nomadland beautifully captures the poetic journey of those who were destitute of all, but still finds the courage to keep living - writer-director Chloé Zhao is brilliantly able to convey a powerful experience that transcends the limits of life and art while  Frances McDormand's tour de force resonates loud to deliver a larger-than-life masterpiece."
Nomadland,94,80,audience,"This magnificent film made me want to throw away everything I own and hit the road. A film that came to me (and maybe to a lot of us) at the right time. A time when we miss hugging, and loving, and hanging, and being out there with our loved ones, some of which are no longer here. 

Frances McDormand delivers (once again) a masterclass in acting, being as natural and free as she can be, in this primal, intimate, and powerful portrait of the nomad life. Chloé Zhao's exquisite direction takes us on a journey full of amazing landscapes, memories, heartbreak, and grief with this film that teaches us how to reconcile with life."
Nomadland,94,80,audience,A very well made drama with great cinemtography and acting that isn't really my thing. I still highly recommend it though.
Nomadland,94,80,audience,"Película intrascendente sin principio ni fin, nada recordable."
Nomadland,94,80,audience,So depressing... I feel like throwing myself under a bus! Take a pass if you want to be uplifted!!!
Nomadland,94,80,audience,Frances McDormand is an extraordinary artist.  I was not so impressed by the movie itself as with the experience of watching her.
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Like Tina Fey with Mean Girls and Charlie Kaufman with Adaptation., Chloé Zhao has taken a non-fiction book and, through cinematic alchemy, transformed it into a fictional feature film.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
One of the melancholy pleasures of Chloé Zhao's masterful new film Nomadland is determining where the fact ends and the fiction begins.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Strange, affecting and melancholy, Nomadland leaves one with a lingering feeling of sadness for a society that is fraying at the edges, scattering small fragments across the map of America.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
McDormand's performance is exactly what you would expect from the Oscar winner: honest, vulnerable, and, at times, uncomfortable to look at straight-on.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Nomadland has no plot or subplot, no character or narrative arc, no easily discernible thesis or moral. It just kind of ""is."" It's The Grapes of Wrath without the wrath. So, you know, grapes... But grapes are good, I guess?
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
A great American road film...
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Ii could not have been made anywhere but the United States. The vast expanses of the Western desert, the purple mountains' chilly majesty, provide a stark, flat, unwelcoming setting for the story about retirees and other Americans living in their vans.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
""Nomadland"" is a character study and a cultural glimpse at another side of economic struggle and freedom.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Nomadland takes audiences on a raw, real, wondrous journey...
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Strangely hypnotic in its simplicity.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
an astonishing piece a work-a film that is both simple and profound, a genuine heir to the principled spirit of Italian neorealism
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Zhao's craft here is unparalleled, and Joshua James Richards' cinematography utterly astonishing.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
It's dreamy, even spiritual, to see characters left behind by mainstream society unspool their lives against the American West's abundant beauty.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Nomadland treats its subjects with respect and curiosity. Their misfortunes are not used to objectify or other them, as often happens in movies about an impoverished subculture.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Underneath a shell that alternates between wariness and basic decency, Fern's inner strength is never in doubt; whether that will be enough to survive in this world is the tension that drives this film
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
I don't use the word ""masterpiece"" very often, but Nomadland deserves the appellation here, for sure.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Nomadland works on its own uniquely seductive level, which is closely tied to McDormand's extremely seductive performance.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Nomadland is one of the most understated and quietly painful films I have seen.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
The movie is beautifully made. It's also heartwarming bulls---... This is the nicest movie about homelessness, financial despair and human frailty you'll ever see.
 "
Nomadland,94,80,critic,"
Nomadland is a rich and rewarding character-driven film that blends almost documentary-like observational scenes of Fern's encounters with the people that she meets on the road with moments of sublime beauty.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
The final scene of Tamhane's new film ... is its strongest, a remarkable and complex concretization of India's past and present.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
Chaitanya Tamhane again, proves himself to be one of the brightest and most talented filmmakers working today.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
Indian classical music may sound strange to an ear accustomed to American pop, rock and rap, but the emotions generated by The Disciple are familiar. A great foreign film taps into those universal things.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
Tamhane slowly and meticulously opens the floodgates between the spiritual and physical worlds as technology becomes more intrusive, allowing for a jarring (and at times necessary) cross-pollination of sights, sounds and ideas.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
Well shot, produced, written and directed. Chaitanya Tamhane sends a transcendental postcard from India filled with soothing music and enlightening insights as the old mixes with the new.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
While it is sometimes too quiet, The Disciple is particularly effective when it locks the viewers in a bubble with Sharad and allows him moments to respond to the music.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
If you're able to give yourself over to it, there's a quiet brutality to this tale of dogmatic obsession, shot and performed with simmering intensity as it is.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
An absorbing character study.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
It's about acceptance of the direction of your life, and questioning of the years you worked to achieve the now-impossible. For Sharad, it's heart-shattering. For us, it's memory-inducing.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
Tamhane's film is actually a multi-layered, multi-faceted character study that uses its strong sense of place to tell an essential tale about having to live with one's own mediocrity.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
Director Chaitanya Tamhane immerses his viewers into Sharad's all-consuming world.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
The film immerses the viewer in the intoxicating world of Hindustani classical music with a razor-focused clarity, examining the interplay of the relationships between teacher and disciple, art and artist, and artist and audience.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
Chaitanya Tamhane gives full dimension to the rich, complex, and sometimes contradictory nature of the relationship between disciple and guru.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
[An] exceptional slow burning character study that builds tension so carefully, one barely realizes the emotional journey they're being taken on.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
A journey of art and dedication with exquisite artistic elements but low accessibility. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
Anyone who's ever devoted themselves fully to a craft, only to suspect that the rest of the world barely gives a shit, will relate to The Disciple.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
...a punishingly deliberate drama that is, for the most part, unable to wholeheartedly capture the viewer's interest...
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
It's a stirring cinematic tribute to Indian classical music that gradually reveals an unexpected multitude of layers.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
The truth lies inward, The Disciple teaches us - and it often hurts.
 "
The Disciple,96,,critic,"
""The Disciple"" is more about the journey than the destination, with a conclusion that suggests the student never really becomes the teacher when the subject is his own life.
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
Mainstream hardly qualifies as a satisfactory, much less intelligent response to the media-saturated simulacra it lounges very comfortably within.
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
A horrifically empty ""social media satire""...
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
And yet, while Mainstream demonstrates little restraint, there's a toothlessness to its out-of-touch commentary and its Pollockian approach to seeing what sticks.
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
'Mainstream' hybridizes the old and the new, the noble cinephile references and a trash aesthetic, which turns the film into a small-scale laboratory of the aesthetic-cultural earthquake of our time. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
Mainstream takes a while (and a lot of hipster costume changes) to get there, but it eventually throws up some pertinent questions to ponder...
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
A big, blunt, sanctimonious satire of YouTuber idolatry that, for all its bug-eyed, pin-balling energy, never feels remotely ahead of the curve.
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
It's a messy, childish scrawl of a film, but it is high on energy.
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
Mainstream never transcends the impasse of being another update of the old story about hipster radicals challenging the system only to be devoured by it...
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
The plot is just as predictable as the themes. Everyone watching will know where it's going, although the viewer's imagined version of the screenplay will likely be shrewder than the one written by Coppola and Tom Stuart.
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
Soon becomes the very thing it sets out to expose: a glittery, jangly image machine that manufactures little of actual substance, except the conclusion that social media = bad.
 "
Mainstream,36,,critic,"
Mainstream is a cautionary tale to approach with caution, deserving of a like but perhaps not quite a subscribe.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
[Director Quentin Dupieux] is definitely going for a ""Dumb and Dumber"" vibe that transcends borders and the combination of the goofball schtick from the two stars and the surreal sight of that giant fly never quite wears out its welcome.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
The most nonsensical comedy directed by the French surrealist expert. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
Throughout his career, Dupieux has carved out a niche for telling truly oddball stories, and Mandibles is easily his most accessible effort to date.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
Mandibles is an unexpectedly warmhearted crime fable about friendship, foolishness, and a giant fly.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
Mandibles eventually overstays its welcome though, employing a plethora of gags that feel more grating than gratifying.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
There is something inherently likable about the way Dupieux depicts his two moronic stars and Ludig and Marsais' performances imbue them with a Dude-like sense of purposelessness.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
This is simply a very funny, if deeply weird, little movie.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
[Manu is] a character perfectly suited for writer/director Quentin Dupieux's surreally absurdist comedies of which [this] might be the tightest (77-minutes) and silliest yet.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
One of Quentin Dupieux's most beautiful and accessible films. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
In the otherwise stale world of French comedies, Dupieux stands so far out in left field that he's become a genre unto himself.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
What makes ""Mandibules"" so refreshing is that, just as its anti-heroes don't care about how they are supposed to behave, Dupieux has an airy disregard for how a chase thriller or a horror movie is supposed to proceed.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
The really new news of ""Mandibles"" however, is, where in the past Dupieux's surrealism always had a cynical, sinister, even murderous undercurrent, here, he lets himself be cheerful.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
Dupieux milks all the comedy he can from the slender concept, and knows not to outstay his welcome.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
""Mandibles"" is as brazenly and riotously stupid as it sounds, but with a chill, dopey sweetness that makes it stick.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
A truly touching and optimistic saga on friendship. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
Absurd and brilliant. Dupieux's return to the big screen is at turns wonderfully comical and viscerally tragic.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
If the ""Basil the Rat"" episode of Fawlty Towers had been written and directed by Luis Buñuel, the result might have been something like this.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
Shows the talented French musician and director abandoning the wilful Mondo Bizzarro surrealism and fourth-wall metacinema trickery of his early films and maturing into a seasoned, audience pleasing maverick.
 "
Mandibles,95,,critic,"
A rollicking, rambunctious tequila-dream of a movie...
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
Britain hasn't lost the ability to make films like this after all. We've had it stashed in the back of the wardrobe all along.
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
Bring your mum and your gran (or anyone's gran if yours is not available) preferably to a matinee, and you'll have a delightful time and be home, whistling cheerfully, in time for tea.
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
Throughout everything Broadbent is astounding, both foolish and infuriating, but also deeply sympathetic.
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
The script by Richard Bean and Clive Coleman is full of delightfully droll dialogue, and director Roger Michell keeps things as light and sharp as lemon soufflé.
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
Gloriously entertaining, with Broadbent and Mirren on excellent form. A quintessentially British film which, while it doesn't reinvent the cinematic experience, is sure to be enjoyed by many.
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
It's a quirky but stirring tale, beautifully scripted by Richard Bean and Clive Coleman, while director Roger Michell brings the same sureness of comedic touch he applied to the likes of Notting Hill and Venus.
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
Clever from the title on down.
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
Broadbent's considerable charisma as a prototype social justice warrior is just about enough to pull the rag-and-bone cart home on a film which becomes more defiantly contrived as it goes on.
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
What a lovely, rousing, finally moving film this is.
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
A perfectly nimble, kind-hearted bit of teatime entertainment - ideally tailored to Jim Broadbent in one of his most appealing big-screen roles.
 "
The Duke,100,,critic,"
This is the kind of British film with international appeal: the venerable cast, genial tone, inspirational story, and mischievous English eccentricity are all present and correct. Settle in, preferably with a nice cup of tea to hand, and enjoy.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,audience,"A must-watch film! Simply masterful. While you watch, you'll feel like you're on a journey with the athletes. After you watch, you'll feel inspired, fired up, and ready to take on new challenges. If you could give a film six stars, I would."
Rising Phoenix,86,98,audience,"Informative and inspiring!  Tells the backstory of the Paralympics (parallel to the Olympics) and some of the amazing elite athletes.  We see them overcome extreme adversity and find a way to thrive and excel.  Their positive attitudes, perseverance, support for each other, and strength are examples for all of us on how to approach challenges."

Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
It's triumphalism all the way, with eyes on the prize and no thought given to the daily struggle many face just to stay alive.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
This documentary was beautifully designed and directed. The 105 minute run time packs in more than expected while keeping the viewer interested.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
This is just an extraordinary documentary. It covers the history of the Paralympic Games, and it does so from a historical perspective and a very intimate profile of several athletes... These stories are so inspiring.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
This is profoundly inspiring... It is an extraordinary look at what makes us human.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
Thoughtful Paralympic Games docu has strong language.

Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
[A] beautifully-crafted and powerful documentary, one that celebrates its subjects with the pure joy of sport. These people don't need labeling or qualification. They are athletes, full stop.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
[T]he film is largely generic; a simple, stirring advert for the Games' power to inspire.

These people make Stallone's Rocky look like an underachiever.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
In absence of the 2020 Paralympics, which has been postponed to next year due to COVID19, Rising Phoenix presents a timely opportunity to revisit some of the most memorable moments of this extraordinary event.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
A stylistically solid, thoroughly watchable overview of the Paralympic Games - and it certainly isn't short on uplifting stories.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
""Phoenix"" is a testament to resiliency, determination and passion, and is one of the best documentaries of 2020.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
You will never watch the games in the same way.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
By avoiding complexity, ""Rising Phoenix"" preserves its inspiring mood, but offers only a platform for champions who already dominate the arena.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
What holds the documentary back from greatness is what makes the games themselves great: the tension and heat of conflict, the anticipation and revelation of the final outcome.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
The film would have been more effective if its relentlessly uplifting score didn't keep figuratively prodding the viewer in the chest, telling us to feel moved, dammit.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
It is all assembled with great skill by directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui and cinematographer Will Pugh.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
Rising Phoenix, a documentary now streaming on Netflix, feels like such a thing, a replacement for the now-postponed 2020 Paralympics in Tokyo that carries the torch for that prestigious event, its storied history, and its inspiring competitors.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
Marvel Studios and DC/WB may think they've cornered the market on superhero movies, but after watching the athletes in RISING PHOENIX, you'll realize just who are the genuine articles.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
Exactly the reminder of what resilience can achieve the world needs right now.
 "
Rising Phoenix,86,98,critic,"
There are athletes all across the spectrum of sport who would kill to have a documentary portray them as heroic, epic and badass as Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui paint the superstars in ""Rising Phoenix.""

You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
Baxter comes-up with some clever conceits.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
The coverage of Trump's 2016 campaign that pads out the film was already old news at the time; now it's vintage archive material - a resonant trip back to a world where hardly anyone thought he would win.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
The same points are made and remade, the same footage and quotes reused, mirroring the repetitive churn of 24-hour news.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
I wouldn't call You've Been Trumped Too an eye opener as much of what is portrayed is already public knowledge, but if you're sitting on the fence on Donald Trump, it may still be worth a watch.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
You've Been Trumped Too is pitched solely at the comatose viewer, as there is absolutely nothing in Anthony Baxter's film that you won't already be aware of.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
There's nothing as condemnatory in this stirring documentary as the Donald himself.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
Though Baxter recycles a lot of material from the first two films, he gets some interesting results ,,,
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
There could hardly be a more urgent or relevant film than this.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
A disappointing and mostly flimsy sequel to Anthony Baxter's powerful 2011 documentary
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
This is a timely and necessary reminder of Trump's practices.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
Draws a chilling parallel between Donald Trump's behaviour towards a small Scottish community, and his likely treatment of the American people if elected.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
You can probably see Donald Trump's pants on fire from wherever you're reading this.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
It doesn't help that Baxter himself is ineffectual as both a journalist and a filmmaker, always trying to place himself within the eyeline of his of lens or emphasise what he's doing rather than what Trump is doing.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
As a portrait of a man, it's ugly; as an insight into modern politics, it's both astute and damning.
 "
You've Been Trumped Too,74,44,critic,"
A British filmmaker documents the arrogance and disdain with which Donald Trump wields the power of his money... a warning for Americans come Election Day.

The movie makes a good point, then makes it over and over again.

The One and Only Ivan,71,68,audience,What a great movie and lots of fun to watch
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,audience,Beautiful movie and clever
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,audience,"Lovely film very emotional in places and a great ending, Cranston was also fantastic"
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,audience,"Amazing story, heartwarming!"
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,audience,"If you're a fan of the book, you'll be a fan of the movie. It has all of the good elements the book has."
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,audience,"Nothing all that fresh, but it certainly made me feel for the characters so that's always a big plus.

The cast elevate the film, for sure! Bryan Cranston, no matter the nature of any role he plays, is always enjoyable and/or likeable. He brings heart as Mack, as do Sam Rockwell (Ivan) and Angelina Jolie (Stella). I liked Danny DeVito as Bob, while Ariana Greenblatt portrays the wholesome Julia well.

The (true) premise is something we've all seen before, as such you're just waiting for the 'penny to drop' so the film can get going - once that happens onscreen events do improve, culminating in a very touching end. 'The One and Only Ivan' is ideal for family viewing, I'd say."
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,audience,"It's not very eventful. I just watched it and it's already a bit forgettable. I enjoy the message about animals not belonging in captivity. But unlike some other animated films meant for kids, this one didn't offer much for me, a 31 year old man. It was pretty predictable and generic."
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,audience,"Was not expecting this level of nuance from a kids movie on the subject of closing roadside zoos. Not easy to do this kind of thing without feeling too preachy, but I think this nails it. CGI and acting are both better than you get from most streaming-first movies. Enjoyable watch."
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,audience,"A pesar de mantener un ambiente trágico de principio a fin, la historia es muy bonita, al ponerle voces a los animales, hace que la película sea entendible y el diseño de los animales está muy bien lograda, es una película muy recomendada para ver en familia."
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
The One and Only Ivan is a Disney movie through-and-through, for better or worse. It has plenty of moments for both kids and adults to enjoy, even if its take on the story is only skin deep.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
The gently paced drama contains life lessons about leadership, treating all living creatures with kinship, love and respect and the value of promises. Best of all, it preaches and practices empathy for humans and animals.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
The messages it propounds - the ills of an anthropocentric worldview, compassion towards our fellow living organisms, and so on - may be old, but the film works by doing most things right and telling a charming story that should appeal to all ages.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
An unexpectedly moving construct of modern movie magic and old-fashioned sincerity.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
An old fashioned, sweet, feel good movie that works for kids and also adults who love animals. The script left sloppy loose ends, but the always amazing Brooklynn Prince, who voices Ruby, can make anyone's heart melt.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
Heartwarming, if a little obvious, this is excellent family film fun from Disney. With a cheery cast and a thick layer of schmaltz, it's exactly what you'd expect - but that's not a bad thing here.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
The One and Only Ivan may prove too melancholic for young kids, but the animals inspire awe, and the film draws winningly on Disney classics like Dumbo and Bambi.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
[A film] with all the nuances that a film for all audiences allows... thanks to its director, Thea Sharrock. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
Reminiscent of ""Charlotte's Web,"" it's a touching, tender tale for tiny tots...
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
Heartwarming film for all. The original song ""Free"" written by iconic songwriter Diane Warren, sets the tone and intended message of the film.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
It has whimsy and heart and is emotional but not depressing.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
It's okay for families, but I don't think there's anything great or new here.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
It doesn't feel like the film knows what it wants to be, and I think the biggest problem is that it brushes up against some really thorny territory like animal captivity and freedom... And yet it seems to really lack the teeth to go there.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
The director and writer do introduce plot twists that are not in the book, but they should have gone further. They soften bits of it, with the younger viewers in mind. They should have had us on the edge of our seats...
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
The film is sweet, simple, and utterly Disney-fied. There's a slight amount of thematic complexity to the tale, yet it's not so complex that smaller kids are incapable of understanding it.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
Thankfully, Mike White's script is snappy enough to make this more engaging than expected, creating vivid characters while drawing in some pungent ideas in a way that's never pushy.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
This expertly tear-jerking Disney movie seamlessly combines human actors with expressive CGI animals, and even manages a happy ending out of a horrible true story.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
It's not going to change your life but it is worth a watch with the family
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
The One and Only Ivan is a frighteningly relevant family film that just misses greatness but should find a decent audience with family's stuck at home.
 "
The One and Only Ivan,71,68,critic,"
Big-hearted adaptation should please fans of the book.
 "
Papicha,90,77,audience,"The main character is an energetic creative and free spirit girl, living in Algeria of the 90s. Though, some of the events depicted in this movie are somewhat true, but not to the extent shown here, which made the movie feel bogus and exaggerated.

Many scenes weren't necessarily and the introduction of the religious zealots was absurd and funny.

The new trend of empowering women movie's saga continues to spoil many attempts to create good cinema without falling in the trap of creating unnecessary conflicts between women and men, whether is it through religion, men dominance over women, work equality etc.

For anyone who is watching the movie without any knowledge about the situation of Algeria in the period of which this movie is supposed to take event, the 90s. Algeria was in a difficult political conflict where the Army didn't want to transfer power to the people, by doing so, killing the first real attempt to real democracy, this escalated the situation and the country fell in a civil war of 10 years.

Recent events clarified most of the lies that were circulating in the country by the Algerian government. The bloodiest Islamic zealots were army special forces, deployed to create fear in the harts of Algerian people, the only terrorists Algeria have ever known.

Just a side note, many Algerian women are proud Muslim, they have as much freedom as any other women in Western countries. Women in Algeria in general are well protected and valued, whether she wear a cover or not, and of course, like any other society, Algeria have its fair share of problems, but not the the extent shown in this over exaggerated movie.

Hope this helps."
Papicha,90,77,audience,Incredible movie. It was intense and hit you when you didn't expect it. I never researched what is happening in Algeria so it was very shocking to learn. Lyna Khoudri gave everything she had.
Papicha,90,77,audience,"An engaging tale about a conflict that's received little cinematic attention told from a unique narrative perspective. This fact-based dramatic feature film debut from director Mounia Meddour follows the efforts of an outspoken fashion design student seeking to make a sociopolitical statement about women's rights in her country during the 1990s Algerian Civil War and the aggressively intolerant (and often-deadly) tactics of Islamic fundamentalists to coerce compliance, even in matters of clothing. While some elements of the story seem a bit forced, the film nevertheless raises a variety of intriguing thematic issues using a unlikely but highly inventive form of symbolism. A truly pleasant surprise that emerges from a cinematically innovative premise."
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
... cinematography by Léo Lefèvre underlines Nedjima's creativity, in particular her eye for color in the fabrics she selects ... and the costumes by Catherine Cosme will convince you that Nedjima truly has a talent for fashion design.

Papicha,90,77,critic,"
Meddour builds to a bold ending that's all the more powerful for how shocking it is.
 "
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
While the final act frays a little, the sparking tensions of female friendship are vivid and persuasive.
 "
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
Can't wait to see more from Meddour, this is seriously powerful filmmaking.
 "
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
Like its magnetic lead, the film is alternately warm and viscerally angry, with scant patience for nuance.
 "
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
There is a scattershot emotional rhetoric here - but also idealism, and emotional force.
 "
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
[Director Mounia] Meddour intelligently takes advantage of the semantic field of fashion - Nedjma, played by Lyna Khoudri, wants to be a designer- to reflect on the fragility of women's freedom. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
It's a journey that's impossible not to become intensely emotionally invested in, and rising star Khoudri turns in a genuinely fierce performance...
 "
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
A quieter film might have made its points more powerfully; Papicha has a worthy message, but almost no dramatic restraint in delivering it.
 "
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
Strong performances, including from lead Lyna Khoudri, go a long way towards enlivening Meddour's film with an intimacy which is sometimes hobbled by ever widening clichés to enhance the tragedies of its finale.
 "
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
This film has such an energy to it... I had a ton of fun watching this and think people will really like it.
 "
Papicha,90,77,critic,"
[Leaves] no room for doubt that Meddour is a cinematic talent to watch with urgent things to say on the toughened and resilient female spirit.

Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
Steve Cameron Ferguson's camera always catching the details, a gold chain glinting here, a hand round a beer bottle there. Details sparkle in the script too, pared back to only what is needed
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
Box's debut performance is captivating and so full of depth in a wonderfully-told bittersweet story.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
Elevated by Steven Cameron Ferguson's gorgeously evocative cinematography and Riley's masterful observational style, Perfect 10 manages to be both socially aware and undeniably engaging.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
What emerges is sweet if slight, overcoming its awkward moments with that rarest of qualities: empathy.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
The sensitivity beneath the pair's apparent toughness is evident at every turn, and the bittersweet ending feels right for a movie that may not be perfect but nonetheless should be seen.

Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
The novice Scottish feature director Eva Riley delivers a statement debut with this hugely confident coming-of-age drama.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
The movie camera exists for such moments.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
The film's main asset is impressive newcomer Box: veering between bratty backchat and bruised reticence, she's tossed on unpredictable tides of teenage emotions.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
Although the precariousness of her protagonist's situation here points towards a typically British cinematic tale of woe, Riley doesn't give in to those clichés.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
What an emotional, satisfying film this is - and a whopping oversized calling card for everyone involved.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
Debut writer/director Eva Riley has a delicate touch but it's the naturalism of her two fresh leads that make her potentially grim, well-worn underclass drama truly glow.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
Unfussy in its premise and anchored by two impassioned breakout performances, Perfect 10 is an astutely written debut that celebrates a young woman's resilience in the face of grief.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
hugely accomplished and confident
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
Riley never strays far from the well-trodden paths of suburban coming-of-age drama. But what she does do well is to muddy the moral waters, never reaching for easy virtue or sweetness.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
A fresh and endearing coming-of-age film that has an empowering feel.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
Packed with raw, prickly emotion and featuring a terrific debut performance by Frankie Box, writer-director Eva Riley's first feature Perfect 10 is an acutely observed and beautifully shot coming-of-age story.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
Her story is just one amongst many, but isn't any less powerful for being so.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
More than just a story about the comforting nature of kin, it shows how daring it feels to dream when your horizons are so limited.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
Like its characters, Perfect 10 isn't in fact perfect, but it's endearingly rough around the edges.
 "
Perfect 10,100,,critic,"
With Perfect 10, Scottish writer/director Eva Riley turns a plucky and compassionate coming-of-age tale into a memorable feature debut, all while unearthing a shining talent in fellow first-timer Frankie Box.

Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,audience,"An inspirational showing that it doesn't matter how long it takes, but if you have the drive to get somewhere, you'll get there.
 Witty, gritty, and endearing. Amazing to see so many inspired by Moore pay homage to him in this film as Murphy embodies Moore , and I've only known of Dolemite through Hype Williams' choice of interpolated film for his ODB videos - but I know for a fact that homage was paid properly in ""Dolemite Is My Name""."
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,audience,"The most wholesome, foul-mouthed R-rated movie I have ever seen. A thoroughly enjoyable history lesson that warmed my heart moreso than made me laugh, with one notable exception: The scene where Dolemite pitches his movie to the executive who tries to push a feel-good movie on him. Comedy gold. An absolute must-watch for history buffs, film buffs, comedy buffs, and anyone who likes having a good time."
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,audience,"This is a movie that you'd be rooting for the protagonist- doesn't matter how different or unconventional his ways are- much of it perhaps due to Eddie Murphy's likability factor and great acting skills. But this movie will just make you feel good overall- it'll lift up your spirit and be inspired. A big shoutout to Wesley Snipes incredible performance, we all knew he can act but he brought it to superb shocking level!"
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,audience,"This Was The Comeback Of Eddie Murphy. He Should Have Won An Award, Because He Deserve It."
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,audience,"Never mind whether you like or not Eddie Murphy. His performance is stunning, and the characters are just lovable, touching, hilarious..."
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,audience,"Eddie Murphy's so fucking funny. He's still got it, and will forever have it. Oh my god, I already love the aesthetic and feel of it all. Takes me back to the 70's, ya dig? Feel like Eddie wanted to do this role because it reminded him of himself when he was starting out, he understands the struggle of getting yourself out there. Every aspiring artist does. 

Brilliant how he's basically stealing material from the hobo's. Like Picasso said, ""good artists borrow, but great artists steal"". I love how they took the comedy record underground and started selling it independently since the record companies couldn't sell it. Bro Wesley Snipes was really funny.

This movie had me laughing out loud the whole time. The comedic timing and delivery was so good all throughout. This movie proves that what you really need to make it is some grit, a dream, some hustle spirit and the will to never give up. Holy shit, so Rudy Ray Moore practically invented rap in the 70's. I love how they dedicated the movie at the end to Charlie Murphy. RIP. That was a really fun and entertaining movie. Really interesting seeing the inner workings of how a movie is made, even if it was a super low-budget movie."
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,audience,Not even close to 48hrs or Beverly Hills cop. Everyone needs to calm down.
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,audience,Cute but probly not worth your time.
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,audience,A comeback showcase for Eddie Murphy where he has to reign in his natural charisma for the role in tightly directed and packed the the brim with notable actors of color to tell the story of a man that genuinely created his own fame.

The seventies were a creative renaissance for Black Creatives. Black people decided that were done trying to assimilate in Entertainment.
 "
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,critic,"
With Dolemite is My Name, Eddie Murphy is back at full force, honoring both a pioneer who's been lost to time and showing that he still has plenty left in his tank as a performer.
 "
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,critic,"
It has a very nice feel-good sentiment to it...but it felt like a missed opportunity to explore the character further as opposed to focusing solely on the larger-than-life rise to stardom for Rudy Ray Moore.
 "
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,critic,"
Eddie Murphy plays Moore with plenty of heart. It's a live wire performance that brings to life the indefatigable spirit of a guy who thought big.
 "
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,critic,"
There's no flair in the filmmaking itself; the progression of the plot is formulaic and conventional, bounding along with predictable music and montages.
 "

Da'Vine Joy Randolph steals every scene she's in with her natural strength, vulnerability, and grace.

It is a poignant crowdpleaser carried by a dynamic leading performance from Eddie Murphy.
 "

It's a shame the first half is so relentlessly raunchy, because the second half is a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the filmmaking process in Eddie Murphy's nod to blaxploitation.
 "
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,critic,"
The film around him has its flaws, but Murphy's mouth moves so fast that there's never time for the edifice to crumble.
 "

The story of Rudy Ray Moore in a nutshell: It's better to be authentic. And that's a lesson Eddie Murphy seems to have learned, as well.
 "
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,critic,"
Craig Brewer's film similarly romanticises the dream factory that is cinema. So, it is not just a loving tribute to a counterculture-inspired genre but also to the dreamers whose determination and desire far outweighed their skills and knowledge.
 "
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,critic,"
The meta nature of Murphy's casting and the powerhouse performance he delivers in the role is sure to be an awards season narrative.
 "
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,critic,"
The connection between Rudy Ray Moore and Eddie Murphy - both in a fictional and real world perspective - is what makes this a rewarding viewing experience.

Dolemite Is My Name is the kind of delightful film that celebrates the importance of keeping your creative flame alive, no matter how much it feels like your output is unwanted.
 "
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,critic,"
It feels like the ideal fit for Netflix and as long as Murphy wants to chase good roles instead of an easy pay cheque, this should be the start of a late-career revival.
 "
Dolemite Is My Name,97,91,critic,"
One can't pretend that this Dolemite doesn't incorporate clichés, but we also can't deny it's an extremely entertaining exercise...

The Day Shall Come,64,52,audience,"Knowing of Chris Morris from his Brass Eye and seeing him interviewed on the news about this movie I thought I was in for a biting satire about the US security services. The knowledge that it is allegedly based on an absurdly real policy to expose terrorist organisations made it doubly intriguing. However, I found almost everything about be cringeworthy, to the point it is almost unwatchable.
Terrible acting, dreadful, unfunny script and amateurish directing make me marvel that this film even got made. So bad was this movie that by the end, I'd forgotten what it was called and had to look it up in order to leave this review! Avoid at all costs as it is so unfunny and bad it is just plain horrid!"
The Day Shall Come,64,52,audience,"The lack of empathy for an entire family left a bitter taste that overshadowed the comedic satire of the movie. However, I applaud the outstanding performances of the actors."
The Day Shall Come,64,52,audience,"Sharp, biting satire on the absolute mess that American ‘justice’ can be. Marchant Davis is excellent, Anna Kendrick dependably great (plus she wrote left-handed which makes me like her even more)."
The Day Shall Come,64,52,audience,"To be hailed as a comedy is to completely ignore the factual basis for which the scales of the justice system are completely tipped against black and brown individuals. Funny parts peppered throughout a tragic drama does not make this a comedy. It makes it reality that could be funny if it wasn't so terribly true. If you watch this, do not expect to be happy."
The Day Shall Come,64,52,audience,Entertaining dark comedy that reminds me a bit of The Informer. Often funny but somewhat frustrating if you grow to care about the characters.
The Day Shall Come,64,52,audience,"A bitter and brutal travesty of how our (in effect criminal) criminal justice system effectively terrorizes those maligned souls it dubs terrorists, a farce of justice that far too often ends in real tragedy—though here, it's the comedy that shines through (with all praise due to Allah, Melchizedek, Jesus, black Santa, Mohammed, and General Toussaint)."
The Day Shall Come,64,52,audience,"Satires are most powerful when the jokes ring so true that you find yourself laughing at the absurdity of our world and not just the jokes. In this regard, this film soars!"
The Day Shall Come,64,52,audience,This was a very good movie with actors that I really enjoy . 3.8
The Day Shall Come,64,52,audience,"As funny as the first 3/4 of the movie is, it doesn't compare with the gut punch of an ending which reminds you that this ""satire"" is essentially reality now."
The Day Shall Come,64,52,audience,"This was a great movie! Funny, thought-provoking, upsetting, and sad. Real-life U.S. government behavior as satire is dead."
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
...all the preceding comedy falls a bit flat.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
A muddled misfire that lacks the precision-tooled fizz of the director's best work.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
With such talent behind the scenes, it's not that difficult to coast by for a fun time.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
THE DAY SHALL COME presents a character that longs for change. Although the issues are prodded rather than skewered, the film develops a sadness at the absurdity and lack of empathy that perpetuates a status quo with an expensive human cost.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
There are perhaps as many jokes that don't land as those that do, but the sobering finale is good way of reminding us that any humour drilled from this subject can only go on for so long.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
...lacks enough empathy for Moses and his family to create discomfort rather than laughter...The Day Shall Come feels shallow and misguided, without being funny enough to overcome that lack of understanding.
 "

It's a case of distance guiding the film, with little to be gleaned about the intersection of race, economics, and religion.

While foreigners sometimes see a country's flaws better than that country's natives do, that's not the case here.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
One of the best films of 2019, The Day Shall Come is fast-paced and features far wittier dialog than most domestic comedies.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
A convoluted film that is funny but never quite nails its target.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
Witty and surreal, yes, savagely satirical and often chilling, but it's not really rolling-in-the-aisles material.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
With his puppyish, soulful eyes, newcomer Davis unlocks poignancy in his beleaguered sidewalk revolutionary, but the role needed an ebullient wild card, high on his own humbug - a Sacha Baron Cohen or a Tracy Morgan - to really make it fly.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
While I'm all for movies that come in around the 90 minute mark, this simply felt unfinished.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
We understand the implication of the film's point of view but its manipulations along the way to get us there feel too contrived to have real emotional weight.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
Morris, who co-authored the screenplay with Jesse Armstrong, has transformed these fascinating yarns into the first out-and-out dud of his career.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
None of this would pack a punch were it not for the powerful thread of pathos that runs through the drama.
 "
The Day Shall Come,64,52,critic,"
While waiting for Morris' sophomore feature film was a test of patience, I found it was definitely worth it; The Day Shall Come is the auteur at his most unapologetic, and it is a glorious sight to behold.

Babyteeth,94,83,audience,"quirky, heartwarming, great cast, I loved the chapter cuts"
Babyteeth,94,83,audience,"I wasn't sure at first, finding the blossoming relationship to be inappropriate and encouraging me not to trust Moses. The unrealistic dynamics of him and the parents threw me a bit as well. However, I saw past this as the movie progressed and grew to trust him and understand the message being given through the parents' actions. This movie is incredibly deep and moving, with the extremely sad moments somewhat softened by wholesome, relatable humour in between. This movie will stay with me for a long time."

Babyteeth,94,83,audience,"This really threw me, a few misfires early on had me doubting but then suddenly and with magic it all came together and I was completely emotionally engaged and became locked-on to it's powerful message on non-judgement, subjectivity and love, I understood everything, I laughed and I cried and I felt it"

Babyteeth,94,83,audience,An absolute must see.
Babyteeth,94,83,audience,"I think you definitely have to be in the mood for this movie. It's slow and heartfelt, I love the realness of Moses and light of Milla in spite of illness and growing up in a loving but dysfunctional family.  It definitely is an Australian family drama that delves into the modern family unit and lightly touches on class warfare in modern Australia."

Orchestrated with bittersweet notes, this fine Australian coming-of-age drama also takes romance to interesting levels of satisfaction.
 "
Babyteeth,94,83,critic,"
Essie Davis and Ben Mendelsohn give great performances, in particular Mendelsohn's quiet despair in the final scenes.
 "
Babyteeth,94,83,critic,"
Mendelsohn and Davis are old pros, but he hasn't been anything like this good since Mississippi Grind five years ago, and it's hard not to credit this partly to her, a scene partner who's one of the best in the business.
 "
Babyteeth,94,83,critic,"
Intelligently written and very creatively directed, Babyteeth carefully avoids becoming the black comedy or the bleak drama that others telling a similar kind of story might have settled for.
 "
Babyteeth,94,83,critic,"
Babyteeth is authentic and unexpected, thanks to both [director Shannon] Murphy's confident style and the nuanced script from Rita Kalnejais ...

The flawless performances, the colour-drenched and drained polaroid aesthetic, the lightning in a bottle feel in the telling of a cinematic story.

The Dreyfus Affair,77,82,audience,"A didactic representation of the hate that soon would have reign over Europe. A careful attention to the historic details, together with an incredible performance by the actors, makes this movie a masterpiece."
The Dreyfus Affair,77,82,audience,"A film featuring talented actors (Jean Dujardin's acting is superb, I believe) as well as impressive and convincing scenes of 19th century France, but unfortunately lacks an interesting cinematic narration and becomes quite dull and boring."
The Dreyfus Affair,77,82,audience,"The films score was boring, the sets too clean, and the cuts, with a few exceptions, also boring, and contributing nothing to the movie. Some of the props seemed already worn as though they where antiques even though of course they shouldn't have been at the time the film portrays. the choreography of the few fight scenes in the film came off as inauthentic and poorly acted. This was my first Roman Polanski film, I went in with high expectations, I didn't feel much of anything while watching it."
The Dreyfus Affair,77,82,audience,"Tan interesante el tema como aburrida la película. El caso Dreyfus fue de suprema importancia para la justicia francesa, un atroz caso de antisemitismo en el interior del ejército francés, que conllevo a varios arrestos injustos. Por fortuna el coronel Georges Picquart y, más tarde, el escritor Émile Zola, con su artículo ""J'accuse"" lograron que se abriera el campo para aclarar el delito cometido en contra de Alfred Dreyfus. La película se hace lenta y ladrilluda, el guion no es bueno y los personajes carecen de pasión. Se vuelve tediosa y somnífera."
The Dreyfus Affair,77,82,audience,"It is indeed a masterwork and an excellent technical achievement. One can even say it's mathematically accurate in all the departments of moviemaking: such perfection can only be achieved by such experience which Polanski posseses. It's done so well, that even its story, trivial as it is, albeit important to tell, and which in other hands  would probably end up being quite boring, is told with admirable suspense and is interesting to follow, even though it's very predictable, even to those who might not know the historical story."
The Dreyfus Affair,77,82,audience,Sterling return to form
The Dreyfus Affair,77,82,audience,"good all around movie about the famous dreyfous affair,the story of a military man falsely accused of treason mainly because he was a jew.tight script lead to claustrophobic bureaucratic atmopshere,production design perfectly captures the time,2 hours and 12 minutes flying by quickly as you are immediately absorbed by the hypocrisy and corruption of a pretty much whole nation.dark times for france..great cast led by the charismatic jean dujardin,in a seriously straight no-bulls..it performance worthy of an academy award nomination.winner of many cesars the movie was immediately controversial mainly because of its director roman polanski.still seeking us distribution,my opinion its not going to happen.and it's a shame,it's a pretty good movie,could have been big in us awards."

Effortlessly absorbing procedural cinema: With its proliferation of intercepted documents and carefully scrutinized handwriting samples, it opens an engrossing window on the top-secret workings of 19th century French intelligence.

The Painted Bird,82,61,audience,"I read ""The Painted Bird"" 50 years ago and found the reading difficult but ehard to put down. The memories of the book haunted me for years. I later read reviews by critics who accused Kosinski of plagiarizing or inventing his material. Perhaps I had been duped into reading something I should not. 

One of the lines of critique engages in the notion that the book--and the movie--are depictions of Nazi Germany. Indeed, the critics say, the scenes did not take place in Germany. The Germans played a small role. It's therefore not a good movie about the Holocaust. 

But that's wrong. The greatest excesses of the Holocaust did in fact occur outside of Germany in Eastern Europe. Even German Jews, and for that matter Dutch and French Jews, were deported into Eastern Europe to be murdered. 

The story line of the Painted Bird is almost certainly apocryphal, a work of fiction, not a documentary.  Like all fiction, it draws its material from human nature. The various depictions of ugliness provided in the book--and in the movie--might never have been witnessed by any one person, and a few might not have actually ever occurred, and only been invented in the  imaginations of twisted people. But the fact remains the stories are there, the notions of depravity are there.  And the fact remains that in Eastern Europe in the 1940s a massive amount of unspeakable, depraved cruelty happened. 

The movie almost perfectly captures Kozinski's story. One can argue whether the story itself should have been told, for the reasons I mentioned above. I believe that it is an important story, not as a document of historical detail, but as a document of human ignorance and cruelty. If we fail to understand that ignorance and cruelty were at the core of the depravity that enveloped Eastern Europe, we have missed not only what happened, but are inviting it to happen again."
The Painted Bird,82,61,audience,"I could barely get through the first half hour, it's too graphic and mean for my tastes"
The Painted Bird,82,61,audience,"Václav Marhoul made a film and it's pretty graphic and it just doesn't work.  Marhoul produced, wrote and directed 'The Painted Bird' based on the novel and, well, you be the judge.  It was never boring, but more in the way people rubberneck at an accident cleared off to the side of the highway than anything else.  It's a herculean task to get grasp of everything Marhoul is attempting to do and that overambitious effort leads to a miss.  Is it art?  Is it exploitative? Maybe some of column A and some of column B.  Final Score: 5.0/10"
The Painted Bird,82,61,audience,"From the opening scene to the very end, I cried. This is not an easy film to watch, I had to cover my eyes at times as a seemly endless parade of human cruelty, inhumanity and depravity marched by; but at the same time, it was touching and beautiful. Beautifully written, acted, filmed and directed. It’s a courageous movie and a testament to the endurance of the human spirit amid almost unimaginable suffering. It leaves you pondering the human condition and the blindness of hatred and prejudice—literally."
The Painted Bird,82,61,audience,"Normally I'm all for these types of movies, the really explicit films trying to make a point with artistic merit, challenging their audiencing, and I enjoy and defend these films... but yhis one doesn't have many redeeming values. The critics lie when they say it has emotional impact, it's more of a numbing sensation from being on the other end of a punch-drunk wrestler who just got his life ruined right before his eyes. The movie opens with a sequence of shocking animal cruelty -- points to the film for shock value, creativity, originality, and uses of quietness and minimalism by the way -- and from there it's just 3 hours of scene-after-scene unpleasantness. It's not entertaining, it KIND OF gets a reaction out of you, but it doesn't leave you emotionally compelled just turned off because there's no significance to what you're seeing for either character development, plot, or atmosphere. It's just unpleasant, miserable cruelty for the sake of exploitation and I think it's trying to have a message but it lost what it was in the process, because nothing seems to really correlate other than ""let's abuse the little boy on-screen as brutally as possible as many times as possible"" and I'm not sure what the point of it all was. There wasn't really a plot, just being passed to different acclaimed actors (Harvey Keitel, Udo Kier, and Stellan Skarsgard) who made me interested in the movie in the first place along with the acclaim. It was more horrific than any horror movie I'd seen despite being labeled a drama. The uncompromisingly bleak visuals do have a sad, memorable beauty to them when something inexcusable isn't happening. There's NC-17 movies I found less unpleasant than this one. Just not a good time in the slightest. It sounds terrible without context, but other war dramas, WWII movies like Schindler's List are at least enjoyable. They're a bit sad, but it's necessary. What scene in this movie feels necessary to the whole? There's no cohesion! Maybe it's my fault for watching an Udo Kier and Stellan Skarsgard movie, like I should've expected Lars Von Trier, but I just wasn't prepared for arthouse horror tonight. I usually love those movies, but those I knew what I was getting into and I never got bored."
The Painted Bird,82,61,audience,"You have to be up for a dark and stark picture that describes much of the human condition.  But if you are up for it, this is a well made and acted film."
The Painted Bird,82,61,audience,"The Painted Bird, based on the bleak-as-all-hell-not-at-all-biographical novel of the same name, is close to 3 hours of a young boy wandering around a continent torn apart by war and, it would seem, 18th century superstition. I picked up the book in 2014 and it was a very compelling read. The horrors it describes are savage and unrelenting, and it doesn't have many moments of levity. It also isn't very long. The movie adaptation is almost 170 minutes, and while it fits in plenty of violence, there's also an absurd amount of downtime. The book was well-paced and always had something going on, but the film often drags its heels, with characters standing around staring at nothing in particular or walking slowly around. It's like the film keeps getting interrupted by an annoying arthouse flick, and you find yourself actually anticipating the violence just to alleviate the tedium, something you didn't get with the book. It's got some fairly big name, but most of the actors you'll recognise have little more than cameos, with the great Stellan Skarsgård not even getting a single word of dialogue. It's a weird combination of Eli Roth torture porn and Terrence Malick arthouse pretentions. Its bloated length is compounded by its languid pacing, and had about an hour been cut out, which is very doable, it would have been an easier watch. I admire the talent and effort which went into it, and when it wants you to sit up and take notice, you always do. Not for the faint of heart, or those with less than 3 hours to kill, but it's a noble effort nonetheless."
The Painted Bird,82,61,audience,"Amazing movie --- heartbreaking, thought-provoking, emotional, and tear jerker.... all the feelings I love from an epic movie like this..."
The Painted Bird,82,61,audience,Amazing bleak and poignant 
The Painted Bird,82,61,audience,"A few months ago, I reviewed Come And See, a masterful 1985 film which followed a young Soviet boy through the horrors of life during World War II.   Clearly influenced by Jerzy Kosinki's  indelible yet discredited 1965 autobiography, the plot centered around a young Eastern European Jewish boy wandering from town to town towards the end of World War II and experiencing one atrocity after another.  The story may or may not have been true, or perhaps plagiarized or based on someone else's life, but the concept proved unforgettable. Finally brought to the screen by Václav Marhoul, this nearly three hour black and white film may lack the experimentation and cacophony of sound from Come And See, but it possesses gorgeous cinematography, a fantastic central performance, and an intimacy which will punch you in the gut over and over again.  

Told in nine chapters named after the people he encounters, The Painted Bird follows a young boy whose parents have left him in the care of a stern but kind elderly relative.  When she dies suddenly, the boy accidentally burns down their rural house and wanders aimlessly from one unnamed town to the next.  As he encounters bigoted villagers, Nazis, sadists, abusers, pedophiles and more, we don't so much see a child lose his innocence as we bear witness to an already benumbed survivor making one tough, soul-changing decision after another.  Marhoul reportedly discovered Petr Kotlár in one of the towns he scouted for the production, and he gives a quiet, observant, stoic performance and does so with almost no dialogue.  Shot over a two year period, one can see the difference in age and body shape from time to time, but his commitment to the role remains hugely impressive. He reminded me of Tatum O'Neal in Paper Moon, in that you believed in his strength and his ability to convey his ever-hardening thoughts. 

Marhoul laces the film with many brief but memorable star cameos, most likely to boost international sales.  Udo Kier and Julian Sands make the biggest impressions as two men wrongly entrusted to care for the boy at different times.  Alexsey Kravchenko, who played the young man in Come And See, also appears as a Soviet military officer, clearly passing the torch on to Petr Kotlár.  Although mostly kept offscreen, the film's brutality will likely overwhelm most viewers.  Its stifling, repetitive qualities aim more to keep a record of the terrors millions of people experienced at the time rather than to entertain.  If you're seeking some light entertainment, look elsewhere.  This film evokes words like grueling, harrowing, and uncompromising.  

Having said that, The Painted Bird never bored me.  It's grand visuals, courtesy of cinematographer Vladimír Smutný, reminded me of those in Roma.  The framing keeps you off balance and in the shoes of our young protagonist but also serves to convey the scope and scale of the harshness.  One sequence, in which a trainload of Jews attempt to escape from a moving train will stay with me for a long time.  I also appreciated the many setups and payoffs in a film which may feel episodic yet actually builds towards something.  The vastness and stark beauty of the landscapes may look awe-inspiring but feel more hopeless and daunting from the point of view of our main character.  

Come And See left me without a shred of hope for humanity, whereas The Painted Bird, whose title refers to a young bird torn apart by a flock because of its differences to them, ends with just the tiniest bit of levity.  We continue to feel the impact of the Holocaust to this day with ever-growing and ever-emboldened hatred of others getting permission to do so from our so-called leaders.  We also navigate the trauma, often left unexamined, in the people who suffered at the hands of monsters. I never want to see The Painted Bird again, but I don't really have to, as I will never forget it."

The Laundromat,41,40,audience,"I didn't enjoy this at all, yet I still weirdly reflect on it to be better than it had any right to be.

That's thanks to the cast of 'The Laundromat'. Meryl Streep (Ellen), Gary Oldman (Mossack) and Antonio Banderas (Fonseca) are the main reasons I'm not rating this lower. They stop it becoming an annoying watch. You also have Jeffrey Wright, David Schwimmer and Nonso Anozie involved too - as well as even Sharon Stone and James Cromwell.

I just didn't like the way they chose to portray everything, I appreciate what they went for but it simply didn't work for me. It's definitely one of those things, though, that will depend on the viewer - I'm sure many will find it good.

The comedy is extremely lacking, in accordance to my tastes anyway. Also, even though I praised Oldman and Banderas themselves, I found their characters particularly irritating - same goes with the ending.

Feels like it merits an inferior score and yet... A charitable 2*."
The Laundromat,41,40,audience,"The Laundromat gets off to a fine start as a film on a mission to expose large-scale insurance fraud with a balance of light-heartedness and black comedy. No matter how experienced or entertaining the three lead veterans are, the script does them no favours by skipping around situations and chapters that eventually leave the story without a core anchor. It just devolves into a repetitive, sporadically fun cycle."
The Laundromat,41,40,audience,one star for Meryl Streep...
The Laundromat,41,40,audience,"A scattershot movie in which the director can't make up his mind over which bad direction the film should move, so he chooses all of them. Supposedly about the Panama Papers, the film spends most of its time trying to explain the concept of money to the viewer (who has paid to see the film, and so understands the concept of money by default) and largely ignores the subject matter entirely. Ultimately, this is a film about nothing into which no serious work or thought seems to have been expended."
The Laundromat,41,40,audience,"So as a physician I think most movies and tv shows about medicine are absurd, so I’m sure many financial experts feel that this movie was an oversimplification of a much more complicated event; HOWEVER, as a relative financial simpleton I found this movie HIGHLY entertaining, and it actually taught me a thing or too about shell companies. I may even reconsider some of my discount insurance policies😉."
The Laundromat,41,40,audience,What a waste of time.  Thank God we had the sense to stop it halfway through.  Terrible.
The Laundromat,41,40,audience,"This was bad.  So very bad.  It tried hard to be The Big Short, but it failed miserably.  I would have given a full one-star, but I deducted down to half a star for Streep's preaching at the end.  I was very disappointed in it given all of the decent performers.  Soderbergh has made good movies, and he''s whiffed on a few too.  This was a big whiff."
The Laundromat,41,40,audience,just watched this on Netflix. didn't stop-pause once for refreshment or trip to the loo.
The Laundromat,41,40,audience,This movie definitely deserves more credit and better score than it's getting. It's as good as The BIg Short and as confusing as well. They had  a very unique way of explaining how fucked up the whole system is and how concealed under many many layers the whole financial system is.
The Laundromat,41,40,audience,"This is nothing more than a disjointed sermon (concluded by an actual sermon) from people who have no clue about why tax breaks exist and how providing tax breaks results in more tax revenue. Even worse, they don't understand the difference between tax fraud and legal (and encouraged) tax mitigation. It's embarrassing."

It's all kinds of unnecessarily weird and tasteless and exploitative and way, way, way too blunt and shrill.

The King,71,83,audience,"Reimagining Falstaff is an interesting idea, and Falstaff's character is excellent.  But the rest of this is rubbish.  The battle scene at Agincourt is laughably bad.  (Casting a 98 lb weakling as a warrior did not help, despite his acting skills.) The epilog with the French princess is just pathetic... steals whatever drama the film might have ended with and turns it into a daytime soap."
The King,71,83,audience,"This movie is an insulte to history or to any fictional play written by Shakespeare.
For some reason Henry V was depicted as an peace loving hippy who unwillingly became King of England because of ""reasons"" while trying to stay at peace with the King of France or the Dauphin, Louis de Guyenne, horribly portrayed by that dude which played a vampire that would become bright under the sun in Twilight. I mean really? Wasn't the whole point of the hundred years war was the claim by the Plantagenet dynasty to the French Crown? Really, Henry the fifth historically hated the French! At this point the movie is basically just french bashing. Oh yeah, we are claiming the crown of France but that's because for some reasons you send assassins (Really!?!?) to kill us!!! 
 I really don't get why, the Dauphin, which by the way, wasn't at Azincourt and clearly didn't die at the hand of Henry the fifth although at this point, who cares was portrayed with this horrible fake-french accent; let's be honest, the anglo-normand aristocrates didn't speak English but French and they should have been portrayed with a similar accent... but heh, Hollywood... 
By the way, there is no tabard in this movie; WHY!? This is how noble would recognise each other's on the battlefield.
Also, at the time, there wasn't any notion of French and English; Nationalism is the result of the hundred year's war, not the cause. 
There is one redeeming quality to this movie and it's a 40 sec duel that happen at the beginning of the movie which actually is a realistic depiction of European martial art. I mean, there is so many bad note to this movie that I cannot write a fluid review. I'm just angry at this piece of crap. 
Also, couldn't they have opened a map of Azincourt and research the order of battle before filming this horrible scene?
 Whomever gave a good review to this movie is an ignorant dumbass­"

As a viewer, it's incredible to see the rise of this king and see him become ruthless. Every time I watch this I hope that Timothee Chalamet makes different choices but it is still amazing every time. I think this movie really rides the balance of humor and drama. Especially in the beginning and with Robert Pattinson's character. I think this movie is a masterpiece and everyone should watch this movie at least once."

Very Taxi Driver-esque and De Niro slides comfortably into his Rupert Pupkin character from THE KING OF COMEDY. I'm glad this film really shined a light on mental health and hopefully this can bring further discussion to the conversation. I'll admit I was apprehensive when the film was first announced but the cast and crew knocked it out of the park. I'm hoping some Oscars are in their future, especially for Phoenix!"
Joker,68,88,audience,Exceptional! Fantastic performance by Phoenix!
Joker,68,88,audience,"The film is good. Not worth all the fuss to be quite honest, but very good nonetheless. The story however felt empty, probably because of how ambitious the director Todd Phillips wanted to be. It was definitely a washed down version of 'Taxi Driver' Not so much the 'King of Comedy', it definitely drew some inspiration from it but it had its own little thing going on. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was stupendous he really made that role his own, I was awestruck from beginning to end. Do I recommend watching the film in theatres? Absolutely, not because of the story and or plot, it was intriguing don't get me wrong. However I recommend the film because of Joaquin Phoenix's performane as the clown prince of crime, The Joker. And the magnificent cinematography, every shot was absolutely striking! Too good not to be seen on the big screen."
Joker,68,88,audience,"Absolutely jaw dropping performance from Joaquin Phoenix. His Joker is unsettling, uncomfortable, sympathetic, impulsive, likeable, and reclusive...all at once.

I typically don't even care for movies that are ultimately character driven over story driven, but Joker broke me of that very quickly. This isn't to say that the story is secondary though. This was an enthralling origin story for one of media's favorite villains."
Joker,68,88,audience,"Surprising, amazing, serious, inspiring, the phenomenal performances. The issue of how society moves away from problems and decides to ignore them instead of recognizing that they exist and how they can solve them, but prefers to look the other way and do that it is not with them and in the future others will have to solve it."
Joker,68,88,audience,"The best movie I have seen in a long time. I usually can't even stay focused for a fully anymore, but this one had my full attention from start to finish."
Joker,68,88,audience,"Esse filme é brilhante, as vezes da um tédio de leve mas ainda sim consegue ser um bom filme."
Joker,68,88,critic,"
Although it has some of the hallmarks of a mainstream movie, there's little that's entertaining about Joker. Phoenix's version of the character is uncomfortable, and his off-putting nature will likely not inspire many repeat viewings.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
A male rage manifesto with ugly societal truths.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
It may not be a deep or realistic study of mental illness but it showcases Arthur's weariness at being treated as the cigarette butt under society's heel.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
Joker is nothing more than a shallow homunculus of better films.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
Phoenix gives the performance of his career, one already filled with admirable, transformative performances. But this one is different. This one is his cry for Oscar gold, and the masses will surely be chanting his name and singing his praises on high.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
... this is an R-rated origin story for one of the most deranged, murderous villains in fiction, and the film reflects that. It may not make you feel good, but it will make you feel something, and sometimes that's enough.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
Surely the most realistic depiction of a supervillain becoming a supervillain thus far.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
Joker is a subversion of the trope of the hero's journey, made for a villain.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
Without Mr. Phoenix, Joker would be kind of dull.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
Joker is repulsive, cynical garbage that tries acting more meaningful than it actually is.

Repellent and pitiful at the same time, Phoenix is absolutely riveting.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
Phillips constructs a palpable sense of down-and-dirty dread, helped by Phoenix's commitment ... but the movie stops short of ever expressing an opinion.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
The curveballs that Joker will throw at you stay in your head for hours afterwards, as does the haunting collapse of its protagonist.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
It all reminds me of a Goth teenager: He dresses in black, circles his eyes with mascara and mopes around in his room, all the time with no idea what he's so depressed about.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
Don't expect a Marvel action flick for kids. This is a gritty character study, one where fans and critics can all agree on one thing: Joaquin Phoenix could laugh all the way to the Oscars.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
Undeniably compelling.
 "
Joker,68,88,critic,"
While drawing heavy influence from previous Scorsese movies, Joker boasts a great performance from Phoenix and shows that darker comic book films continue to have a place in a family-oriented realm.

Ad Astra,83,40,audience,"Although I am a huge space nerd and I wanted to like this movie...I did not.  I did enjoy the scenery and special effects, but the plot (holes) were the big problem for me.  SPOLIERS ahead- I understand that it's a movie and it doesn't need to be perfectly believable for me to like it, but you gotta give me some details so I can TRY to believe in what the story is about.  Maybe I'm too analytical, but it was the mission details (or lack there of) that left me scratching my head the whole movie.  A 2 minute conversation in the beginning, that is horribly vague on details, is supposed tell us what the entire movie is about.  What exactly are these surges? How is the father making these surges happen?  WHY is he making them happen? Does he know that he is hurting people on Earth?  Is he trying to kill the people on Earth?  If so, why?  And the big one for me.....if he is creating these surges using anti-matter, then wouldn't blowing up his ship (that has all of the anti-matter) with a nuclear bomb just going to create the biggest surge and wipe out everyone on Earth???  And if you are told that your father is out there and making these surges happen, how could you not ask a few more questions?  Give me DIALOGUE!  And even though I endured to the end of the movie and I was hoping for that dialogue when he finally faced his father, I was again very disappointed.  ""Hey Dad, let's go.""  C'mon man, give me more than that!  Oh, and they couldn't find his father with all of those drones they sent to look for him....He was right there....right next to Neptune....Brad went right to his ship....didn't even need to look.  And lastly, when Brad made it back to Earth and they opened the hatch to his ship, I wasn't sure if they were going to hail him as a hero, or arrest him!  In a space story like this, you need to let the viewer know what you want us to believe.  We are smart enough to know what is real, can actually happen, and if the physics hold up.....but if you give us enough details of what you want us to believe, we can put that other stuff to the side.  Interstellar did a better job of this.  That movie was not believable, from a ""real life"" point of view, but the movie gave us enough to just go with it and say ""hey, it's just a movie and it was a cool idea"".  Ad Astra failed on this front.  They had a cool idea to run with, and they failed.  And like many other views have noted, just because a movie has cool special effects, doesn't mean it will be a good movie.  When you have a good idea, good special effects, a good cast, and you fail to tell the story right, it makes the viewer feel even worse about the movie."
Ad Astra,83,40,audience,"Brad Pitt is sent on a mission to Mars to try to communicate to his (believe to be dead) father, played by Tommy Lee Jones, who is on Neptune looking for other intelligent life forms. While visually this movie has some stunning shots, overall, it's a very dry and dull movie with mediocre performances by all involved. Pitt probably has the strongest performance but his character is so detached and non-emotional, I question how much of a stretch it was to pull off. If you have any interest in seeing this, I advise on passing."
Ad Astra,83,40,audience,"Horrible.  Long drawn out pointless movie.  You will get nothing out of watching this please don't waste your time or money on this.  I love Tommy Lee and Brad Pitt but not even they could save this boring, pointless movie."
Ad Astra,83,40,audience,"James Gray seems to forever be burdened by the question: ""Can one truly escape his genetic legacy and become his own self?"" and in his 2019 space exploration drama he attempts to answer the question with both gravitas and grace.

Ad Astra, latin for 'To the Stars', happens in the near future, in a moment where we finally got the tools to properly explore our Solar System beyond the moon and into the exciting unknown. So humanity's main interest is finding extra-terrestrial life. We follow Brad Pitt's Roy McBride, an astronaut forever marked by his father's disappearance some 20 years prior while exploring Neptune, the farthest place humanity has ever reached. His father (Tommy Lee Jones) is both a hero and a martyr for mankind, but for Roy he's ultimately just the father who left, so he becomes a man of great focus and self-control, but also a man who doesn't know what to do with his emotions, so he bottles them, both consciously and fearfully. He might just be the definition of the old clichee ""every man is an island"".

So when Roy finally gets a ray of hope that his father may be alive and is sent on a mission to Mars to assist the operation, he jumps right at the opportunity, enthusiastic and reluctant at the same time. What follows is an amazing, voice-over heavy journey through space, as visually arresting as it is introspective, as morally complex and it is revelatory. Space here, unlike inside other sci-fi films, seems to be almost 'close' to us. Gray somehow makes this kind of exploration seem achievable, yet remote and cold. We can feel the taciturn Moon, the merciless Mars and the glacial Neptune in our bones, almost like we want them but they don't want us. Like the most distant kind of father.

Brad Pitt really shines as Roy. Ironically, Pitt, an actor known for his predominantly physical roles and his proficiency in showing emotion through ample movement of his body (Snatch, Fight Club, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and so on) makes one of his best performances in maybe his most restrained character. Roy is a man of many thoughts, but of few words, cool and controller in his demeanor and often restricted by his space suits, yet Pitt slowly and gently reveals more and more layers of this fascinating character completely out of sync with who he is.

Some of the film, especially the last act, gets a little too self-explanatory: too much voice-over, too many lines saying the same thing. Gray should have let his beautiful shots do all the talking and some characters could have been explored much more than they were. Still, there very much to be admired here, especially when you realize that Ad Astra is a modern, thematically updated rendition of a certain classic 70's movie (you will realize which one sooner or later, I won't spoil it for you). Is it the best space movie of the 2010s? Probably not, but it is highly spectacular nonetheless."
Ad Astra,83,40,audience,"beautifully filmed (albeit mostly CGI), great acting by Brad Pitt, would liked to have seen more of Tommy Lee Jones. younger audiences might not be appreciate the pace of the film... I felt it went perfectly with the environment."
Ad Astra,83,40,audience,"This movie had the quality and pacing of something that should only be seen on late night sci-fi channel with informercials, which is a shame for Tommy Lee Jones. I'm genuinely sad this poorly written and edited garbage was the last thing I got to see with my family before the covid closures."
Ad Astra,83,40,audience,Boooooooooooooooring
Ad Astra,83,40,audience,"So this was disappointing as I usually love Brad Pitt and this was a movie I wanted to see in theaters but just missed. But the movie was just boring, too complicated for reason, and pointless. Some of the special effects were good, but the how somethings happened is just dumb. It could have been better if they would have focused the story and not added a bunch of other extra stuff."
Ad Astra,83,40,audience,"The movie is in general a good space Sci-fi, but it becomes innecessary complicated and sometimes too slow. Definitely it's not at the Interestellar level (and less scientifically accurate), but you could have a good time watching it."
Ad Astra,83,40,audience,"Great actors and visuals in service of a total waste of a story.  The central storyline is the relationship between a son and a father but it brings nothing new to that story and is uninteresting.  Both the story and the relationships just feel like collections of tropes.  The only relationship that totally felt real to me was that between the protagonist and the Mars base commander.  And if the great acting and realistic visuals make you start to care about the relationships, that is sabotaged by the Warner Bros cartoony fakeness of the world in the movie.  This feels like a Disney Teen movie from decades ago that has been dressed up for adults.  What a waste.

Here's just a few non-spoilery fails:

The threat that propels the plot is not believable.

The movie confuses the search for intelligent life with that for any life on other planets.  Nor does it make any sense why that project would succeed or fail in the context of the movie.

It feels like the characters have no agency in the story due to how plot hammered they are."
Ad Astra,83,40,critic,"
Ad Astra is an extraordinary film that contains a vision for the future that's both appealing and cautionary, as well as a technical wizardry that makes our solar system feel reachable and wondrous at the same time.
 "
Ad Astra,83,40,critic,"
It certainly has something to say. I just wish it hadn't said it so very loudly.
 "
Ad Astra,83,40,critic,"
Given the effectiveness of Gray's more genre-y moments ,his insistence on paring his stories down to a kind of quietly masculine anguish feels perverse.
 "
Ad Astra,83,40,critic,"
Pitt, in a largely non-verbal performance save for copious voiceover, shows his emotions through the cracks, allowing the character to reveal himself in the contemplative but compellingly unsettling way.
 "

A powerful meditation on fathers, sons, and masculinity, Ad Astra profoundly deconstructs a traditional character archetype with a deft hand.
 "
Ad Astra,83,40,critic,"
It's awfully cautious and plodding, regularly amplifying the wonder and the mystery, but letting down with its revelations.
 "

The equivalent of a painter completing their masterpiece by punching a fist through it.

Ad Astra,83,40,critic,"
Pitt's wicked combination of movie star allure and acting talent make you buy into this gripping father-son space drama, which marches to the beat of its own drum.
 "
Ad Astra,83,40,critic,"
Ad Astra is more a father son story wrapped up in an existential exercise than it is any traditional sic-fi film.
 "
Ad Astra,83,40,critic,"
A seamless mood piece about loneliness, colonization, and fatherhood and ranks highly among the current onslaught of space movies.

This should feel like a thrill ride IN SPACE, not like an actual 3-day trip to the moon where you wish the pulmonary embolisms developing in your legs would kill you.

One of the difficulties is that Ad Astra is a space movie with a fundamental lack of interest in what's out there, in the form of intelligent life or otherwise.

After 11 years on the road, Schumer's hot-mess routine is well honed, but this showcase is only intermittently special.

 "
Amy Schumer: Live From the Apollo,90,16,critic,"
Live at the Apollo is her funniest and most thoughtful stand-up yet, but it proves she still has room to grow as a comedian, if she doesn't devote herself to movies full-time.

What the special drove home for me is that while Amy Schumer is wonderful at stand-up, it's not even the best thing she does.

The result is that her comedy seems effortless, and properly authentic.

Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,85,70,audience,I have watched this movie over and over!!  One of my favorites! Everything about it is amazing.  If you are a true Tarantino fan then you will not be disappointed. See for yourself!
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,85,70,audience,"While not the most action-packed Tarantino film of his 9-film franchise so far and slow/boring in many parts, still of course awesome acting from Leonardo DiCaprio, Bruce Dern, and Brad Pitt. And to top it off narration from Kurt Russell of all people! Bruce Lee's portrayal was also sub-par at best."
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,85,70,audience,"My most eagerly anticipated movie of the year and I was a little disappointed with it. Not Tarantino's best but far from his worse either. The soundtrack wasn't as catchy overall (still had some gems but from top-to-bottom his soundtracks are usually top notch). Leo absolutely stole the show and continues to show why he's one of the finest actors working today. Brad did an excellent job complimenting him as well and their screen time together at times made the movie. Margot was a delicate flower throughout and was glad Tarantino humanized her. Unfortunately, due to the nature of her death she's viewed as a victim whereas this role gave her life. A very beautiful love letter by Quentin to the Hollywood of yesteryear. I'll check it out in theaters again!"
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,85,70,audience,Very well done.  Very entertaining.  Awesome storyline.
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,85,70,audience,"Only reason I give this a star is because the Bruce lee scene is hysterical.  The 
AST two minutes is alright but the rest of the movie is extremely boring and I mean almost unbearably boring.  Recommend either watching in a form you can fast forward or not watching."
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,85,70,audience,this is the first Tarantino film I've ever seen so it's quite different. I still really like it with DiCaprio and Pitt giving extraordinary performances.
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,85,70,audience,"Wow!!! The first time I watched this film, I laughed all the way through. The dialogue is hilarious, the situations are hysterical. The great fantastic phenomenal movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. Sometimes you may feel that the movie is too long. But as you keep watching, the feeling of the movie is faster than you can imagine. Some scenes, I won't say which ones but they get brutal and kind like suspenseful and how the music sounds. Feel like you're in a horror movie which is weird but then you also feel like you're in a comedy then go to a drama. It's has everything feeling and has lots of fantastic scene. This movie has a ton of great actors that give a performance of a lifetime especially Brad Pitt. He's so enjoyable and also entertaining. In my opinion, he is better than Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie although Leo is in the movie more. But Brad Pitt's moments stand out more and more memorable. Margot Robbie to me felt like she having a role that is less attractive in the movie. I thought the movie would tie the three main characters together but they never did disappointing for me. (Spoiler alert!) The ending of the movie made me a little confused but Quentin Tarantino knows what he's doing and it's supposed to mean something so I'm intrigued. Overall, the movie is really good, it's fun, and there are a lot of feelings that make it perfect. This is definitely a great film and it is my second favorite Brad Pitt film of all time."
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,85,70,audience,Nothing actually even happened in this movie. It's weird. And is Sharon Tate supposed to be pregnant here or what?
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,85,70,audience,A story about an actor and his stunt-double that slowly unwinds into something much more sinister.
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,85,70,audience,"A relaxed Brad Pitt is akin to a cinematic massage. I liked Leo's scene with the child actor and Margot Robbie's scene in the theater. But overall, I felt quite bored with the two leads, whose time has passed both in their world and in mine. I just don't need stories about culturally expiring white men like this anymore, particularly when QT adds nothing new beyond his cinematic and physical fetishes (both also more fun in better movies)."

Diego Maradona,90,,audience,"A compelling documentary. Really shows the adoration of the man himself and the power that football has to shift the mindset of the community. The film focuses mostly on his time at Napoli and I had very little Idea about what happened when they signed him. Certainly worth a watch.

It would have been better to also focus on Boca where he spent most of his career in. Anyway 10/10, great film."
Diego Maradona,90,,audience,"It's possible to argue that Diego Maradona was football's first global celebrity; where you place him in the top 5 male players of all time is perhaps not relevant to that. His emergence as a great, moving from Argentina to become a dominant European force and driving his country to World Cup success, went hand in hand with being one of the very first footballers to achieve the sort of fame which is now such a feature of the sporting landscape. Celebrity  - its pitfalls and its effects on the person themselves - was also the focus of writer-director Asif Kapadia's outstanding film on Amy Winehouse, and it's fitting that it's also the theme of this film on the great Argentian footballer. 

We follow  - in significant detail - his career from its early days, skipping over his brief and less successful stint in Spain, and home in on his days in Naples. It's here he found his peak as a player; it's here that his fame ascended to previously unheard-of levels; it's here that he ended up broken. In doing so his addiction to cocaine is the focus of the second half the film and alongside that the way he became owned more by organised crime than he was by his employers. 

In terms of his relationships, the film gives less away. We do hear from sisters and his mother; the relationship with the woman who bore his son whom he only acknowledged late in life is given little time, and the same is true of what has been reported elsewhere of his poor treatment of women. It may be that this is seen as less essential to the study of celebrity as a phenomena, but it also feels a little troubling. 

The rest of the film is often thrilling or moving. Watching footage of his genius is always something to behold; there is little room left to doubt just how special a talent he was. And his final descent, which is really only briefly addressed as the film comes to a close, is no less moving for it; in fact, its brevity may be the point. It's almost as if giving little screen-time to that later part of his story, Kapadia is saying something about the toxic cost of celebrity, and what happens to a person who becomes something different to what those who idolise him demand. The film as a whole skilfully unpacks the difference the man himself spoke of between the two parts of his persona; Diego, the boy from Argentina who just wanted to play and Maradona, the man who carried a world on his shoulders and ultimately found it too heavy to carry. As such, the film marks a valuable entry into what needs to be a growing understanding of what celebrity culture is and does; watched alongside the Amy Winehouse film (Amy), there is much to think on here."
Diego Maradona,90,,audience,A must watch for any football fan & a great film in general. The archive footage is brilliant and this film truly depicts what Diego had to go through in becoming the greatest footballer of our time. 5/5.
Diego Maradona,90,,audience,This is the documentary that best exposes the difference between Diego and Maradona and subtly explains how the character ate the best player in the world.
Diego Maradona,90,,audience,"Kicked, battered, bruised, high, snorting, booed, reviled, worshipped, smothered and enveloped he comes through. Wearing the coolest footy kits ever made, the greatest player of them all, the people's champion, just about triumphs. Marvellous documentary of a different time: you can't imagine national tv would ask girls which Napoli player they would sleep with, pant laden champagne flowing dressing rooms, seatless stands. You know it matters more when a five foot nothing guy gets his hand to the ball before a six foot four Peter Shilton."

Diego Maradona,90,,audience,"Diego Maradona is the best documentary film that brings the truth of Maradona's career, family, and life."
Diego Maradona,90,,audience,"An amazing insight into the life & decline of the genius that was Diego Armando Maradona & his time in Naples for where he was herald a god by supporters, but his association with the mob & cocain made him a prisoner & unable to leave with the scandals that followed."
Diego Maradona,90,,audience,He had it all and did it all one of the most charismatic emotional passionate and real footballers you'll ever see. In a team sport to witness someone single handedly win titles with an average argentina and napoli is simply incredible. This movie captures his highs and lows of his career and you see how damaging such god like fame can be to anyone regardless of money and talent were all human and we have our flaws. A great movie for simply the greatest that's ever played the game.
Diego Maradona,90,,audience,i know everything about the man 'Diego' and about the god 'Maradona' but this bio-pic has found a new and interesting way to present the tremendous and tragic life of the one of the greatest footballer. A must watch!!

It's all here: the great games, goals and great scandals. It teems with life and is unlike most biopics about a sports legend. That is, it actually delivers a pungent sense of the atmosphere surrounding him.

Les misérables,88,88,audience,Doesn't even come close to La haine
Les misérables,88,88,audience,"Heavy and intense, comparable to other gritty films that look at the inevitable tensions (and grey areas) between police, criminals and bystanders in poverty-ridden projects. And it leaves just enough ambiguity/dilemma/possibility at the end to avoid cliche. "
Les misérables,88,88,audience,"This Movie is a must see for anyone who truly appreciates great cinema. This film has a cast of relatively unknown actors, who all give outstanding performances. Some of the best cinematography you will have seen for a long, long time. It's message about the diverse and cultural differences in the inner French suburbs will leave you thinking about this film long after the credits role."
Les misérables,88,88,audience,"Writer-director Ladj Ly finds the epic poetry in the midst of a turbulent and harsh real-life scenario, juxtaposing the violence and the hope in an unique, smart and powerful fashion."
Les misérables,88,88,audience,"Les Misérables is not another interpretation of the Victor Hugo classic but is called so because it is set in Montfermeil, a suburb of Paris where Victor Hugo set his famous story.  It's loosely based around the Paris riots that occurred in 2005 and sees Stephane, a new recruit to the Anti-Crime Squad join two experienced colleagues who are trying to ease tensions between local gangs.  However, tensions run higher than normal after a local boy captures images of police brutality during the course of an arrest.  The police race to get the images before they are released while local gangs fight for control over the images for their own agendas.
Les Misérables is a raw and energetic film that puts you right on the streets of the suburbs of Paris.  It's a well orchestrated and powerful story that isn't afraid to address the ugly elements of street life on these housing estates where the police and local gangs both play off each other for their own advantage.  The cast is brilliant and none more so than the younger actors who showcase the despair and disaffection of the people caught in the middle of the cold war on the streets until it all erupts in an explosive final act.   Beautifully shot, well worth watching."
Les misérables,88,88,audience,"A near three-hour epic that one wishes was longer. The songs and emotions will be stuck with you long after you watch this film. A brilliant adaptation of the play.

The instant I started watching this film, I knew I would love it.

From the beginning, one can tell that the scale of this movie will be massive. From the overarching boats and the rich bass. Les Miserable is rich and vivid in color and song. One can tell that this is a story of redemption in a gritty world.

And does it get gritty. Anna Lynch-Robinson's clever set design makes 19th century France a world of contrasts. We see the extreme wealth and refinement of the bourgeois to the lowest depths of poverty. 19th century France is society ready to boil over.

The performances of everyone in this film is powerful and emotional. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean giving us a sense of life on the run. Russell Crowe is the unforgiving Javert. Though most people hated Crowe's performance, I enjoyed it. Anne Hathaway as Fantine, a loving mother who would do anything to give her daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), a better life. The stunning performance of Samantha Barks as Eponine stole the screen away. Not to mention Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter's performances as the comic relief Thenardier and Madame. The entire cast is star-studded and gives a performance unmatched.

Then the excitement comes once the revolution happens. The unmatched enthusiasm of the young yearning for a better France. The fight between the establishment and the rebellious. Scores of actors, action, and scenery that gives chills. Beautifully well done and artfully crafted.

I normally don't watch musicals, but the screen adaptation of the play/novel is phenomenal. There is no pause and the audience feels the events rolling as the film progresses. Les Miserables is a massive story that's told and retold time and time again. You can't watch this film without crying or tearing up.

5/5. Tom Hooper's masterpiece of a film. One of the best films of the year."
Les misérables,88,88,audience,"Spettacolare; la potenza delle immagini e dei colori rapisce subito lo spettatore, portandolo nei condomini della banlieu parigina e facendogli conoscere tutti i personaggi, credibili e ben delineati, negli atti quotidiani della loro vita.
L'intreccio della trama è notevole, unico clichè la polizia che ""nasconde"" le prove degli errori.
Il finale è semplicemente meraviglioso, pianta un coltello nello stomaco di chi guarda e lo lascia lì a dissanguarsi."
Les misérables,88,88,audience,"Les Misérables isn't an easy watch but for an Directorial Debut it was an Masterpiece. I mean the Fact that this is the first Movie from the Director is Insane even because it is really good. And I didn't in a hundred Years, saw those last 15 Minutes coming.
RATING: 4,68"
Les misérables,88,88,audience,pretty heavy stuff. Generally a bit slow at the beginning but pace speeds up from the middle through to the end. Im not so sure about the ending... But I really enjoyed this film. Very sad and very relevant.
Les misérables,88,88,audience,"Not that one, but French-Malian writer-director Ladj Ly's feature-length remake of his 2017 short, nominated for Best International Feature at the Oscars 2020. Set in Montfermeil, an ethnically diverse and economically deprived district of Paris, it tells the story from the point-of-view of a trio of policemen from the Anti-Crime Brigade, an interesting inversion of La Haine, whose DNA is all over this film. Damien Bonnard's good-hearted newbie Ruiz, Alexis Manenti's hot-headed leader Chris, and Djebril Zonga's local boy made good who has joined the police rank, Gwada, keep the peace in the projects where criminal gangs and the Muslim Brotherhood fight for control and where underprivileged kids, played by non-professionals which give it an extra layer of authenticity, run amok. Narrative elements such as rookie cop's first day on the job (Training Day) and a seemingly innocuous incident that will spark off tensions that are already on the precipice of boiling over (Do The Right Thing), will all be too familiar to seasoned film-goers; but it's Ly's long documentary style tracking shots that showcase a stylish fluidity and momentum as the lingering malaise hangs in the background. A gritty and timely thriller with a socially conscientious heart, it mostly takes place over one hot summer's day when things are constantly on the verge of kicking off if not for the ACB boys. If their methodology crosses lines they shouldn't, the film seems sympathetic to them, especially with Ruiz doggedly still maintaining that line. Which is why I struggle with the brutal epilogic climax that I find less cathartic and more a jarring and whiplash-inducing left-turn. Either way, there is no denying its urgency and potency and Ly delivers it with bravado and intensity that jolts you from your seat as the film poses a situation that seem pertinently unresolvable."

Inserted into all the grit and violence and naturalistic lower-depths acting, it's this kind of written, acted speech that often makes a neorealist film...

Les Miserables is a tour de force and it's hard to believe this is a debut film.

As a study of injustice and systemic deprivation, and in its description of the conditions necessary for revolution, Ly's film is in its very being a modern Les Misérables.

Les Misérables is an urgent and important testimony on the clash between the state and its poorest citizens, and although Ly never manages to make any one character stand out, his broader message is vital.

The Dead Don't Die,54,38,audience,For a comedy this movie is like a stale soft drink: annoying and frustrating.  Like all modern day train wrecks mostly far left leaning movies/shows/etc. it really isn't interesting or funny.  Made it 30 minutes before had to turn off.  Pure trash.  I miss HBO before Turner Broadcasting bought them so sad.
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,audience,The dead don’t die just doesn’t work. It’s fun to see Bill Murray on screen for his dry humor that landed a few jokes but for the most part this is one of the worst zombie movies I’ve ever seen. There’s no real zombie action until almost an hour into the film. Characters pop up and disappear without any resolution.The dialogue try to hard to be funny and witty but comes off mostly dull. Despite having a great cast this film really fall short.
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,audience,I can't believe I wasted the time required to watch this movie.
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,audience,Soooooo much wasted potential.
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,audience,"Looking at the cast list I thought ""hey this is going to be great"" I watched the whole thing expecting for something funny to happen, but I was as bores as Bill Murrays character acted through the whole movie.  Watch the trailer, it has the only funny moments in the movie and its' done in 30 seconds."
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,audience,The criticism for this movie is outrageous. I thought it was a great movie. Lots of zombies and comedy and the cast was perfect for the movie. Kind of like Shaun of the Dead but better.
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,audience,It's one of those movies that has a hidden point but the point is just plain pointless
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,audience,"This Jim Jarmusch take on Zombie films is just okay.  It has some laughs, but overall it's not that funny.  It has a couple running jokes throughout the movie that are simply just not that funny.  The movie is led by Bill Murray and Adam Driver and has quite a few other well known actors scattered throughout the movie.  It is not a terrible movie, but also is not a must see film."
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,audience,This movie is so meta sometimes! It has its funny moments but it is all over the place with various things.
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,audience,"Do not waste your time on this pile of shit. I signed up for an account on here just to warn others. I'd rather watch a porno staring  Donald Trump and Betty White then ever see another minute of this film. Please Jim, stop making films.

The Dead Don't Die,54,38,critic,"
The Dead Don't Die is only for a very specific type of filmgoer, and even those with a predilection toward liking Jarmusch's films may find their patience tested by its lack of entertainment value.

Jarmusch has mastered the art of casting an ensemble that truly gets his unique artistic voice.
 "
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,critic,"
Jarmusch, however, seems caught between his own, unique style and the needs of the zombie movie, which demands a certain amount of macabre bloodshed and action.

Although some scenes entertain me minimally, it's still a superficial and somewhat hollow Jarmusch movie about the zombie horror subgenre. [Full review in Spanish]

An intriguing combo of giddy light-headedness and a bit of good, old-fashioned, punk nihilism.
 "
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,critic,"
If his 2003 vampire movie was Jarmusch looking into the mirror (the bloodsuckers were stylish hipsters with a fondness for urban decay and Neil Young), the new zombie movie is Jarmusch looking out the window -- and being distressed by what he sees.
 "
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,critic,"
At first, it's quite amusing but as the film goes along, I'm not sure what the purpose of [the meta nature] actually was. The rest of the film feels like a rather weak version of others that have done it before.
 "
The Dead Don't Die,54,38,critic,"
It's not worth the energy, space, or time. And maybe that's the worst thing you could say about The Dead Don't Die: it's so inept and boring that it's not even worth the time spent critically analysing it.

The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot,74,51,audience,"This film is really very nice and much more serious than I expected, entertaining from start to finish and full of hidden meanings that you can interpret."
The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot,74,51,audience,"This is not a movie for young people. This is a movie about growing old. It's about a man who has led an eventful life and has memories that haunt him, some good and some bad. He has regrets, as old men who have led eventful lives tend to have. He also has a younger brother who keeps him anchored. And, he has a dog that loves him. 

The movie resonated with me, since I am also an old man who has led an eventful life, though not as accomplished as this one. I have brothers who keep me anchored. I don't currently have a dog, but I have known what it means to be loved by a family pet. 

Still, there is not much here for a younger person. It lacks explosions and car chases. The key moments are subtle and nuanced, but profoundly emotional."

The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot,74,51,audience,"The combination of Elliott's top-tier monotone and a backstory with laughably sincere elements provides a great contrast to the brilliantly whacky B-movie premise. The film succeeds in how somber it is despite its poor pacing and overtly insane plot, a combination that will be entirely hit-or-miss with audiences but is at least original. I mean, we're talking about a film where a somber war veteran is plagued by memories of his lost love taken from him due to commitments to his country that were ultimately futile in his own eyes, but also where Bigfoot projectile vomits into Sam Elliott's face.

This film isn't so much about the hunt itself, but rather the broken man behind it, and as a more contemplative character study, it's commendable.

Unfortunately, the narrative doesn't always hang together but there's no doubting Krzykowski's feature bow is a labour of love.

Non-Fiction,87,48,audience,"Non-Fiction is a film I would expect Woody Allen to write and direct. Hopefully he picks up rights to a remake, should there ever be one. This borderline esoteric and most certainly self-important film from Olivier Assayas is without the witty-worded dialogue, psychologically layered characters and cleverly thought-out and executed twists that we can often rely upon Woody Allen to produce. Instead, Assayas heavily occupies his far from engaging film with impenetrable dialogue and self-indulgent characters."
Non-Fiction,87,48,audience,"One of those series-of-conversations films that’s a whole genre of French cinema in and of itself, it follows the hypocritical lives of people complaining about their significant others cheating on them while they cheat on their significant others. (The question then, is if revenge is why they’re cheating in the first place?) Why the producers thought that Non-fiction would be a better title for English-language audiences is a mystery. The original Double Lives is more apt, or perhaps one of the jokes of the film, “Auto-fiction”. The acting is terrific with a top-notch cast. "
Non-Fiction,87,48,audience,"Somehow, a movie that contains several scenes of French artists, actors, writers, and publishers, sitting around a room eating and drinking wine, discussing the future of the literary world did NOT come off as pretentious. The title is a misnomer, as Léonard's (Vincent Macaigne) books are clearly autobiographical, as much as he tries to deny it — he refers to his work as ""autofiction,"" a term I will be stealing. These Parisians, as the stereotypes go, can't seem to keep it in their pants, and are all cheating on their significant others (sometimes with each other's significant others), except for Valérie (Nora Hamzawi), who is cold and unlikeable at first, but by the end is the most endearing character. Valérie also has the chillest reaction to being told she has been cheated on that has ever made its way on screen. This definitely is not the film for everyone, and some of the business conversations concerning hard copies and e-books and the future of publishing seemed a bit dated, like they were having a conversation for 2015 in 2019. I'd like to see a sequel if only to see whether Selena (Juliette Binoche) actually kills Léonard, who is back on his bullshit."
Non-Fiction,87,48,audience,"Congrats to the writer, director and actors.  They were so good that I did not realize this was a bad movie until it was over.  Every French stereotype is confirmed here.  They love to eat, drink, talk, talk, talk and have affairs.  And all of this with no emotion.  And not a single laugh.  Uggh, a well-paced story about nothing."

Non-Fiction,87,48,audience,"I found 'Non-Fiction' insufferable, unfunny, and a near total bore.  The performances aren't bad and that's the only reason this film gets the score that it does.  What does one learn from Olivier Assayas' latest?  The filmmaker needs to make bolder decisions and maybe cast someone more believable in the role of the guy who is overweight, bald, depressed, frumpy and just overall miserable in a role where he has a beautiful powerful wife and a hot actress girlfriend.  Couldn't buy it and it took me out of the movie.  The film just doesn't work unless except in it's own self-importance.  Final Score: 4.0/10"
Non-Fiction,87,48,audience,"Non-Fiction is a witty yet wordy French comedic drama. All of the acting is great. The ensemble, led by Juliette Binoche, all delivered solid performances. The best part of the film is writer/director Oliver Assayas’ script. The dialogue is very engaging. The film is basically just a bunch of conversations that tackle ideas such as modern technology and love affairs. But the way the film is written stops you from being bored. However, the film does get a bit too wordy at times. Also, there are some pacing issues. Still, this is engaging material nevertheless. Overall. Assayas has crafted an entertaining film with interesting ideas. "
Non-Fiction,87,48,audience,Pues... tambièn esperaba màs...
Non-Fiction,87,48,audience,"Alain is a publisher. He's married to Selena (Juliette Binoche), an actress in a cop show. Leonard is a schlumpy author who's long overdue for a haircut. He's married to Valerie, an earnest assistant to a political candidate.
 
Alain has published several of Leonard's books and the two couples are nominally friends. Near the start of the film, Alain tells Leonard (in a weaselly sort of way) that he's taking a pass on his latest work, a thinly veiled semi-autobiographical novel purporting to be fiction. In recounting the meeting to Selena later, it becomes clear that his decision was based less on the content of Leonard's book and more on his growing disdain for Leonard himself.
 
In case you didn't guess by the names (""Leonard"" and ""Valerie"" actually have little accent marks that I'm too lazy to deal with), this is a French movie. And being a French movie, almost everyone in the whole damn film is having an affair and maybe half of them smoke. They get together with their friends and talk and talk, never just shooting the breeze, but always about highbrow subjects about which everyone has really strong opinions. Their favorite topic is the effect the digital age has had upon printed books and writing in general, but they also debate whether it's permissible to use your real-life experiences with other people in your fiction and whether trying to win an election makes a politician inherently selfish.
 
I am of course paraphrasing. To say that this movie is talky is an understatement. Given that I don't speak French, I guess for me it was very ""readie"", or perhaps ""writey"" is the better analogy. I did my best to keep up, but in reality, even if everyone was speaking English, I would have still been struggling. I can't imagine being at one of these dinner parties. I envision myself saying ""wait…"" a lot and asking for clarification and then eventually giving up and trying to change the subject to a personal story, like the time (yesterday after the movie) that I got half-drenched (my left half) with dirty puddle water by a passing off-duty ambulance while walking home from the theater and wondered whether the driver did it on purpose and possibly even caught it on camera for the amusement of everyone back at the station. But yah, that thing about whether tweets and blogs are the equivalent of the writing of some ancient guy I never heard of, that's interesting too.
 
For me, the best part about this movie, and virtually every French movie, is that I'm fascinated by the French way of life, at least as depicted on film, where almost everyone seems to be wealthy and have country houses and tons of friends that they get together with all the time to eat and drink and talk themselves silly. While one of the characters is launching into a speech about ""blah blah blah digital media"", I'm focusing on how half of the people in the room are wearing scarves and just how would you go about tying a scarf that particular way anyway?
 
And look, instead of serving burgers or chicken at their barbecue, they've grilled entire fishes and veggies…veggies I don't even recognize. And isn't it lucky how no matter how crowded a cafe is, they always manage to find one little table in the middle of the room. I wonder, are Parisian cafes always so lively? Maybe I should go to Paris. If I went to Paris, would I be able to find the empty table? No, I'd probably just walk out of the café without even trying. French people are much more confident than me. Probably because of their scarves.
 
I'm also intrigued by the relationships French movie characters have with their children. Alain and Selena have a son maybe 5 or 6 years old. We see him briefly exactly twice and Alain inquires as to his whereabouts one other time (Selena's mom took him to an amusement park). On both of the boy's token appearances, once accompanied by a nanny, Alain launches into an exaggerated bout of giggle-inducing horseplay, whisking the tyke into the air and carrying him upside-down by his feet, while Selena runs in for a big hug as if greeting a long lost friend. Thirty seconds later, parenting duties attended to and the child dispatched to what I can only assume is a tastefully-decorated nursery, Alain and Selena resume their child-free existence of careers, affairs, cafes, dinner parties, and discussing the fate of civilization in the world of e-readers.
 
I was surprised to see that this film is classified as a comedy (along with a drama and a romance). I did emit a small chuckle once at Selena's directness in dumping a lover, but save for one audience member who seemed to laugh every time Leonard appeared on screen, once a loud chewer behind me finally finished his popcorn, the theater was pin-drop quiet. (Whenever a movie has a lone laugher, I always assume he's high. (Yes, I said ""he"". Lone laughers are almost always male.))
 
There is one attempt at humor or at least self-referential shenanigans that happens near the end of the film. Leonard asks which celebrity should be hired to record the audiobook version of his new novel and Selena replies ""Juliette Binoche"". Surprisingly, this line got no audible response from the audience whatsoever. No laughs, no groans, no walking out en masse. I wondered if I was the only one who got it or if perhaps everyone else was asleep by then. Of course, I was silent also, but I do most of my reacting in my head, and in this case my head was disappointedly shaking.
 
Back in the day when I used to go to two movies a week and felt compelled to see every single well-reviewed film ever released, I would have been more prone to recommend something like this. But now that I've become a much more casual moviegoer, comfortable with the notion that life will go on if I take a pass on movies that I probably won't like so much as appreciate, I realize that virtually no one I know would be likely to come out of this movie raving about it. It was something to do on a rainy afternoon, which is all I was really looking for. Could've done without getting drenched by an ambulance on the way home, but one can't have everything.

The Other Side of the Wind,84,59,audience,"Typical of Welles, this is a busy narrative, exploring the fraught thought processes of a creative mindset amongst a group of like-minded individuals, all either vying for the adulation of, or trying to discredit, a Director who flirts with the affections of others, whilst endlessly pursuing the massaging of his extremely narcissistic ego. Cinematically, the film is nigh-on flawless, with great use of angles, settings, and the constant changes between colour and black and white. That the film proper is presented in 1.37:1, while the film within the film is in 1.85:1, is testament to Welles' layered thinking as a visionary. Something I hadn't really appreciated the impact of, is that although she co-wrote the screenplay, Oja Kodar's character never speaks. And THAT sex scene! It was like a cinematic orgasm. It's such a believable story in how it's directed as a mockumentary, that it actually feels like a biopic. Given the long production, it being another of his unfinished projects, and the satirical constructs aimed at European Atmospheric Cinema (popularised in the 1960's) within the writing, it's most definitely a film that will stand for time as a monolith"
The Other Side of the Wind,84,59,audience,"This is IMHO the absolutely WORSE movie ever uploaded to Netflix.  OW was an iconic gifted actor (when he was young as well as a gifted director) but this film is nothing but a hackneyed spliced together disaster that Netflix decided to distribute to compliment their excellent documentary THEY'LL LOVE ME WHEN I'M DEAD.  This is nothing other than an embarrassing disaster that NFLX at a crescendo bull market at a tad over a 227 billion market cap and an 83 PE ratio has the luxury to distribute without embarrassment (TSLA is at  over a 1300 PE ratio btw).
Stay away from both stocks and this asinine movie."
The Other Side of the Wind,84,59,audience,"The last film of the great Orson Welles, presents the story of an old alcoholic director disgraced by Hollywood and his ambitious pupil, on the night of his movie's debut at his luxurious house. Within the aforementioned plot, we are shown ""parts"" of the old director's movie: ""The other side of The Wind"".
Thus, Welles is able to mock European Art Cinema and at the same time, tell a great narrative on ambition and betrayal."
The Other Side of the Wind,84,59,audience,"The lost film of the late Orson Welles is an insightful and thoughtful retrospective of its brilliant filmmaking career, that despite not being as iconic as Citizen Kane, it's a must-watch for film enthusiasts."
The Other Side of the Wind,84,59,audience,"If you don't know the story behind it, this movie just feel like an avant gard nonsensical thing.

After watching the documentary ""They'll love me when I'm dead"" you can definitely appreciated more and even find it masterpiece-like.

The truth resides in the middle, it is hard to avoiding getting a headache or falling sleep while watching it."
The Other Side of the Wind,84,59,audience,"It's difficult to know if this was what Orson Welles wanted to show, or just a collection of disperse images, like looking lost photograms and trying to figure out from there the sequence of the wreckage."
The Other Side of the Wind,84,59,audience,"In the Film The Other Side Of The Wind who is the leading man? John Huston? Peter Bogdanovich? And who is the leading lady? is it Lilli Palmer? Susan Strasberg? It all depends on your point of view. Who's the hero? Are they all villains? But in the movie within the movie, also titled, The Other Side Of The Wind, we know who are leads are. It's Oja Kodar as The Woman, and Bob Random as ""John"" Oscar Dale. There is no ambiguity, except the plot.

 Maybe that's the real quest, to get to the other side of all that talk and hot air, until the check has cleared the bank. Deals come and go, but there is no business without the show.  The show must go on, but they have no leading man. They have all that footage in the wind, but without the money, what do they have really? Welles making a movie he wouldn't have made. It's the movie Hannaford would have made if he could get the money and his leading man back. It's a movie about Hollywood trying to make a movie that isn't a Hollywood movie, or rather not making it. It's a movie that no one wants anything to do with, not even it's leading man. And with no leading man, and no money to finish it, it finishes off it's director. But is this  an homage to Hollywood, or a parody of it. Is the movie within the movie an homage to Art House Film, a parody, or both?

The movie within the movie is poking fun at European Art House Cinema, showing it in all it's glorious pretentiousness, while at the same time honoring it for it's beautiful symbolism. While the movie echos exactly the same for Hollywood Movies. It shows how it's all hollow. Because what is Tinsel Town but fakes, frauds and facades. A facade, as hollow as John Dale dummies -- as full of hot air as that giant phallus the leading lady goes after with the scissors.

Hedda Hopper once said, ""The only thing Hollywood worships is success, a bitch goddess who smiles and hides her taste for blood"". This film shows us that Hollywood. But in the Art Film, The Other Side Of The Wind, there is no dialog. There is no ""out of character"" voice to spoil the beauty, like Lina Lemont in Singing In The Rain. 

So, is Jake Hannaford the other side of the wind? Or is it Orson, or Oja? John Dale? Or is it just some muse that must be chased, just as John Dale chases after the woman? Welles gives us all of the possibilities and none of them as answers. That is what Welles is telling the audience. Many questions asked, most are left unanswered. Was Hannaford's death accidental, deliberate, or a self-fulfilling prophecy? Take your pick. Cut."
The Other Side of the Wind,84,59,audience,"Abolutely chaotic, dizzying, extremely trippy, sexually charged, fetishy. Some of the most complicated directing I've seen outside of Brazil, beyond Stone or Scorsese. Insane editing. A massive commentary on the state of cinema in the 1970s. A total departure from conventional cinematic form, perhaps influenced by a combination of Antonioni's Zabriske Point and Bergman's Passion of Anna."
The Other Side of the Wind,84,59,audience,"Incredible film, what an achievement. There's depth and layers to this that I think aren't obvious to everyone, as well as a sense of self pushing through from Welles.
This is as good as a lot of his work, and I am so glad it finally saw the light of day."
The Other Side of the Wind,84,59,audience,"Orson Welles's final film is a masterfully edited and thinly veiled meta-narrative exploring the aging of classic Hollywood through the gaze of an aging director. The film, though often a tough bit of meat to tear one's teeth through, sits boldly on the tongue, savory if passing—vaguely intimate while surprisingly profound with its earnestness and blunt sincerity. This particular film won't be for everyone, but those digging its flavor will find it a nourishing, refreshing, filling meal."

The performance of Jude Law and Natalie Portman were mesmerizing. This is a movie for people who enjoy stories with unique complexities and juxtapositions. I think there is a very clear reason why this movie didn't get rated very well and it's because it addresses two major issues in our culture. One being the exploitation of the entertainment industry and two being the very real and necessary action on gun control but done so in a very objective way in which you don't necessarily feel like the opinion of the writers are being blatantly expressed. Criticism are the lack of character development between Celeste and her sister which seemed to be significant enough to show the progression of their estrangement over time. Beautifully done and highly recommend."
Vox Lux,61,37,audience,"I love Natalie's work: like until this film,i wouls have said she could have played a ""pterodactyl"" with class...and even now,maybe the script and director are at fault. The cinematographer also shot this like iPhone out takes and the narrative lacks purpose and soul... Its painful and cringe worthy.. I don't know who is to blame but awfulness personified if you can take the light of natalie and make it poopy."
Vox Lux,61,37,audience,"I couldn't finish this movie.

It was absolutely riveting right up to the point it shifted to the main character being an adult.  Once Portman stepped in the whole movie fell apart.

To date I've had no problem with her acting, but this effort was atrocious.  And to be fair I don't entirely blame her.  The director must also have had a hand.

The problem is the adult version of the protagonist seems to have no similarities to the younger version.  It's like Portman and the Director made no effort to connect he two.  It was like Portman acted the role in a complete vacuum and didn't even considered it needed to be linked back tot he younger Celeste. The result is jarring and 10 minutes into Portman's affront I turned it off.  

Jude Law's character is also obnoxious, but admittedly that is intentional.  It did, however, make it easier to turn off.

It's a shame really because the first half of he move showed so much promise and Raffey Cassidy's effort is noteworthy."
Vox Lux,61,37,audience,"He necesito semanas para asimilar VOX LUX. Brady Corbet dirige un cuento de 'terror' sobre la fama, la decadencia y la autodestrucción en un tono triste y demoledor emparejado a Black Swan. Como si Von Trier dirigiese una película que es mejor A Star is Born que A Star is Born."
Vox Lux,61,37,audience,"Portman is great but the film has no idea what it wants to say, other than it wants to be deep."
Vox Lux,61,37,audience,"Vox Lux is another in a long line of rockstar movies that goes down all the same old roads. You’ll see drugs, and sex, and a once innocent young girl turn into an intolerable egomaniac. If there’s anyone in the world who isn’t tired of this never-ending trope that seems to crop up in more movies every single year, then maybe this is one you can try to see how awful these movies can be. Frankly, I’m kind of bored with the whole thing. Vox Lux tries to take a new path with the story by connecting her career with tragedies, but I don’t think that made much difference for me. It felt like they were trying to say something about senseless acts of violence and societies desire to numb ourselves rather than dealing with them, but I don’t think the film was effective at presenting that message. Putting it in the context of the traditional pop-star self-destructive plot dilutes the whole thing. It doesn’t help that Natalie Portman is a terrible actress who delivers a performance that is so far over-the-top that it’s almost impossible to see her as the same character that Raffey Cassidy played in the first half of the film. I suppose I should be glad that Portman had such a limited role, but even in small doses I find her acting obnoxious. It’s also worth mentioning how weird and off-putting the casting decisions are in Vox Lux with the shifting role of the aforementioned Raffey Cassidy, and then the choice to not recast Stacy Martin for the second half. I think the film as a whole is making an attempt to be something new and interesting, but the end product felt old and routine. If anyone figures out a better way to make a movie about a recording artist who gains unexpected fame, then I’ll be first in line to see it, because seeing the same old stuff is annoying."
Vox Lux,61,37,audience,"Vox Lux is a pop music-infused drama that takes you to uncomfortable places. It ambitiously takes on a little too much, however, the style, score, and performances are all spot on. Fame comes with a price. A tragic star is born."
Vox Lux,61,37,audience,"Even though the first part of the film is rather slow, this one is resumed thanks to the charisma of a very strong Natalie Portman. Through the presentation of this troubled pop star, the director manages to sum up the principles and all the contradictions of today's society."
Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
Vox Lux is a lot of movie.

Ultimately, while interesting, as a look at celebrity culture the last half of Vox Lux is as auto-tuned as the songs the Celeste sings at the end of the film.
 "
Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
Despite some unneeded narration by Willem Dafoe that gives the film some slight pretension, Vox Lux still manages to be an ambitious masterpiece.
 "
Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
It should be great, and indeed from promotional art and trailers it looks great, but the final production is a crushing disappointment.

Corbet abandons the nuanced development of Celeste for a Lady Gaga-Katy Perry mashup, by way of Jersey Shore.

Trauma is the new ennui. That may sound cynical, but Vox Lux is too amoral to be cynical. It's cold and cruel -- maybe even bitter -- but not cynical.

Not even Portman's solid performance as the pop diva can sustain the unbalanced narrative. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
It's all a bit of a mess, but that's part of the point: tragedy and entertainment are intertwined, and the media ruthlessly exploits suffering for eye-grabbing headlines.

Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
And as a character study, the film should've let Portman improvise and riff on a predetermined set of topics for each scene.

Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
Natalie Portman sings Sia's songs in this boldly stylised and intellectually ambitious film about pop music.

Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
Fascinating and daring, isolating small bursts of consolation in a deeply upsetting time while asking how enduring joy can exist for kids brought up on relentless heartache.
 "
Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
Vox Lux is an exquisite pop-infused masterpiece that solidifies Portman's status as one of the most daring actors currently working.
 "
Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
Music is beside the point here. Vox Lux is concerned with the desensitizing powers of idol worship, with all its relevant connections. It understands the lure of escape and questions the effects of that desire.
 "
Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
...there is much to congratulate Brady Corbet's second feature on. These varying grand ambitions, however, never quite harmonise to full effect, leaving VOX LUX feeling more diminuendo than crescendo as it progresses.
 "
Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
A difficult at times to watch film, especially the scenes of violence in the school and on the beach resort, used probably as only context, still seem really fresh in everyone's minds which might put some viewers off.

A work of great style, sharp observations and unexpected tonal shifts... It confirms Corbet as a vital and genuinely special voice in filmmaking.

By the time his heroine is belting out her third-rate songs in a sequined jumpsuit, you can't help but wish you'd stayed home.

Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
The entire film rests on Natalie Portman. There's no question about her commitment to this role, but we think that it's too over the top and becomes tedious, especially with it's abrupt end which left us in stunned silence.
 "
Vox Lux,61,37,critic,"
Great performances and the director's determination to plunge us into uncomfortable territory make it an experience you are unlikely to forget.

Suspiria,65,65,audience,I thought that the remake portrayed the story a lot better than the original and was jam packed full of suspense and intrigue and terror at the same time as being - dare I say it - sexy. Amazing film for its genre imo. Really good.
Suspiria,65,65,audience,"One of the few movies that I can´t believe it was allowed to be made. 

Guadanino delivers not only one of the best remakes of any horror movie but one of the few movies of the decade that doen´t seem to be influenced by the general 21th century Hollywood standards that are slowly killing western cinema. 
Incredible soundtrack by Thom yorke and one of the best looking movies of the year thaks to the amazing cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom and the excellent procuction design.

Truly a masterpiece that sadly will get overlooked due to the reputation that this classic horror remakes have. 
Whish more directors had the freedom that the studio gave Guadagnino to express their vision."
Suspiria,65,65,audience,"Never saw the original. I can say that this one was plenty disturbing in parts, but the final act ridiculous. Definitely only palatable for a specific audience."
Suspiria,65,65,audience,"This movie was a complete mess in my opinion. Perhaps if I had never watched the original film this one would have been tolerable, but not likely. The acting was terrible, the plot was poorly developed, and the mood set by the original was non-existent. The 70s version was hard to follow and it worked for that version--not so with this one."
Suspiria,65,65,audience,"This remake version of suspiria is nothing like the original, but in a good sense. Although the story in general could be somewhat confounding and esoterical, the usage of haunting body horror, beautiful cinematography, stellar cast performance, and Thom Yorkes music makes Suspiria 2018 a cinematic gem."
Suspiria,65,65,audience,I've been seriously missing out on Dakota Johnson's filmography.  She has been picking some good roles!!
Suspiria,65,65,audience,"You can almost reach out at touch the sets, Luca has such a way with Textures and setting a mood. It’s his vision of horror and it’s so beautiful and grotesque "
Suspiria,65,65,audience,One of the few remakes in existence that refuses to just commit cinematic copy-paste tactics like Gus Van Sant's Psycho nor convoy lame in-fashion horror trends/ideas. This modern Suspiria has a far more compelling narrative than the original and shocks with it's thematic subtlety.
Suspiria,65,65,audience,What an awesome movie. Luca did an excellent job. I was glued to my seat.
Suspiria,65,65,audience,"A bit of an oddball outing. No idea what was going on half of the time. What I do know is that a girl gets accepted into a dance school, but that dance school is actually a front for a witch's coven! Aside from that, you're on your own. It's very odd, it's very bloody, but it's very well done."
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
It's got ideas, but to what end?

Color me simply perplexed-but if this Suspiria is hard to love (or sometimes even defend), it's still more intriguing than one might have feared.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
Luca Guadagnino's remake of Italian maestro Dario Argento's surreal 1970s classic is a cauldron of heady ideas and images - but unlike the spine-tingling original, it's just too full to come to the boil.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
One of the year's truly great films.

Suspiria will undoubtedly split audiences...But for those not put off by its open-minded intentions or its visible flaws, it will sublimely leave you bewitched.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
It's a more digestible form of hypnosis, and as the film progresses, it becomes increasingly layered in its parallelism of craft, politics, and war.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
It's a horror film that's too ridiculous to be scary, an outrageous bloodbath that's too dour to be fun, and an examination of post-war turmoil that's too shallow to be affecting.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
[It]...will probably turn off most general filmgoing audiences. Yet, if you're willing to give something outside the norm a try, or you're a fan of the of the original and can get past the idea that remaking it would be sacrilege, I highly recommend it

[A] stunningly crafted horror classic.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
A film with some interesting ideas left adrift, like dancers on a stage that's far too large for them to move across efficiently.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
A film that tries to be as experimental as its namesake but botches its storytelling and pacing decisions.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
In creating its own curious mix of history, supernaturalism, queerness and style, the film deserves to be celebrated as an original, truly fearless piece of cinema.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
Yet, despite the fantastical, nightmare images, this remake ultimately seems to be more of an exercise in filmmaking than storytelling.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
Suspiria is equal parts alienating and hypnotic
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
I think the film has loads of potential, but is too bloated as of now.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
It's dark, tense, and oozes of evil.
 "
Suspiria,65,65,critic,"
Suspiria is nothing if not ambitious, but when a film tackles such a broad swath of heavy topics, it becomes difficult to treat each one with the weight it deserves.

The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,89,77,audience,"An interesting proposal, an alternative way of telling a story, very good performances, a lot of drama, tragedy is in the air."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,89,77,audience,"Joyful and quite thought-provoking, typically the third and the last segment."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,89,77,audience,Gleefully sardonic in its treatment of the Western genre. A worthy addition to the Coens' cinematography.
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,89,77,audience,Without doubt this atrocity is a failure as both a Western and a Comedy. It is among the worst movies I have ever tried to sit through. Every copy should be deleted.
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,89,77,audience,"Another hilarious entry from the Coens. It's an anthology, where every segment covers a different trope or subgenre of Westerns, so the tone is all over the place. It goes from goofy to tragic to pitch black at the drop of a dime. But like most of their films, they balance these tones out expertly to make a quirkiness you're not likely to find elsewhere. I really hope this isn't their last film. The Roy Rogers segment at the beginning had me rolling on the floor."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,89,77,audience,"A mixed bag of a few decent and utterly dull short stories. The first story was very entertaining and unexpected, although it was too short, and the singing at the end was a bit silly. The second story was decent but also far too short. From then on, the stories were poor. The Liam Neeson story with the talking armless/legless man was a complete waste of time and not funny at all. Moreover, the gold digging one was too slow, and the last story lead nowhere. Overall, not very funny, poorly paced, and containing mostly below average stories. Most things were predictable since you knew that they would all end badly for someone. However, the cinematography, visual effects, cinematography, and soundtrack were all decent. The format was unique, but the execution was flawed."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,89,77,audience,A brilliant anthology that lays bare the raw human nature of its characters effectively.
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,89,77,audience,"I guess I'm in the minority, but here goes. The Coen brothers sense of humor escapes me. This film was a compilation of weird western vignettes. I couldn't tell if they were going for comedy, satire, or serious. But, then the only one of their films that I really liked was, ""No Country For Old Men."" They certainly have a unique style, but it doesn't appeal to me. Frankly, I don't see how they've been so successful."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,89,77,audience,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs flawlessly illustrates the versatility of the Coen Brothers film styles, blending tones and tempo to near perfection. Buster Scruggs is easily the best reflection of contemporary westerns films and besides being just a bit too extensive, it's a complete masterpiece."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,89,77,audience,"lol as i write this the audience score on rotten tomatoes  is a misanthropic 77 percent. Ha ha. This film is outstanding. If you are not delighted by every dark tale herein, then you do not love movies. Go and watch chickens feeding instead. The Coen brothers are masters of this art and this is one of their finest films. Of course if you don't like westerns then you have your excuse of rejecting an entire genre out of hand. But for the rest of us every film is about fine acting, great scenery, with evocative sounds .... to above all the gift of story telling. 5 Stars, else you are as stuck up as an old maid!"

Roma,95,72,audience,Unique and satisfying film.  A mostly unremarkable story depicted remarkably.
Roma,95,72,audience,Unbelievably boring. I don't even remember what its about. Its so slow. I enjoyed the Mexican political turmoil though. It makes it very historical.
Roma,95,72,audience,"This is an ""art film"", if ever there were one, and it's bound to give rise to polarised reviews. I won't lavish it with disingenuous praise nor will I disparage it as a boring piece of pretentious cinema. It was an experience to watch Roma for what it was, a slice-of-life portrayal of an ordinary family, dealing with ordinary struggles, in a time and place not all that different from my own."
Roma,95,72,audience,"Had the misfortune of seeing this movie twice, sadly it is time from my life I will never get back"
Roma,95,72,audience,"Epic scale in the service of an intimate portrait, it doesn't always persuade as cinematic storytelling. Beauty can persuade, and there's much here, but it can only do so much. One never feels as if Cuaron is not in total control of his vision, but his vision constricts, flattens, sees all but seems to know little."
Roma,95,72,audience,"Mexican epic from folk point of view with long, breathtaking scenes of everyday life. It hit both my aesthetics and ideas. If you want see thrilling movie just do not watch it."
Roma,95,72,audience,The best of the best
Roma,95,72,audience,"Beautifully shot film of a home worker's journey in Mexico City.  Man of the house is on the way out, and Cleo has relational angst of her own.  Sparse but somehow also full, it's a engaging peek into the life of a woman that in some ways has been discarded but also surprisingly valued by those around her."
Roma,95,72,audience,"Alfonso Cuarón's best film.  Beautiful to look at, amazing acting.  A bit of real life - and all the drama it provides..."
Roma,95,72,audience,"Expertly shot to be beautiful in black-and-white as it would be in color, Roma is a visually pleasing film with a story that's interesting, but overshadowed by its gorgeous cinematography. I don't believe Roma would be nearly as memorable if director Alfonso Cuaron didn't get these breathtaking shots."

The beach sequence encapsulates everything Cuarón has been working for - pairing technical virtuosity and universal human decency to a maximum impact. Quietly spectacular, this larger format, digitally shot film needs to be seen on the big screen.

Roma,95,72,critic,"
A slow-burn film that recalls the Italian Neorealist movement. The goal is a slice-of-life character study rather than plot twists, but if you flip your mental switch, it's a subtly enveloping film that elicits nostalgia.

In Cuarón's films, cinema conjures up its own world, and this one provides the chance to explore it with him more intimately than ever before.
 "
Roma,95,72,critic,"
The movie's distance here works against it, emphasizing its outsider's view of what it frames as lower-class concerns. Instead of lending her character dimensionality, Cleo's tribulations begin to feel cartoonishly grim.
 "
Roma,95,72,critic,"
Roma is intimate, epic and female-focused, not unlike filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron's 2013 intergalactic 3-D odyssey Gravity... But Roma is also an immersive nostalgic valentine to his '70s childhood in Mexico City.
 "
Roma,95,72,critic,"
Fundamentally, it's a character piece about Chloe. Aparicio's placid, yet expressive face sometimes recalls Renée Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc. Hers is a brilliant, unmannered performance.

Clouds,76,91,audience,"A film on struggling with declining health that overwhelms the sick person except the will to live becomes stronger in value terms of preciousness has been similarly told in comparison to a familiar earlier approach and an unexpected echo while depicting the unbelievable rise without losing the important connections. This respectfully hearted, emotionally performed story is doubtlessly faithful with an inspiring degree and made it clear it has not lost the storytelling's purpose of the aforementioned importance as its main point ahead of the built-up success, which effectively makes this picture impactful in a way that hasn't been felt in a long while. (B+)"
Clouds,76,91,audience,"After you laugh and cry too much when you see Clouds, you can answer my question: If you had a disease that cannot be cured: How would you make that tragic moment, very epic and glorious?"
Clouds,76,91,audience,"Clouds always tries to makes the audience feel the maximum emotion, and sometimes it succeeds. When it does not work, it is usually because the feelings are built very not so subtle screenplay forces the plot to convey those emotions. But when it does work, it is because of the stellar acting, naturally set structure, and overall relatability of the scene. Clouds does not force any sentimentality down your throat, but instead makes you look at the titular character as a regular person with limited time, which leads to the film's other pros, like being more bent on comedy than other cancer movies. Clouds, and not forcing itself to be a romance. Clouds is a beautifully and crafted and original film that makes you think about the limited time we have."
Clouds,76,91,audience,"Clouds hits a lot of familiar notes, but it has plenty of genuinely sweet and heartfelt moments with a talented cast to boot that elevates it above disposable young-adult melodrama!"
Clouds,76,91,audience,"An emotional tribute to Zach Sobiech is so good. It also tells that living with a sickness is not bad if you still have hope, family, loved ones and music into your arms."
Clouds,76,91,audience,"This is definitely an inspirational movie, and a must see at that. I love movies that make me aware of these incredible stories that I never would've known about hadn't I watched the movie. It is a very touching and emotional movie with actors and a director who are passionate about making Zachary Sobiecks story heard. Argus and Carpenter as the leads do an amazing job here and they have great voices too. All in all, I'm to have watched this movie, it is a tear-jerker, but I don't regret watching it as there are a lot of great messages that one can take from it."

Clouds,76,91,audience,"Exceptional story, very good representation and acting. I will never recommend this movie enough."
Clouds,76,91,audience,"This movie was inspiring and emotional. It tugs at your heartstrings but emphasizes the good that exists - especially during a time that we probably all need that reminder. Although at points it may have seemed a bit choppy, I believe the film encapsulates teenage life mixed with abnormal trials and high school struggles in a way that is open, honest and real."
Clouds,76,91,audience,I can't stop crying! An emotional masterpiece filled with great music. This true life tale was beautifully brought to the screen. A+
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
A tribute to life, youth and dreams that will move whoever sees it, despite its common places. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
A tough watch and not for everyone.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
If you want to watch one of these teenage weepies this is a decent one
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
Heartbreaking but uplifting true story tackles loss, pain.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
Big on hugs and scant on plot, the gentle, hazy script is jolted by dramatic moments that are quickly ushered away unresolved as if to shrug, that's life.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
With solid performances and genuine heart at its center, Clouds flies a little higher than most sick-teen YA movies.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
This movie pays tribute to Zach [Sobiech] in such a beautiful and inspirational way.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
""Clouds"" has all the makings of a profound and powerful heart-tugger. So why isn't it more wholly moving and cathartic?
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
Despite its poignant true-life subject matter, the emotional swings feel more manipulative than authentic.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
Thankfully, the pathos is somewhat balanced by the movie's upbeat humor.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
Clouds follows a predictable cancer melodrama formula, and it presents Zach as such a saintly, self-sacrificing creative genius that it's hard to believe he was actually a real person.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
This film's honesty is its greatest strength.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
Clouds continues to prove that director Justin Baldoni has a real passion and knack for sharing challenging true stories while honoring the real people and inspiring others in the process.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
Fin Argus and Sabrina Carpenter make CLOUDS worth watching while reminding humanity to cherish yourself and your loved ones every day as tomorrow is not guaranteed. So inspiring and simultaneously heartbreaking lovingly directed by Justin Baldoni
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
This film is particularly perceptive on the issue of what it means to try to be 'normal' under excruciatingly painful circumstances.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
[A] sweet, smoothed-over biopic of teenage singer-songwriter Zach Sobiech, who died aged 18 of cancer, shortly after scoring the viral folk-pop hit that lends the film its title.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
First, it is a true story. Second, it is a fascinating look at how one young man faces adversity and turns lemons into lemonade.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
""Clouds"" comes at a time when our emotions are all over the place and we could use a good cry. It's hard to explain why certain movies touch you more than others, but in this case it's best not to fight those feelings and let the story wash over you.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
""Clouds"" keeps its focus squarely on the ground from start to finish, and it soars that much higher for it.
 "
Clouds,76,91,critic,"
Director Justin Baldoni's young-adult romance knows exactly which audience it's playing to, and accomplishes much of what it sets out to do: break your heart, while leaving you humming a sorrowful-yet-catchy tune.

Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,audience,it is a good movie. aacting of the lead actors are well maintained
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,audience,"This is very very good movie 
Telling us about not to lose hope anyday anytime"
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,audience,"Very inspiring and entertaining.  It gives the picture of India based on the rarely seen combination of Indian cinema - a cute strong girl in an air base, Indian patriotism, arrogant airmen, modern operational system, family bond, etc.  Too impressive to overlook."
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,audience,"Negative portrayal of IAF officers, especially when it is not true."
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,audience,Wrong portrayal of the Indian Air Force.
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,audience,Very slow. Showed army in bad taste. The actress needs some serious acting skills
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,audience,It is a totally stupid movie. Does not reflect the fence culture at all. There is no way a pilot can refuse a sortie. The movie should be banned.
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,audience,"Definitely a really bad movie, The actress's acting was really bad and expressionless, This also is definitely insulting gunjan saxena's story. This is nepotism 1* for the producer who wasted his money on this"
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,audience,"Completely misnformed movie abt the Indian Airforce, no research done what so ever. An Army salute is show among airforece officers for God sake! 
No officer ever will or has said the shit this movies is showing. They don't talk like that!   .....also PATHETIC ACTING by the main lead actress, just awful"
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,audience,"Amazing movie 
If someone is rating this movie less than 3 are definitely terrorists"
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl is a pretty straightforward biopic that finds value in its raw observation of women in the military.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
The real, steady moments where the film shines are in the emotional scenes, stripped of melodrama. The background score subtly and assuredly weaves its magic. An intensely emotional tale told with restraint, Gunjan Saxena seals a place in our hearts.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
Gunjan Saxena is an enjoyable, even inspiring family watch with reasonably decent performances.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
Sharma adds his own achievement to those of his heroine: he's overseen that rare Netflix Original not to feel at least a half-hour too long.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
A story of patriotism and compassion and humanity...
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
The aerial photography, as well as SFX, is excellent, making the training scenes and later the combat flying feels immersive.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
The biopic, which claims to have been liberally dramatised, is an engaging one-time watch. Just like its leading lady, it's easy on the eyes and never yanks you to an uncomfortable space.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
This is one of those films in which you are keenly aware that your buttons are being pushed but it's done so artfully that you relish the experience...
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
The screenplay does a terrific job of fleshing out her personality with an eye on public perception. The film's best scenes feature a young Gunjan doubting her own motivations.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
Could the film have been better? Undoubtedly. Women following their dreams against patriarchal odds? Absolutely.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
Tripathi's natural, low-key, conversational tone serves as the spine of the drama. Angad Bedi, Vineet Kumar Singh and Manav Vij are perfectly in tune with the low-throttle film.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
It wages war against patriarchal mind-set and discrimination, and identifies it as a bigger threat to progress than the one we perhaps tackled in 1999.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
Gunjan Saxena never once veers away from its intent to recount an individual's personal story, staying determinedly intimate even in war scenes.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
One of the better Hindi biopics to have come out in recent times. The writing is consistently empathetic and alert to the insidious nature of gender discrimination without being too preachy.
 "
Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,100,23,critic,"
Gunjan Saxena doesn't subscribe to the hyper-nationalism that recent Indian war films have so proudly worn on their chest. Instead, director Sharan Sharma has chosen to explore a wholly different, but equally thorny topic: feminism.
 "
Son,73,55,audience,"A film that is definitely one of the best things made this year. An interesting story, and a pretty good horror atmosphere. Just unraveling the whole movie could have been better. It was no big surprise in the end, which is a pity that they ruined the end in this way. But he certainly wasn't bored with this film."
Son,73,55,audience,"A film that is definitely one of the best things made this year. An interesting story, and a pretty good horror atmosphere. Just unraveling the whole movie could have been better. It was no big surprise in the end, which is a pity that they ruined the end in this way. But he certainly wasn't bored with this film."
Son,73,55,audience,This movie was horrible. I'm not sure why so many people thought it was scary ?? It was a carbon copy movie with expected turns at every corner.
Son,73,55,audience,Disturbing might be the short way of describing it. The pace of the story is apt and it keeps the audience guessing between paranoia and reality.
Son,73,55,audience,"The movie was just so-so.  Honestly, I am not much of a horror movie guy any longer.  There is not much to see at the movies right now.  The acting and filming was good....just not into this anymore.   2020 was scary enough.....3 stars."
Son,73,55,audience,A very interesting story told in a disturbingly gory movie. Son will please genre fans but not ones who like more than disgusting bloodshed and satanic cults.
Son,73,55,audience,'Son' is an enjoyable horror-thriller backed by committed performances and a laudable execution.
Son,73,55,audience,"Beautifully shot, well-acted, and just all around creepy. It has an ending that will leave you with chills. If you like movies in the vein of 'Hereditary', 'The Babadook', or 'Rosemary's Baby', you'll love this."
Son,73,55,audience,Good but not so horror
Son,73,55,audience,‘Son' Chills With Unsettling Maternal Nightmare
Son,73,55,critic,"
A dark and bloody horror thriller that explores the maternal bond in the face of paranoia and trauma. Is she really being pursued by a cult? Is her son really changing?
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
Twisted and terrifying storytelling.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
Filled with disturbing scenes, plenty of blood and gore, and more than one ghastly moment, Son delivers the chills if not the jumps.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
It really doesn't do anything we haven't seen before and the script is fairly routine, but as a director, Ivan Kavanagh does have some flair.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
Gets credit for exploring the emotional trauma of a mother/son relationship, which is more than what most horror thrillers accomplish, the film is still a mixed bag that keeps you invested but can't resist the urge to stumble into its own spooky traps.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
Very dark and quite disturbing.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
Kavanagh and Matichak do a remarkable job of capturing an amped-up version of everyday parental paranoia.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
Providing only the slightest of variations on possessed children and the mothers who risk everything to protect them, this supernatural thriller indulges in gory genre tropes while lacking subtlety and surprise.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
Generally well-made and well-acted, this horror/thriller still doesn't really work thanks to a repetitive, fairly predictable storyline and many upsetting scenes of a child screaming in pain.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
The narrative becomes slightly predictable...But if that element of surprise is missing...the apocalyptic atmosphere...and Laura's quiet desperation make [i]Son[/i] a recommendation.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
Upholding genre tropes whilst subverting them, Son is an unsettling fever-dream drenched in unspeakable acts that leave viewers on edge until the end.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
You cannot watch Son without feeling a little sick to your stomach.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
It's an intriguing, watchable but mixed bag...
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
Matichak's performance helps to maintain the film's emotional core, while Kavanagh goes about finding new, gory, and disturbing ways to surprise us.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
The movie keeps us tense, guessing and most of all concerned for Laura on her odyssey through a very bloody heartland.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
Son is a hungry horror movie, starving for attention. You better give it what it wants.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
It may lapse into cult horror cliché from time to time but a spooky atmosphere and a strong lead performance from Andi Matichak ensure that Son remains a decent and entertaining horror thriller
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
The commitment to blood-vomiting, entrail-chewing special effects, and the niggle of child peril anxiety makes for an effectively propulsive genre picture.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
With echoes of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and The Babadook, Son is a forever twisting tale of terror and trauma, featuring some excellent performances across the board.
 "
Son,73,55,critic,"
It just doesn't do anything you don't expect it to do.

The Truffle Hunters,97,,audience,Such a wonderful documentary!
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
This documentary is as rare and delicious as the white gold these men seek. Oh, and did I mention there is a doggie cam in this film too?
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
It's a movie that fosters your curiosity -- piques your appetite, if you will -- and pushes you to dig a little deeper.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
Bracing and joyous, the film unearths complex, canine-loving characters who bicker and haggle their way into the audience's hearts.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
What's revealing isn't the tricks of the trade, but that finding your purpose and living with it makes everything in life taste richer.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
The filmmakers are able to provide a three-dimensional look at Piedmont's niche economy through their subjective compiling of objective vignettes.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
This is a portrait of a subculture, not an advocacy documentary.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
There's an absurd sense of profound joy in this gentle documentary, which follows a group of old Italian men who defiantly do things their way.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
I'm glad these guys are doing what they're doing to fuel my appetite, but the movie itself is a little too fringe-y for my taste.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
The movie struck me as both a geezer comedy and a travel poster... It's not nearly as informative as it could have been or should have been.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
It's not just a beautiful movie, but it's a really great one for dog lovers.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
A genuinely enjoyable movie that can appeal to a wide range of viewers.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
It's a beautiful movie, but it also feels like a love poem to something the world is in danger of losing, the fires and clangs of industry and capitalism having no place in the small yet teeming world of this mysterious profession.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
Wonder and whimsy is back in the forest. ""The Truffle Hunters"" - surely among the greatest dog movies - even wryly occasionally shifts to a dog's point of view.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
Directed with a combination of delicate respect and dry humor by Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw, The Truffle Hunters is told mainly with stately gravitas.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
The film, directed and photographed (beautifully) by Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw, is fragrant too, a parallel study in deep gratification and rapt inhalation.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
What we are presented with is essentially a boisterous gallery of aging oddballs. But to their credit the filmmakers never make fun of them. Their eccentricity, because it is rooted in a passion for the natural world, has an innate dignity.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
... takes a strictly observational approach, smartly allowing the quirky subjects to command the spotlight. The result is both hilarious and insightful.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
Getting to know these truly eccentric, fascinating men, their wives, their solitude, and their worlds is as rewarding as the truffles they hunt.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
This excellent, beautifully crafted documentary is by turns charming and revelatory as it depicts the unchanging lives of truffle hunters and the cutthroat tactics of the high-stakes truffle market.
 "
The Truffle Hunters,97,,critic,"
Despite its creators' general fussiness, The Truffle Hunters is good enough, if only because guys like Carlo and Angelo are more charming than they are eccentric.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,audience,"Very spooky film, it's nice to have a fresh look at religious/demonic horror when it's usually so Catholicism heavy. Well acted and shot too"
The Vigil,89,46,audience,"Refreshing horror movie. It is a glimpse of hope that not all horror movie directors and plots suck. This is an actual horror movie, with good acting, a good plot, it's dark, creepy, and well done overall. Bravo. Not quite hereditary, insidious, etc. buts it's definitely good. Recommend! "
The Vigil,89,46,audience,Creepy low key horror that has it's flaws but is worth a look.
The Vigil,89,46,audience,"Not only is this film beautifully made it is a must see for anyone who struggles with a painful past. Well written, good acting and a peek behind cultural curtains."
The Vigil,89,46,audience,Doesn't go anywhere beyond the trailer - mostly just the usual tropes of the genre.
The Vigil,89,46,audience,I thought it was complex creepy as hell and I loved it!
The Vigil,89,46,audience,"A tight atmospheric horror thriller, refreshingly based on orthodox Jewish traditions vs. the usual Christian religious tropes.

Seriously, we need more non-Catholic/Christian horror movies -- that vein has been tapped to death. It seems there is so much interesting lore in Judaism (e.g. The Golem) as well as other major religions (Hindhu, Islam, etc.) which thankfully we are starting to see (Under the Shadow, Tumbbad, etc.).

With vibes of Oculus and 1408, the fantastic score seriously elevates the movie."
The Vigil,89,46,audience,"Incredible performance by Dave Davis, truly a riveting, suspenseful movie that keeps you eerily on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, and now I can't stop saying ""shimmer"".  Bravo"
The Vigil,89,46,audience,"A decent attempt at an indie horror, but doesn't cross the finish line. Sets up some interesting ideas, but doesn't pull through on any of them. Goes from horror to psychological thriller but drops the ball. Doesn't really complete the character arc at all and has some glaring plot holes and issues. Sadly, what could have been great kind of fails to launch. Too bad, because it had some promise."
The Vigil,89,46,audience,"The Vigil ranks as one of the best supernatural films that I have seen in a very long time. The pace of the film is a bit slow but essential to the story line, (which is rooted in the religious beliefs of the Orthodox Jewish culture, regarding the passage of the soul after death.) It was filmed in the United States, and the dialogue is mostly in English, though some Yiddish is spoken. Right from the start,  the movie grips you with an eerie, forboding atmosphere, and generates a steady flow of tension and fear that escalates throughout the film.  It is scarey, and well worth watching. (pardon the pun)"
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
The hook, the cultural aspect, the concept, the unsettling imagery and especially the acting elevate 'The Vigil' above being just another modestly budgeted haunted house movie.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
The most original, most chilling horror film of the new year.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
They accomplish so much here with what is clearly a low budget and basically one location. It's terrifying.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
All these elements set us up to anticipate a horrifying film experience that never quite gels...
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
I loved it for bringing us into the darkness of the mysterious Jewish underworld, but I only wish it did a lot more daring things with it once there.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
The Vigil is a tight and effective horror film that more than entertains...
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
To balance that act with a truthful core and compelling narrative is rare and special, but that is what The Vigil does.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
While The Vigil may not be the scariest horror film you'll see this year...it is worth your time for the care it has for its characters, and Dave Davis more than holds his own.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
The Vigil is simply conceived, pretty much limited to one gloomy interior, and reliant on jump scares. It's nothing amazing, yet it is indeed very creepy, with an atmosphere of slow-building dread that duly gets under your skin.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
Davis manages to convey Yakov's long dark night of the soul with little more to play off of than the draped corpse and his cell phone.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
The Vigil is a beautiful film about grief that is as powerful as it is frightening.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
Part haunted house, part tech thriller, and entirely grounded by Dave Davis' harrowing performance, the film never loses sight of questions of cultural identity, and the ways it intersects with personal and collective trauma.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
The secret to writer-director Keith Thomas' wonderfully creepy debut feature lies in its chilly, self-contained intimacy.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
With its compelling lead and a full embrace of its subject, THE VIGIL succeeds as both a scary movie and a drama of personal struggle.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
For a things-that-go-bump movie, The Vigil is smart, resourceful and surprisingly good.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
Always feels like it is simply dressing up well-worn genre elements in different packaging.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
An insidiously eerie yet affecting experience.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
... a truly Jewish horror film in every sense... Fans of horror and genre detail will find much of interest here... (and) how much research went into getting it all perfectly correct.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
It's structured like a standard horror movie in the Blumhouse tradition, except that it packs in a couple of millennia worth of Jewish folk mythology.
 "
The Vigil,89,46,critic,"
There is a touching human dimension to this tale that brought tears to my eyes.
 "
Truth to Power,83,,audience,"Truth To Power is a powerful documentary film by System Of A Down's very own Serj Tankian. It walks you through the birth of the nu-metal band, lightly touches on their ups and downs, and dives deep into Serj's relentless journey to change the world. I have been a fan of System of a Down since 2000 when I was just a Jr. High kid who wanted to listen to a new band that would immediately change my life. Their music has always been inspiring to me and was the soundtrack of my youth.


This documentary film shows that music can change the world. I got goosebumps listening to Serj discussing his life and giving us a rare look into his journey from childhood to the present day. I loved learning many random facts about Serj, such as that the poems that he wrote before his music career would later become lyrics to many of his songs. His words have always been beautiful, powerful, and thought-provoking. His life mission to rectify injustice is the soul of this film. The fight to get Armenia's genocide recognized is incorporated throughout the documentary, as is the backbone of the Serj's identity and System Of A Down's purpose. Truth To Power is pieced together nicely and well-paced as it is, engaging and inspiring. You will easily walk away from this film with more knowledge and great respect for Serj.

I give Truth To Power a 9 out of 10. It is a rare look into Serj Tankian's life that fans and activists will appreciate. You will also get a better understanding of the suffering that the people of Armenia have experienced."
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
The former feels at first like a pat rock doc, a chronicle of the band's origins and Tankian's journey into metal. It becomes something bigger as Tankian begins to use his world stage to call out the Turks' 1915-1917 genocide of Armenians...
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
This explosive, much-needed call to action against corrupt politics and global inaction couldn't be more timely.
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
""Truth To Power"" is very Serj-focused and sidesteps band drama considerably, but it's an amazing documentary for fans and activists who couldn't care less about band drama.
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
Director Garin Hovannisian constructs Truth to Power into a complex rockumentary, a necessity given Tankian is a multifaceted individual.
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
Go from System of a Down novice to super fan in less than 80 minutes.
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
The film is well-paced, tightly edited and engaging, and at times, it's quite inspiring.
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
Even if you're unfamiliar with both System of a Down and Armenia, the Tankian documentary is worth exploring
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
Hovannisian's documentary would be much more convincing if he picked a single aspect of Tankian's activism -- or composing, or personality -- and considered it in greater detail.
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
Despite his dabbling in many indulgences, Serj Tankian doesn't come off as shallow or particularly superficial here. But this documentary almost does.
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
... tends to gloss over some of Tankian's controversies, yet presents an insightful glimpse into the artistic process, as well as the intersection of politics and entertainment, while chronicling his evolution in both arenas.
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
It's pretty basic stuff...
 "
Truth to Power,83,,critic,"
Tankian has crafted a movie with an overt political ideology and cast himself as the well-intentioned face of a cultural revolution. But none of this takes away from the issues at the center of the film.

The Reckoning,23,44,audience,Your review will help others decide whether to watch.
The Reckoning,23,44,audience,Why? I can't believe a film like this was made....just pure hot garbage.
The Reckoning,23,44,audience,"Not as bad as the critics make it out to be. For the most part, the cinematography, sound, editing and acting were very solid. The story lagged a little in the middle, but overall, it was worth seeing and I learned something about Witcraft in Europe I the 1600's that I never knew."
The Reckoning,23,44,audience,More boring than scary 
The Reckoning,23,44,audience,what a wonderful movie!!!!
The Reckoning,23,44,audience,I walked out of this movie. I didn't know any of the actors and the film studio which made this film. I guess since the  biggest studios haven't been  releasing very many films that what we be seeing for awhile until things get back to normal.
The Reckoning,23,44,audience,"Director Neil Marshall is back with #TheReckoning, a lurid tale of disease, devils and witch trials. While 'The Descent' remains my favorite of his work, nonetheless I enjoyed Marshall's latest effort. My review: https://youtu.be/Mmyn8QdWepQ"
The Reckoning,23,44,audience,"Nothing ground-breaking here, just an engaging, fun witch movie. Sure, you can pick apart plot elements, but overall it's a lot better than most of the reviews I've read."
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
Though the filmmaking and editing is serviceable, it doesn't feel like the hand of a director who seemed so natural and in control of his previous work.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
Poor Neil Marshall: Neither the director nor his leading lady have the talent to salvage this cheapjack Restoration-era horror flick
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
The Reckoning has a lot of problems that fall under the umbrella of its extremely bizarre tone. ... This film is voyeuristic, exploitative, and uses the specifically sexual horrors of the witch hunt era as an excuse to leer rather than to horrify.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
Overall, I don't think it's a terrible movie, but I don't think it's a great one either.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
The central section is tortuous in every sense, though that's balanced by some striking visuals and an understanding of the mechanics of persecution (and how accusers leverage them).
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
Bad film: shallow writing with plenty of torture and showing off instead. Not what I expected from the director behind Dog Soldiers.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
Kirk turns The Reckoning into a rallying cry for women everywhere to refuse to bend to the will of men, which might be the most surprising thing about this fantastically gruesome and highly entertaining horror movie.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
The Reckoking suffers from being too boring, too lacklustre, and too poorly constructed from start to finish, to recommend.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
It's like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, only more boring. What a pity.

The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
The Reckoning is like a bad soap opera with a few squirts of blood and an eyeful of lady butt cheeks for good measure. Its two hour runtime caters to indulgent melodrama over horror, adventure, or anything that would actually resemble entertainment
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
As for where all this is going, well, the film is called The Reckoning. Those who can make it through the second act will certainly be up for the third.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
An exercise in pointless misery, barely even pretending to have a narrative for most of its deadening 110 minutes.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
Feels simultaneously neutered and in poor taste.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
Long and grim, this Black Plague-era witchcraft story is miles away from the artistry and scares of something like The Witch. It focuses instead on endless, uninspired scenes of torture and nightmares.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
The deliberately paced story winds up more tedious than thrilling before a predictable final showdown.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
Just torture, torture, torture, torture.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
[Charlotte Kirk] needs more acting gravitas to bring to this than she did.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
[Kirk's] performance is more Faye Dunaway in cheeky bodice-ripper remake The Wicked Lady than Anya Taylor-Joy's rounded depiction of magical madness and misogyny in The Witch.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
If there was some ultimate point to all of this cannily presented brutality, one might be able to excuse it but as presented, it feels more as if Marshall is indulging in some personal fetishes and forcing viewers to watch as he satisfies them.
 "
The Reckoning,23,44,critic,"
A well-meaning, but consistently staid horror movie about institutionalized misogyny, and the women who have to survive it.

The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,audience,"The Queen of Black Magic is a very effective horror film. The film’s starts off kinda slow. The set up isn’t terrible but it’s fairly standard for the genre. But once it gets going it really gets going. Director Kimo Stamboel shows that he really knows how to direct horror. The film ramps things up to an 11 very quickly. The gore is brutal and effective. The narrative also takes some interesting turns that keeps you interested. Overall, I had a great time with this. If you are looking for some well done horror I definitely recommend checking this out. "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,audience,"This is a good horror. Your average American viewer like me will enjoy the novelty of an Indonesian horror, but it has more layers than that. It touches on childhood trauma, family tragedy, vanity, and so much more with stunning visuals and phenomenal acting."

The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
Leans on more than a few horror tropes, but never feels like a by-the-numbers haunted house movie.
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
Each characters' tale stands up just enough on its own to make for specific scares, and they all blend together to create the blanketing sense of dread.
 "

I found the extremely uncomfortable torture and gore fascinating to watch.
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
A perfect horror movie slasher for those who love their gore and violence ramped up to the max, but for others it may turn their stomachs.
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
A solid recommendation for fans of old school Asian black magic horror, winning extra points for really going pedal to the metal as it hurtles towards its nasty conclusion

The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
Brimming with brutal, haunting visuals that are further amplified by the rock solid ensemble and scare scenes with character history at the core.

Even if [Stamboel] doesn't actively seek it, the unpleasantries always show up first, paving the way for diminishing returns...
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
Any semblance of internal plot logic gets thrown out the window as the film simply piles one crisis on top of another, undermining its own atmospherics and momentum.
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
The Queen of Black Magic is a masterclass of mounting dread, with the situation becoming worse and worse for the characters until it builds into a climax that is literally hellish.
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
The new Queen of Black Magic is very much its own thing. An incredibly brutal thing at that-though its many creepy-crawly and splattery flourishes help propel a story that lays the groundwork for some excellent twists and turns.
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
The Queen of Black Magic is a 99-minute nightmare factory with a jet-black soul.
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
Director Kimo Stamboel is clearly most invested at the set-piece level, where he serves up a giddy mixture of raw fear and extravagant bloodletting.

It's because of the attention the film gives to its characters that makes everything feel as if it actually matters. With The Queen of Black Magic, Shudder adds another layered and frightening film to its impressive arsenal.

The Queen Of Black Magic is the goriest and quite possibly the most disturbing film of 2020, so far, and I mean that in the most affectionate way possible.
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
Usually when one tries to get by simply through gross and ugly, invariably it has little else to offer. The Queen of Black Magic has plenty of that to go around but manages to achieve a constant state of dread until it finally just explodes into madness.
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
A modern Gothic tale in which the past returns to violently haunt the present, touching on the corrosive powers of patriarchy and lasting damage of secrets.

The meaner it gets, the more you care, and The Queen of Black Magic earns every twist of the knife.
 "
The Queen of Black Magic,90,80,critic,"
The Queen of Black Magic is not a spin-off of The Conjuring, but it's the wildest, most splattery spin-off of The Conjuring that I've ever seen.

Caged,43,33,audience,I was confused about what type of movie it was supposed to be. The plot is just a guy stuck in a cell and tortured by a bitter woman. Complete waste of time. It didn't even end with a conclusion.
Caged,43,33,audience,"A rather boring film that kept me on screen due to the fact that the film takes place in prison and also due to whether the imprisoned person actually killed his wife or not. But that's all there is to this film good. As for the film effects and the story itself, it's a big disaster. An interesting idea, but unfortunately poorly implemented, which is a great pity. Otherwise, it could be a good movie, but unfortunately it didn't happen and the film became more of a boring spectacle, which I wished for a while to end."
Caged,43,33,audience,I'm excited to see this
Caged,43,33,audience,I was extremely surprised on how much I enjoyed this movie. The story and directing was amazing. It had a great cast that I recognized almost every actor (including Jan from the Office!).
Caged,43,33,critic,"
The problem is it spends so much time dragging these things out that by the time you get to the resolution, you kinda just don't care one way or the other.
 "
Caged,43,33,critic,"
Melodramatic and more than a little overwrought, this nerve-jangling prison drama has a vividly theatrical style that plays up pulp-style grit along with almost fantastical psychological touches.
 "
Caged,43,33,critic,"
Gathegi gives it his all, but the film that surrounds him is regrettably uninterested in offering either narrative novelty or thematic clarity.
 "
Caged,43,33,critic,"
Caged is most effective when it's focused on Harlow's paranoiac certainty that nobody on the outside of his cell cares for, or even really sees what he's going through.
 "
Caged,43,33,critic,"
It's competently acted and its mission is understood, but Fjellman doesn't provide a strong enough reason to make the journey with him, as much of ""Caged"" seems constructed to satisfy the helmer, not viewers.
 "
Caged,43,33,critic,"
For its searing look at mental deterioration in solitary confinement and ingrained racism in the prison system, Caged is an absolute must-watch, minor flaws and all.
 "
Caged,43,33,critic,"
A fairly run-of-the-mill tale from ""inside,"" distinguished by its myopic, paranoid setting and inmate's-eye-view of his shrunken world, and by a sharp cracking-up turn by Edi Gathegi

PG: Psycho Goreman is a real genre film that is made for festivals. Most of the Cast and the crew, for that matter, are rather unknown but all of them did a great job. You'll notice in the VFX and effects that this is a real low budget film ( some aspects could even be considered as trashy ) but that's were its going for. It doesn't want to take itself too seriously and thats fantastic. Its real art in a way. And it's just utterly ridiculous and absurd what makes it so good."

Psycho Goremanis a labour of love that's a joy to watch because it wears its silliness, its heart and its splatstick on its sleeve with unapologetic glee.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
From the opening crawl to the musical finale, Psycho Goreman is a riotous slice of pure escapism.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
With the exception of some guff about love, it has no vast and ponderous subtext, no serious points and instead, a proliferation of special effects and spectacle. PG: Psycho Goreman is deliberately daft.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
At its best, PG: Psycho Goreman feels like a collision between the more anarchic strains of Canadian children's television, the TV Guide description of E.T. ... and one of those splatterific R-rated Italian fantasy epics from the early '80s.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
Psycho Goreman takes good practical effects and mixes them with a 80s B-horror, sci-fi, and a little bit of heart for an enjoyable mix.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
A film about kids and alien monsters, but this is no Scooby-Doo. Psycho Goreman is ludicrous, bloody, very entertaining, and with superb special effects.

An INSANE ride! Definitely not for everyone. It certainly went too far at times for me, but I was also laughing out loud for most of the runtime.

I can easily imagine PG: Psycho Goreman becoming a cult film favorite with its quotable lines, an imaginative cast of fantastical characters, and irreverent attitude.
 "

The movie's ability to flirt with the familiar and completely turn it on its head is what keeps Psycho Goreman so perversely fresh and fun throughout.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
The promising logline is mostly squandered with the execution.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
A clever but schlocky horror/comedy/sci-fi film that spoofs some of those extremely bloody and camp '90s exploitation and absurdist genre films.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
If you don't have a mental backlog of the retro pop culture being riffed on, this film's convoluted joke may completely pass you by. But for those who can grok, it's an instant minor classic of deliberate bad taste.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
Ridiculous, juvenile, and indulgently gross, but it also has the low-budget, psychotronic eccentricity of a feature made for an audience of one.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
PG: Psycho Goreman is an uneven film that has some fun to it, but it's not all great.

Psycho Goreman is not great, but you're not gonna tell it to frig off either.
 "

The best part of it all is that it knows what it is, an over-the-top Midnight Movie, with no interest in character development or the like. Leave that for Scorsese.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
""Psycho Goreman"" is a hilarious gut-buster in every sense of the term.
 "

This gory satire of '80s and '90s kids films pulls at the heartstrings before ripping them out and eating them for breakfast.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
Psycho Goreman is this joyous blend of absurdly bloody horror, awesome makeup effects, and laugh out loud humor.
 "
PG: Psycho Goreman,90,62,critic,"
Psycho Goreman takes the charm of 80s B movie fare (Rawhead Rex, Monster Squad) and plants its feet firmly the era. Unapologetically even. The title character is the most straight forward, promising global domination. And we buy every second of it.

Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,audience,"I liked the acting and the surprise elements but it was overall a mediocre thriller, kind of slow burn. Forgettable but entertaining to see what's going to happen next."
Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,audience,"A gripping and intense thriller with a unique plot and big twists. Don't Tell a Soul is a great film owing to its pace, performances and highly satisfactory conclusion. It's definitely worth watching and recommended."
Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,audience,"I know the reviews are mostly negative but it's a pretty fun RIDICULOUS movie! I love horror/thrillers and this is a fun one. There's lots of twists and turns. Watched this with my mom, we had a good time guessing the next twists. Is it realistic, highly memorable, or to be taken seriously? No. But it's a good time for a night in."
Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,audience,"Very dark, very suspenseful, weird, and deeply unsatisfying. Quite good until the last act (that's why the extra star-would have been half a star) which is too many twisty things that make no sense in terms of human behavior, one of them being the filmmaker paints the burgeoning of a psychopath through the entire film and then tries to make him a sympathetic character in the last couple minutes. It absolutely doesn't work, along with most everything else. Like basically everyone growing into psychopathy. This filmmaker seems to see the world much like the horror writer Richard Laymon, who wrote every character besides the protagonist as a psychopath. Every single person. If the world were really like Laymon's, or this guy's, there'd be fifty violent crimes a day in a town of 400."
Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,audience,I LOVED the twists!  Great acting.  Watch this - better then other movies out now.
Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,audience,My favorite one yet.
Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,audience,Powerful.  The acting was excellent.  A great film.  McAuley is someone to watch.
Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,audience,I kinda find it hard to believe someone would be that unsympathetic. It got to the point that no one in the world is as big of a dick as the oldest brother 2.3. And the younger brother was sooooooooooooooo stupid . I don’t have a great vocabulary but dumber than stupid 
Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,audience,A really good movie from start to finish.  It keeps you hanging on and surprises you at every turn.  It gets really dark.  Dwight from the Office really fits his part.  One of the best movies Ive seen so far this year.

Bleak drama.

I applaud McAulay's efforts, but Don't Tell a Soul is at its best when it's simply having fun as a silly B-flick. Shut your brain off, enjoy - and, like with any guilty pleasure, don't tell a soul you liked it.
 "
Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,critic,"
Writer/director Alex McAulay's mean-spirited, mud-caked, scungy thriller, ""Don't Tell a Soul,"" gets a boost from an uncharacteristically scary Rainn Wilson.
 "

As lean and mean as they come, this sharp, emotional thriller is centered on just four characters and a couple of spare locations, and yet it wryly uncoils a surprising number of shocks and layers.

Don't Tell a Soul,69,58,critic,"
Despite an intriguing premise and committed performances, it lacks the character depth and moral complexity to maintain consistent suspense.

As for Wilson, he fits effortlessly into this equation as the proxy father upon whom Matt can inflict his one sense of revenge against his late dad, and in whom Joey finds something like parental approval.

This is a film that is all about connection, not just between parent and child but aiming to bridge the gap between the way those with nonspeaking autism perceive the world and the way that they, in turn, are perceived by the neurotypical.
 "
The Reason I Jump,98,80,critic,"
I enjoyed this film as far as its entertainment content goes, but as far as journalism goes, I think it falls short since it embraces some controversial beliefs as facts in a very uncritical way.

The film repeatedly emphasizes sensory details, at turns utilizing heightened sounds, a hyper-zoomed focus on specific visual cues, and even shots that try to stimulate one's sense of touch.

Hasta los confines de la Tierra es una película que acompaña a Yoko, una joven reportera japonesa y su equipo durante la filmación de un documental de viajes para al TV japonesa en Uzbekistán, en el corazón de Asia Central. La película sorprende a cada rato con las inesperadas peripecias de la protagonista y con sus cambios de registro, sin perder nunca su coherencia.

Abstract English
To the Ends of the Earth is a film that accompanies Yoko, a young Japanese reporter and her team during the filming of a travel documentary for Japanese TV in Uzbekistan, in the heart of Central Asia. The film surprises at all times with the unexpected adventures of the protagonist and with the changes of her register, without ever losing her coherence.
------------------------
Reseña Español

Yoko, una joven reportera japonesa (Atsuko Maeda, actriz y cantante pop) y su equipo recorren Uzbekistán para un programa de viajes de la TV japonesa.

La película de Kishoyi Kurosawa tiene bastante de inclasificable. Es un drama, pero con momentos de comedia, algunos de ellos perturbadores, con Yoko pasando por varias situaciones incómodas y a veces insólitas. Hasta los confines… es una película impredecible que sorprende a cada rato con los avatares de su protagonista, con sus consiguientes y necesarios cambios de registro. A pesar de ello, la película conserva su coherencia de principio a fin, en parte por la figura de su protagonista, frágil pero curiosa y resuelta.

Ciertos choques culturales, las diferencias de criterio con su equipo, su férreo y tenaz profesionalismo, las vocaciones postergadas y los sueños de Yoko se suman a un registro casi documental de las exóticas locaciones por las que transitan que nunca cae en el pintoresquismo.
---------------------------
English Review
Yoko, a young Japanese reporter (Atsuko Maeda, actress and pop singer) and her team travel to Uzbekistan for a Japanese TV travel program.

Kishoyi Kurosawa's film is quite unclassifiable. It's a drama, but with moments of comedy, some of them disturbing, with Yoko going through various awkward and sometimes unusual situations. Up to the End ... is an unpredictable film that surprises at all times with the vicissitudes of the protagonist of it, with the consequent and necessary changes of registry of her. Despite this, the film retains its coherence from beginning to end, in part because of the figure of her protagonist, fragile but curious and determined.

Certain cultural clashes, the differences of opinion with her team, her iron and tenacious professionalism, the postponed vocations and Yoko's dreams add to an almost documentary record of the exotic locations through which they pass that never falls into the picturesqueness."
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,audience,"Take one part character study, one part campy comedy (although that may have been unintentional) and a whole vat full of schmaltz and you've got one searing mess of a movie. This Japanese offering about a clueless TV reporter for a cheesy travel show doing segments about life in Uzbekistan has more changes of mood and plot than Baskin-Robbins has flavors. Between her uncanny knack for perpetually failing at her work and finding herself in the wrong parts of town, a compelling but largely inexplicable urge to free a penned-up goat, her seemingly underwhelming romantic feelings for her boyfriend back home (except when it really counts), and an underdeveloped (and somewhat indifferent) attitude toward wanting to fulfill her ambition of becoming a singer, you've got dear, sweet, shrill, naive Yoko (Atsuko Maeda), who has no meaningful or apparent direction in her life (even though she always seems to feel the need to fearfully run wherever it is she's trying to go at the moment). It's pure, unadulterated ambling from start to finish. If anyone can tell me what director Kiyoshi Kurosawa was going for here, please explain it to me."
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,audience,"Sometimes you just have to chalk it down to: I just don't get it and move on. Kiyoshi Kurosawa's 2019 film, now streaming on MUBI, would have passed me by if not for the favourable reviews it has received; and even though I don't consider it a bad film or a badly made one, I did find it oddly composed, truncated and a tad pretentious. Atsudo Maeda, a member of a highly successful J-pop girl-band in real life, plays a timid, fish-out-of-water reporter, who dreams of being a singer, but instead finds herself many miles away from home in Uzbekistan filming a travel program. Confronted and challenged by culture shock and language barriers, she is further humiliated and exploited by her production team led by an indifferent director. Made to commemorate the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relationship between Uzbekistan and Japan, the locals are decently depicted, as expected, and it might be of some interest as a travelogue film. Otherwise, the mix of mild comedy and twee drama (involving her getting lost, twice! and getting into trouble with the police while chasing a cat!), and her Japanese cover of Edith Piaf's Hymne a l'Amour, is simply baffling and lost on me. So instead, I'll return to two of those reviews that got me here: Mark Schilling of The Japan Times called Madea a ""lonely-but-intrepid heroine"" – but I think she's more insipid than intrepid; while Hollywood Reporter's Neil Young wrote, ""Officially endorsed international co-productions are usually stilted, self-consciously didactic affairs; the seasoned but adventurous hands of Kurosawa, however, here yield quietly immersive and spellbinding results."" – of which I can wholeheartedly endorse the first half, but I've detected no evidence of the second."
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
A mesmerizing movie about isolation, real or perceived, and how it can warp our perceptions. When it finally connects with the audience, it does so in a big way.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
An idiosyncratic tale of being culturally adrift, To the Ends of the Earth is a great movie to watch to close out a strange year.

Kiyoshi Kurosawa conjures an atmosphere of humorous dislocation and acute fear with To the Ends of the Earth...

A film that intrigues and amazes. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
That To the Ends of the Earth is a state-sanctioned attempt at commemorating diplomacy makes its artistry that much more impressive.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
Writer-director Kiyoshi Kurosawa has made an indie-film star of the charming Atsuko Maeda. It's a journey into the Uzbekistan of your mind.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
Best known for his paranormal dramas, Kurosawa has made a thoughtful, gentle movie about cultural divides, tourist disorientation, and a young woman's realization of her potential.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
More than any film before it, To the Ends of the Earth fully embodies the isolation of culture shock.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
It's a history lesson, yes, but it's also a lesson in basic humanity.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
The search for authentic experiences in our over-mediated age can be an elusive one, almost as slippery as this provocative mood piece.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
Aside from Maeda's multifaceted lead performance and a few compelling sequences, the film feels somewhat lightweight.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
This lovely character study of a young woman finding herself while lost in a foreign land was commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Japan and Uzbekistan and Kurosawa's found a beautiful way to do it.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
A penetrating portrait of the pitfalls of modern life-but Kurosawa should have ditched the imitation Sound of Music finale.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
To the Ends of the Earth"" raises consciousness of outsiders and appreciation of what truly makes life worthwhile.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
Part fish-out-of-water comedy, part media satire, part feminist manifesto, To the Ends of the Earth  is a quiet wonder of a film, a perceptive and lyrical interrogation of alienation and loneliness that lands like a depth charge.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
To the Ends of the Earth is an astutely observed study, one with an exceptionally keen eye on the spectator's relationship to this character and the world she finds herself lost in.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
A movie where gorgeously lit and framed exterior photography, as well as consummately precise body-language-centric performances, often convey more than most dialogue could.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
A film that blends fantasy and musical elements into the mix with such grace that one barely notices the transition.
 "
To the Ends of the Earth,95,50,critic,"
Kurosawa's command of film form gives the movie an embracing magnetism despite its seeming thinness of plot.
 "
Girl With No Mouth,60,,critic,"
This is a quirky, often sensitive adventure movie, an oddly warm take on a dystopian setting where the dystopia could almost be totally excised.
 "
Girl With No Mouth,60,,critic,"
The sort of half-baked postmodern fantasy where child actors meander around a few dilapidated interiors and sunny exteriors, and only talk vaguely about their character-defining traumas.
 "
Girl With No Mouth,60,,critic,"
It's a wildly unusual tone the film hits, but it never misses.
 "
Girl With No Mouth,60,,critic,"
A pointless parable and survivalist tale with no real goal or destination.
 "
Girl With No Mouth,60,,critic,"
On the one hand, a parable of corporate greed and exploitation, and of society's treatment of the disabled or ""deficient"", and on the other a story of the way we all reinvent ourselves precisely through story

What Lies Below,64,55,audience,"I felt like i watched a more ""mature"" episode of ""Goosebumps""!! I really enjoyed it !"
What Lies Below,64,55,audience,"The build up to the climax of this film is well crafted and quite tense. We go from following a socially awkward 16year old who seems to have a crush on her mother's new boyfriend to hoping the sleeze ball mother's boyfriend gets his comeuppance. The ending is a little less well done than the rest of the film. Expectation is that the young girl will either be saved by the police or get to safety, however in a very quick twist she finds herself just another victim with No explanation to the ending ..did she die , did she survive , did anyone react to her missing best friend last seen dead at her house , did the police respond to the help me my step dad is going to kill me calls... So many loose ends at the end that spoil a quite enjoyable SCI FI thriller. ..."
What Lies Below,64,55,audience,"RT is my go to site for reviews. Pretty much the only game in town. I trust that I can usually get a good idea of a movie before I watch it. Often the ratings are way off from what I would give a picture, not surprisingly, but this one sits perfectly at 60%. Not a bad sci-fi creature feature, with a memorably odd performance by Trey Tucker."
What Lies Below,64,55,audience,This movie is weird and confusing but also tantalizing and intriguing. It's worth watching and will entertain you.
What Lies Below,64,55,audience,"There are many flaws,yes. But this isn't a horrible watch."
What Lies Below,64,55,audience,"Movie kept me interested and then the ending sucked, it was horrible. "
What Lies Below,64,55,audience,I thought it was pretty entertaining! Love a good Science Fiction
What Lies Below,64,55,audience,Was on my toes all movie wondering who this guy was and what the intentions were and WTF was going to happen. Very creepy mystery. Not scary to me.  CREEPY.  I liked the acting and story. Wasn't overly happy with the ending chosen but overall thumbs up.
What Lies Below,64,55,audience,"People are nuts on here! This may not be a 5 star movie, but it is definitely, DEFINITELY NOT a 1 star movie. Personally, I thought it was a bit slow, but once it got going, I LOVED IT. So creepy. Plenty of suspense. Highly recommend!"
What Lies Below,64,55,audience,Damn. People are really mad at this film. I really liked it though. I love the ending and I think it fits.
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
Small scale mystery horror with big ideas. It may not look like much at first, but the payoff is worthwhile.
 "
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
Has echoes of both Species and Sleepwalkers, told as if it were a forgotten Goosebumps story.
 "
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
The denouement when it comes is meant to be shriek of pure sci-fi horror; but really, you'd find better entertainment - and more energetic acting - watching a fish tank.
 "
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
What Lies Below may be rough around the edges but it certainly has a lot of fun parts to sink into.
 "
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
What Lies Below is a movie that looks like it ran out of ideas, money and talent halfway through it's production. Utterly forgettable and unless you collect bad movies that aren't any fun to watch, one to avoid.
 "
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
What Lies Below offers a twist on two underrated sub-genres, but its identity crisis causes this aquatic horror creature feature to sink, not swim.
 "
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
Mostly thanks to the oddball performance of Trey Tucker as the mysterious John Smith, What Lies Below really works as a sexy, sci-fi thriller that definitely has a will to be weird.
 "
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
What Lies Below mostly coasts on its never-fully exploited main scenario: what would you do if an attractive eccentric tried to be your stepfather?
 "
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
Well produced thriller with a generally trashy side to it if you're in the mood, and some legitimate interest in the actual science of its science fiction.
 "
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
Weird but well-done, What Lies Below is not even close to the worst thriller I've seen this year.
 "
What Lies Below,64,55,critic,"
'What Lies Below' teases a lusty thriller with more below the surface, but sinks in its third act.

Buddy Games,17,71,audience,"A ton of laughs. Brash, imaginative and really funny. What more do you want?!!!"
Buddy Games,17,71,audience,"Look, this movie caters to a specific audience. The audience willing to check their brain at the door, dial back the screening of what's socially acceptable, and embrace the absurdity of boys being boys (into middle age). It's a fun movie (if you let it be), but if you're a person caught up in being politically correct, you're gonna hate it as much as the critics. Cheers to Josh Duhamel for directing this gem. Pop a cold one and/or smoke a fat one and let yourself laugh."
Buddy Games,17,71,audience,"Critically it was dreadful, but when my brain tunes out and I can connect with the performers rather than the work, that's where the fun of Buddy Games really begins."
Buddy Games,17,71,audience,terrible movie.  It seriously seemed like this was an attempt for some b list actors to try and replicate the semi success that the grownups movies have done but with even  worse writing.
Buddy Games,17,71,audience,"This is a very funny movie, kind of in the tradition of Animal House or Old School. I haven’t laughed this much in a while. "
Buddy Games,17,71,audience,Truly a god awful movie that is slow and poorly written. Instead of just being funny it tries to be dramatic and it makes the movie so much worse. 
Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
This oppressively unfunny flick feels like the product of a bet to turn Jackass into fiction, to make it as awful and obnoxious as possible, and to give Duhamel both a cruisy filmmaking credit and the easiest on-screen role of his career.

Buddy Games is sexist, homophobic and desperate for a laugh. It never gets one.

Obnoxious ""bro"" comedy is both funny and problematic.

Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
There's a lot to be repulsed by here: it's hard to know where to start.
 "
Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
Sexism and homophobia rule in this repellent comedy about ""boys just being boys.""
 "
Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
Buddy Games is an instance where the actors probably had more fun making the film than audiences will watching it.
 "
Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
Don't bother playing.
 "
Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
To call Buddy Games moronic, idiotic or even asinine, would be an insult to morons, idiots or asses, who are also likely the movie's target audience.
 "
Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
Picking the worst part of ""Buddy Games"" is like choosing meat at a Brazilian steakhouse. There are so many options, and they just keep on coming.
 "
Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
That the film is spectacularly unfunny doesn't seem to stop the production, which is determined to whiff with simple goals, seemingly obsessed to reach the bottom of the barrel when it comes to ideas for silly business.
 "
Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
A tortured, dim, and unbearably neurotic comedy about five self-styled alpha males.
 "
Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
It's a dumber, more vulgar, and less funny version of 2018's Tag.
 "
Buddy Games,17,71,critic,"
If you share my proclivity for juvenile humor executed by idiot man-children, you'll probably find something to like here. If you don't, feel free to take a pass; for you, when it comes to Buddy Games, the only way to win is not to play.

You could do a lot worse than spend 90 minutes watching ""Buddy Games."" You could do better, too.

Jiu Jitsu,27,73,audience,"Cleary the director thought that packing this movie with terrible cliches, confusing shaky cam fight sequences, and Nic Cage would make up for its complete lack of plot. The director was wrong."
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,audience,Super cool action movie!
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,audience,"So, I'm thinking......""It's $6.99 and has Nic Cage in a ""Cagienesque"" role..what could go wrong?""

All of it.  It's incomprehensibly bad.  Like, unwatchable after drinking tequila alone on a Saturday night bad.  

To review this in any depth is to simply give it power and energy which might make it live longer.  Which it shouldn't since it's not even a grade-B movie.  It's just awful.

The fight scenes are some of the worst of all time unless you're maybe a 6 year old on either a sugar high or some steep withdrawals from all the sugar built up in your system and you're just sitting there...shuddering and hoping for your binky or maybe a stuffed unicorn but instead your forced to watch this unholy offering.  

I have no clue how this was filmed...it couldn't have been storeyboarded or planned out since it's a jumble of absolutely non-sensical scenes mashed together.  I have no clue how it was financed ( although kudos to Cage for a paycheck) since most people value their money enough to NOT invest in something so righteously terrible.  

Everyone involved in this should pray to anyone and anything for whatever salvation awaits them in the next life because any good karma they had just evaporated from being part of this ....""film""."
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,audience,"It's so bad that it could be goo...... wait, no, actually it's just bad. Trying to do too much stuff : martial art, explosion, aliens. And the main character... jeez he was the worst even if the rest of the casting is pretty good."
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,audience,"I was forced into watching this with some friends and I cannot stress enough how close to torture it was. I felt as if this movie committed several war crimes for being so horrible, and I thought of suing them on multiple occasions for the mental damage that it has done.

Please for the love of god do anything else with your life than watch this movie. Literally take on a hobby like knitting or pilates, anything else that you do will be better than watching this disaster.

You're welcome."
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,audience,"Sweet Jesus! what did I just watch...?! This is one part Predator and two parts magic mushrooms. It's mostly a mishmash of nonsense. There's a great cast of action icons, but they're lost in a convoluted mess of half-baked, but interesting ideas. The comic book editing was pretty cool though."
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,audience,"I saw Jiu Jitsu (a great martial art) , Nicolas Cage and aliens so I expected a great movie. However I couldn't stand it for more than 30 minutes : Weird acting, very bad editing and filming (even Youtubers can do better)...Don't waste your time with it guys."
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,audience,90% of the film are poorly choreographed combats with cheap 90's synthetiser music. A new low for Cage who was the only reason I rented that movie🙄
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,audience,"Omg it predator without the actors, story or cinematography. Nicolas Cage should roll over in his grave for doing this pile of crapola ( if not already dead it time he committed ritual suicide)

Thank god I used Google credit to purchase this steaming pile of horse manure"
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,audience,"must watch, so bad that its very funny"
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
A bit more plot and a better villain would have been nice, though martial arts fans and followers of Nicholas Cage and Tony Jaa should have a pretty good time
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
Indebted to arcade fighting hits that prize complicated button-mashing combos over serious characterizations and drama.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
Jiu Jitsu might have found a cult following, if only it had been released 24 or 30 or 36 years ago. In 2021 it feels out of time and place, another Nicolas Cage vehicle stuck in the mud, spinning its wheels.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
Feels like warmed-over Predator with high kicks and samurai swords.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
Only time will tell if Jiu Jitsu will achieve Showgirls-type cult status for its breathtaking badness but make no mistake: it's baaad.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
At the ends, I fully threw my hands up. It makes no sense...
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
I couldn't tell how anything connected to ANYTHING...
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
The action scenes were almost just as much nonsense as the story line. This is far from the bad but good Cage films we've come to willfully endure over the years.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
A lot of crazy things have happened in 2020, but the craziest in a cinematic sense has to be Jiu Jitsu starring the one and only Nicolas Cage.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
It's so much that it all starts to blur in your mind and so much that you completely lose track of the story and who the characters are meant to be.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
The action sequences are weirdly extended and bland, like game-play action from a first-person game.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
A bland and confusing film that plays against its obvious fun factors, creating a rather dull action movie that won't stick in your memory for long.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
However, as soon as Cage enters the arena the whole thing begins to fall apart. The action gets sloppy and repetitive. The script gets even more ridiculous.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
For Cage completists and fans of '80s action, it's worth a shot, but Jiu Jitsu is a hash of badly managed ideas, technical flaws and Predator rip-offs.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
Jiu Jitsu is nonsense, but action fans will be satiated by a talented cast kicking butt across fairly nondescript landscapes.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
A few fun fights notwithstanding, this kitschy B-movie is undermined by both its embarrassingly cheap visual effects and the disappointingly scant presence of Nicolas Cage.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
Nicolas Cage as a paper-hat-wearing hermit and martial artist Tony Jaa as a warrior who must have traveled back in time to raid Chess King for his wardrobe. What's not to love?
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
With its preposterous story, bizarre action sequences, and performances in wildly varying pitches, this action movie is, at best, a candidate for so-bad-it's good status.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
While Cage finally appears about 40 minutes into the film as an eccentric expert swordsman who makes paper hats in his spare time, the levity of his very presence provides some measure of a relief.
 "
Jiu Jitsu,27,73,critic,"
This is the kind of badass sci-fi film you would expect Nic Cage to be in and sure enough he's in it.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,audience,The movie is terrible the effects are so fake that made The movie look ridiculous. The pro Chinese confrontation to the world is worse that the Bruce Lee movies. Terrible
Vanguard,29,50,audience,"I had to cut the film off an hour in, felt too much like an off-brand Taken, and I am no fan of that series.
 Felt like Chan was attempting to pass the torch to his co-stars here, but that failed.
 The goofy action was entertaining once upon a time , but it wanes here with way too much CGI to make anything here memorable.
 I wanted to catch this when it dropped in theaters, I am glad I missed out."
Vanguard,29,50,audience,What a great movie. Jackie Chan. 66 years older. The acting was a bit AAA but this was really enjoyable. He looks like he’s still in his 20s. The ending monologue was touching especially during Covid. Great job Jackie!!!!
Vanguard,29,50,audience,"One of the most boring movie I have ever seen. Poor acting, poor scripts and poor cgi."
Vanguard,29,50,audience,"From this movie, got the feeling of ""Who am I"". Overall quite good and Jackie Chan's style movie, also the traditional formula."
Vanguard,29,50,audience,Good Movie but needed English subtitles in a lot of parts and there weren't any at my theater.
Vanguard,29,50,audience,"Amazing that Jackie Chan is still risking his life to create movies for us. This is what I call a popcorn movie, nonstop action from start to finish. It's a bit like Fast and Furious. Only thing I didn't like was the CGI."
Vanguard,29,50,audience,is this a comedy?...
Vanguard,29,50,audience,"great action scenes, not a bad script, definitely wanting for sequel."
Vanguard,29,50,audience,"Terrible CGI. All the signature car chasing scenes were replaced by the terrible CGI. Weak plot, and bad acting by some of the actors and actress."
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
In most respects, Vanguard feels like a throwback to the type of overstuffed action flick that made its presence particularly known from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
""Vanguard"", as was always the case with HK action movies, does not stand up to logic. However, both Stanley Tong and Jackie Chan seem to acknowledge, cherish and thrive on this fact, a concept that is quite obvious in the whole duration of the film
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
Although an outtake shown in the closing credits proves Chan is still willing to take risks, the film's use of CGI largely denies us the physical realism that was a hallmark of his movies in the old days.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
Supercop? Super-bland.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
It's an unforgivable waste of Jackie Chan, action-movie legend, reduced here to pratfalls and gurning double takes.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
It's all atrocious.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
Veteran Hong Kong action director Stanley Tong reunites with his longtime star Jackie Chan for this amiable but rather under-par adventure with silly CGI effects.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
Vanguard is a horrifyingly fake action blockbuster that is monotonous, labourious and bereft of any charm and wit expected from the talents of Jackie Chan and Stanley Tong.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
'Vanguard' features Jackie Chan ... and not much else.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
Director/writer Stanley Tong and topliner Jackie Chan have made something that feels like one of those big, splashy international derring-do actioners from the '70s and '80s.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
For audiences perfectly happy to ignore a basic plot in exchange for some spectacular action.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
Don't come in expecting vintage Chan action, and you'll get your money's worth.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
Jackie Chan is still agile but this movie just limps along from comedy to drama, never knowing which side to choose.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
Towards the end of the film there's a wild ride through a Dubai shopping mall, but I'd venture a guess that most viewers will never make it that far through this stinker.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
There's no reason why a movie that features Jackie Chan, lion attacks, and machete-wielding henchmen on Jet Skis should be as boring as Vanguard.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
Chan's globetrotting action movie features a few brief, impressive car chases and other light moments, but it's largely weighed down by poor writing, bland villains, and a nonsensical plot.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
I was just floored by how confidently they moved.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
Overall it was a really really fun package... but I really, really would have liked to have seen more martial arts stuff Jackie Chan stuff, fun goofy martial arts action.
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
As a time passer, die hard Chan fans will probably still find enough, and even if the main man himself feels a little off, there's an overriding sense of fun and vim from the younger cast
 "
Vanguard,29,50,critic,"
This movie defies genre not by seamlessly blending, but by jarringly overstuffing - forget scene by scene, you barely know what kind of movie you're watching minute by minute.
 "
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,audience,"Perfectly fine for what it is.

'The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special' is OK, not necessarily good or bad. A couple of the actors carry over from the 'Star Wars' franchise itself, though the vast majority of main stars from the aforementioned do not. The plot is split three ways in terms of how I enjoyed them.

The best stuff, for me, is the bits with Palpatine and Darth Vader, Trevor Devall undoubtedly gives the best voice performance as the former. The parts with Rey, who is voiced unconvincingly and borderline irritatingly by Helen Sadler, is watchable. Lastly, the stuff with Finn & Co. is uninteresting filler.

On Sadler's story in this, I did enjoy seeing them go back through the films from the main  franchise - though I would've liked it more if they did it in a more clever and amusing way, à la 'The Lion King 1½' with the Pride Rock scene.

At just 44mins and with the nessacary - if not a great deal of - festive vibe, it's practically impossible to dislike this... at least for me. It's also light years ahead of its 1978 predecessor, not that that's difficult mind."
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,audience,Did not like it at all what a waste of time watch the Mandalorian instead
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,audience,Once of those things you'd watch only after zapping all other channels to see if something better is on.
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,audience,"I can't make my mind up which was worse, this film or my vasectomy? I rather suspect this film."
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,audience,"The marketing poster for this film was so good that I almost feel like it's my fault for getting tricked into watching it (a poster of Luke's hand gift wrapped and sent from Vader for Christmas? Hilarious). Given that marketing for some reason I assumed ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" was going to be an official full budget Lego film, and it would clearly be spoofing the original holiday special full of all sorts of crazy hilarious antics. Instead what I got was... a straight to tv-style Holiday Special of Star Wars. Technically they didn't promise any more from the title, but I still felt played somehow when I discovered that they were taking the plot totally seriously. I mean, the movie wasn't even really funny, and what's the point of making a Lego Star Wars Holiday Special if it isn't going to be FUNNY? Maybe you can chalk that up to missed expectations, but I just thought the film was an ""okay"" way to waste your kid's time. Not anything I would remotely recommend to an adult."
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,audience,"What can I say of this new Lego movie🤔? Its entertaining to see again all characters of the trilogies before, Prequel and Original characters and a good easter egg of the Mandalorian🥰👍!! But honestly, the story was fade and dumb😏, because of Rey🙄!! Rey is the worst character of Star wars stories, because she's a fucking Deus ex Machina and a Mary Sue again, she's ashamed the characters before and she dare being a master Jedi with a dumb character like Finn (Finn is not force sensitive and not a future Jedi). She's more powerful than any others characters of the trilogies before and just 'cause she reading  jedis texts she can able to do everything she want with the Force, a big disgrace😤😠!! And the Holiday, just fade with the worst characters of the Sequel, from Disney, is not surprising 😒!! But the principle to triped in time with magical crystals is incredible, because even if this film is dumb, this is the proof that Star wars can be a great crossover of all time😍🥰😇!! The Prequel and Original characters with Mandalorian world too, with greats planets of the saga will be possible in the future of Disney/Lucasfilm😍😍🥰😇, but not with the Sequel characters never🥱😠!! But I pray the day 🙏 of this great crossover!! My conclusion of this film : the film is fade with the Sequel characters😏👎, but the principal of this crossover is great🤩🤩, so a mixed review !!"
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,audience,"It wasn't great, but not awful either. There is some clever and well done callbacks to the franchise, but the time travel plot is predictable and some of the humor falls flat. It's much better than the other Holiday Special, even thought that's not a very high bar to pass. Recommended to casual fans as a self parody and you may slightly enjoy it, but don't expect to watch a classic."
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,audience,MASTERPIECE. Part of me wishes this was canon!!
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,audience,"This was worse than the 1978 Star Wars Special. I usually love lego movies too but this was terrible. So bad, I couldn't even finish it."

Collecting all phases of the Star Wars cinematic universe into one animated space is fun but the best parts are the inside jokes at the franchise's own expense.

The good news is The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special is a step up from The Star Wars Holiday Special. But, then again, almost everything is.

Overall, LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special is quite fun and a pleasant distraction from everything going on in the world, particularly for fans of the franchise.

'The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special' doesn't feature anybody who has ever appeared on 'The Love Boat.' That, my fellow Star Wars fans, is perhaps the best Life Day gift of all.

... the special is obviously geared toward children, but should also be a pleasant adventure for long-time fans seeking something light during the holiday season.
 "
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,critic,"
Life Day is about family, after all, and the stories of the Star Wars movies are so deeply entangled in family. And it's a little frustrating to watch this special fail to capitalize on any of that stuff, even for the sake of a gag.
 "
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special,72,56,critic,"
The action and vivid animation is there to hold younger fans' attentions, even if they don't quite understand all the Star Wars references, but it's those references and attention to visual detail that we adults will appreciate.

The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special is a sweet little self-deprecating romp around the galaxy that pays homage to trilogies both old and new.

It's not a new classic, but it's nice that Star Wars fans finally have something watchable to put on during the holiday season.

SLEEPLESS BEAUTY breaks a cardinal sin, which is making the viewer ask themselves why should they care about what's happening...

Kindred,70,54,audience,This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Smh.. I'm actually speechless at how terrible this movie was. Watching this just left me feeling like I made such a poor decision.
Kindred,70,54,audience,Downton Abbey meets Rosemary's Baby in this horror that rages through aged locked doors when a pregnant woman is trapped with a white upper class country family after her boyfriend is killed. The quiet simplistic nature is a stillness that haunts this movie over traditional gore and supernatural haunts. The ghosts are the white family when a black woman is imprisoned with her boyfriends family with a soon to be newborn; still grieving the loss of her lover.
Kindred,70,54,audience,"A new psychological horror. Plagued by mysterious hallucinations, a pregnant woman suspects that the family of her deceased boyfriend has intentions for her unborn child. From the synopsis, I expected this movie to be the Am-I-crazy-or-am-I-not kind of movie. And I was not wrong. The plot of this movie was very derivative of movies of the same types, like Rosemary's Baby. However, the acting, cinematography, and execution were very good. Also, the main actress was African American while the others were all white, which gave the movie a Get Out vibe. However, the movie seemed not to focus on this aspect at all, and only on the psychological part. Also, even though the trailer made the movie like a horror, the movie itself wasn't scary at all. Overall, a well-executed psychological thriller with a plot that was done a lot before. 7/10"
Kindred,70,54,critic,"
Despite its tendency to tiptoe around some of the truly dark elements of the story, Kindred is an unsettling slow-burn featuring two powerhouse performances from Tamara Lawrance and Fiona Shaw.
 "
Kindred,70,54,critic,"
Kindred is a fascinating thriller that can't be contained.
 "
Kindred,70,54,critic,"
Never lets up on the doom, thrusting its Black female protagonist into an unfamiliar, uncaring world dominated by patriarchal values and bourgeois whiteness.
 "
Kindred,70,54,critic,"
While it's a fascinating character study, Kindred is a limp thriller.
 "
Kindred,70,54,critic,"
If not for the movie's finale, a painted-into-a-corner finish that seems needlessly cruel and inorganic to what's happened before, ""Kindred"" could be one of the great thrillers of the last year.
 "
Kindred,70,54,critic,"
Chilling psychological thriller has some gore and language.
 "
Kindred,70,54,critic,"
[Tamara] Lawrance and [Fiona] Shaw give performances that add depth to their roles ... These performances elevate the quality of Kindred, which has a lot of characteristics of being a mediocre 'woman in peril' movie that will leave some viewers cold.

Kindred is packed with significant talent, but the slow pace and tedious script leaves the audience looking for the exit before the movie gets going.
 "
Kindred,70,54,critic,"
Well acted, beautifully shot and pointlessly disturbing--the audience seems as much a victim of sadism as the main character held prisoner in a creepy, creaky country home.

Add director Joe Marcantonio's debut feature to the list of recent genre works that are actually family dramas couched in the effective framework of horror and/or thriller.

This could have been a Rosemary's Baby hybrid with some old English horror thrown in, but Kindred simply fails to measure up.
 "
Kindred,70,54,critic,"
Its co-writer/director has pulled off a rare feat: He's created a work that interrogates grief with a sociopolitical undercurrent without losing sight of the fact that this is a horror film in the first place.

An ace cast makes the most of each quietly intense scene as the tension escalates to almost unbearable levels.

Kindred has promise, but it ultimately seems self-defeatingly reluctant to embrace its own genre nature... not bad, yet its cautious good taste finally just kills the fun without providing any more substantial reward.

The narrative's insistent claustrophobia manages to frustrate expectations and allows for a trio of performances which become increasingly more uncomfortable.

Fire Will Come,92,,critic,"
This beautifully composed offering from Spanish director Oliver Laxe is a compelling, enigmatic watch.
 "
Fire Will Come,92,,critic,"
It's a fairly simple plot and one that goes exactly where you expect given the title, but Fire Will Come creates meaning through its mood and sense of place rather than its plot.

In their debut films, Amador and Benedicta suggest volumes with few words.

""Fire Will Come"" is a pithy and devastating masterstroke from an auteur astute in his calibration of subdued emotional impact. Its discourse on forgiveness simmers in one's mind inextinguishably.
 "
Fire Will Come,92,,critic,"
Fire Will Come is a beautifully shot bit of hypnotic imagery.
 "
Fire Will Come,92,,critic,"
At only 80 minutes and change, Fire Will Come is slim, distilled and as sharp as a shiv to the gut.
 "

The result is a short and elliptical tale that unfolds at the speed of life and resolves with the hopeful uncertainty of forgiveness itself.

Amador's story is unfortunately never as emotionally arresting or complex as the film's opening scene.

Fire Will Come offers no answers about the cause of the inferno, but it does show the consequences...

Cadaver,38,28,audience,"not gonna lie Netflix at the moment has made horrors that are packed full of gore just for the sake of gore and this is one of these films. I hate that. I love horror, it's literally all I watch but watching this film reminded me of why sometimes I stick to supernatural horrors.
this was recommended to me by Netflix and I figured since they know my watch history they should know what I like, it didn't start off too bad but from the get-go, I could almost tell you exactly what was going to happen. in horror, it's great to play to the troupes but if it has you knowing the whole plot of the movie before it's even begun is there even any point in watching it. 
the acting by some of the actors was great which is the only reason why I watched this movie the whole way through, and while yes the metaphor of showing how people who fit the aesthetic of looking richer or seeming richer can have people place their trust in you more especially if you're trying to help them is one that could be used more in the horror genre its also been done, in a more tactful way than this movie.
there were parts in this movie where I literally couldn't stop myself from rolling my eyes. they see someone get killed right in front of them, and then 10 seconds later oh wow their burning clothes I wonder why they would do that. 
this whole movie just spoon-feeds you the plot and there is no need for it. the ending is rushed and honestly not informative enough to get the point in why the main guy who ran this place did it. I want to help people survive or I did it for the family just had me thinking wow this guy has a savior complex. I wouldn't be convinced to join his ""family"" if that was the argument he gave, so I'm not surprised that they wrote it so that the main character didn't either but you can't convince me that the other actors that he found were convinced either.
this movie is not worth the watch if your looking for a good movie with a better but slightly similar plot just watch the purge or us."
Cadaver,38,28,audience,"mmm; it's fine. pretty typical. though, i wasn't engaged the whole entire time. i don't think i'd watch it again on purpose."
Cadaver,38,28,audience,"Pretty obvious narrative, turning into a very generic horror movie"
Cadaver,38,28,audience,This is quite underrated
Cadaver,38,28,audience,"It has impressive production values and stunning cinematography, and it aims to provide effective social commentary. However, it fails miserably, as it has a derivative and unoriginal plot, a forced an unnecessary post-apocalyptic setting, uninteresting characters, and a lack of substance and any genuinely effective scares."
Cadaver,38,28,audience,very weird and interesting this thriller is a good movie that I enjoyed.
Cadaver,38,28,audience,Wow. This movie deserves a lot more credit than it currently has. I thought it was fantastic and it really had me on the edge of my seat-- and I'm an avid horror fan. Definitely give it a chance
Cadaver,38,28,audience,"Cadaver is a Norwegian Netflix horror flick that stays with you. Although some of it has been seen before, the dark world is easy to get drawn into. Predictable twist and turns galore but watching this wouldn't be the end of the world."
Cadaver,38,28,audience,"The movie aims to hit a look on how society is being depicted with rich vs poor privilege. It was an ok movie for me but what made me feel frustrated were parts where the leading actress acts dumbly in the first half of the movie, looking for her daughter. She even had the time to fight with the husband, loudly, shouting as if they can't be heard by the enemy. It made my brain hurt for a minute watching that scene. But the ending redeemed itself but not so much."
Cadaver,38,28,audience,"This film is very good in terms of the atmosphere and all the mystery that hovers around the villain, but it loses a bit in some places that are very obvious, then there are some inaccuracies and errors in some parts of the film. My personal criticism, however, concerns the protagonist who is the woman mother of the child who is of a hateful character and an excessively flat personality and practically unbearable so much that in the end she led me to cheer for the villain"
Cadaver,38,28,critic,"
We are facing a very irregular proposal, which is much superior in everything related to the visual section -with an excellent photograph-. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Cadaver,38,28,critic,"
A timely horror movie that will get you thinking, even if the lead protagonist is frustrating to watch for most of the film.
 "
Cadaver,38,28,critic,"
If there's a biting allegory hidden somewhere in Cadaver, it's hopelessly buried under obvious plot twists and a lot of pointless to-and-fro wandering.
 "
Cadaver,38,28,critic,"
Ghoulish horror movie has graphic violence, gore.
 "
Cadaver,38,28,critic,"
Cadaver is made of ingredients that've churned stomachs before, but even with such artful performances, it's a one-note night of limited experiential starvation terror.
 "
Cadaver,38,28,critic,"
There's very little about this film to set it apart from many, many others of its ilk.
 "
Cadaver,38,28,critic,"
Gorgeous to look at...and well-played, but predictable enough to amount to a mixed bag of a thriller.
 "
Cadaver,38,28,critic,"
A little too monotonous and uninvolving to be of great solace right now.

Bad Hair,62,39,audience,"The hair in this movie is bad. Like literally, killer, bloody bad hair. A villain. 

Love the 80's vibes and the whole look and feel, from the grainy film to the music and fashion. Bad Hair tries too hard to be biting and absurd at the same time, so hard that by the time the movie ends you will thank it's finally over. Even though it gets repetitive and overly campy (which I guess it was intended to be that way), it's a fun, clever, and different take on horror/comedy with a powerful thing to say."
Bad Hair,62,39,audience,"Bad Hair is at its best when it fully leans into the ridiculousness of its own premise. Similar to Dear White People (2014), Simien has created a camp horror that will definitely create conversation. Despite several portions being weighted down with pacing issues, Bad Hair remains stylish and witty. The director lovingly pays homage to classic B Movies like Little Shop of Horrors (1986) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978). Although one would argue Simien struggles to relate to the female's perspective, his efforts are valiant and unique. He demonstrates how the most effective horrors are a reflection of the true horrors that humans bring upon themselves."
Bad Hair,62,39,audience,"Finally a horror movie that’s fresh and original. Looking forward to more from the writers, directors, actors and crew. "
Bad Hair,62,39,audience,"The concept is so kooky that you have to suspend disbelief much farther than usual, even for a supernatural horror film. Even with the crazy gag it's a really fun romp, the cast is great, and the special effects are surprisingly good when you consider that they're attempting to portray killer hair. Elle Lorraine is particularly good as the heroine, and Vanessa Williams rules in her role as the demanding producer. It's also nice to see a mostly black cast."
Bad Hair,62,39,audience,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! There were some visuals that were a bit corny but it was intentionally funny at moments so it matched that vibe. I thought the acting was great and the lead was amazing. I thought the storyline connected so well and really enjoyed the folklore. I enjoyed the strangeness and the way everything tide together. I would definitely recommend this film. It reminded me of Drag Me to Hell, but I enjoyed this one more."
Bad Hair,62,39,audience,I thought this movie was going to be good and have a hidden message to the black women who feel the need to adapt to European beauty standards but this was a joke. Her hair apparently needs to eat blood to stay untangled. When her hair ATE HER PERIOD BLOOD! That's when I stopped taking this seriously.
Bad Hair,62,39,audience,The social commentary alone gets 3 stars. Very different type of horror movie. The 1st time she gets here weave in is horror at it’s finest. 
Bad Hair,62,39,audience,"3 stars purely for effort. I loved the cast, the setting, that distinctive late 80s/early 90s vibe. It all went south when the killer weave was introduced and brought the whole thing down. Still, I'll watch anything Lena Waithe is attached to."
Bad Hair,62,39,audience,"It was horrible..
I passed this movie several times on Hulu and finally decided to watch I last night.
In my head I was thinking it was going to be a stephord wives  type deal where girls get weaves and start acting ""Caucasian"". Boy was I wrong. I prayed to several gods hoping the movie would be better by the end and sadly it did not. I was so irritated with this movie. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE"
Bad Hair,62,39,audience,"Oof, this movie was dreadful."
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
In his quest to create a fable about Black women's hair, Simien overlooks the actual function it plays in Black women's lives, opting instead for a superficial finger wag about the value and importance of natural beauty.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
BAD HAIR is successful at showing all the steps along the way to giving up what makes you special as a person to obey society's demands that you become one of the many.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
There are sparks here and there but the film mostly fails to deliver thrill or commentary in the right dose.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
Aside from the excruciating hair weave operation, and the pain that follows, I found much of this dark comedy amusing, just because it is so off-the-wall crazy.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
This undercurrent of darker humour balances the silliness of some of the hair attack scenes and ensures that the film succeeds as both horror and comedy whilst having more to say than most of what emerges from either genre.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
A Black experience film whose horror satire is good for a few laughs.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
It's a weave that has a thirst for blood. What's not fun about that?
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
Socio-politics and cultural relevance are just part of Simien's obvious admiration for horror movie heritage. Bad Hair is delightfully old school.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
Quite simply, this is a fun film with a message, and some suitably-ropey special effects that should have been made in 1989 but thankfully has finally been made in 2020.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
We liked a lot about this movie at #Sundance2020 and this final (shorter!) version is even better. A fun, campy, referential horror film about a weave with its own ambitions - #BadHair has a lot of social commentary, but has fun while saying it.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
Funny satire has social commentary, gore, sex, and language.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
There's always room for another spin of the Faustian wheel, and this clever throwback to late-'80s psycho-thrillers is a worthy addition to the field.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
The script tries too hard in some areas but not hard enough in others, but on the whole, it's a refreshing genre take on intraracial politics -- like School Daze meets The Exorcist.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
Bad Hair works as a delivery device for well-worn but effective creepshow kookiness, but its politics are muddled and faintly mean-spirited.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
Bad Hair isn't a bad movie. Few of 2020's horror pictures are, for better or for worse, this memorable. But in the end, Simien's execution doesn't match his ambitions.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
A banal, sepulchral tour through the failures of the Black male imagination supported by an industry that bleeds Black folks for inspiration but doesn't care for their very humanity either.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
Praise, Rip Taylor! Camp is alive and well.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
Bad Hair gets far too lost for the majority of its runtime due to a large cast, lack of focus, and feeling tonally challenged.
 "
Bad Hair,62,39,critic,"
While it's quite gruesome, it may not be for everyone, but there are plenty of comedic and dramatic elements to counterbalance that horror.

It could've easily lost its tonal axis, but the different identities mesh with enough thought and craft to properly co-exist.

The Doorman,26,25,audience,"The Doorman is a decent & solid action film, with heart. Ruby Rose plays a good action hero well, along with the action scenes. Jean Reno is excellent as the main villain, and its also made really well by Godzilla: Final Wars & No One Lives director Ryuhei Kitamura. 3½/5."
The Doorman,26,25,audience,Not your ordinary Doorman! Kick ass action!
The Doorman,26,25,audience,I honestly do not know what to say. There has to be underlying reason we do not know about that allowed this Movie to be made. Rose is terrible. Honestly how does she keep getting work? it not because of acting talent. The movie is Die Hard remake. Looks like a 12 year old boy beating up and taking out a trained mercenaries. I dont know what else to say.
The Doorman,26,25,audience,"I liked this movie!  There was lots of action and it moved quickly.  Yes, it is a familiar story, but it kept me entertained.  It's got a good group of international actors.  Basically, it's a fun way to spend the evening, people shouldn't take everything so seriously."
The Doorman,26,25,audience,I couldn't even make it through half the video because the writing is so terrible. The girl child's acting is terrible and the kid max is such a cliche about an angst gamer boy teen who is the most useless character outside of knowing the hotel. The main veteran girl is a typical ptsd story and is one of the most highly trained soldiers but doesn't shoot her gun ever and when she does it's almost like she's aiming for the walls. The story feels so forced and overall better to save your money than watch this shit show.
The Doorman,26,25,audience,"An easy film for critics to unleash their frustrations on.  I think here again negative pro reviews reveal how Cancel Culture is infiltrating even film criticism.  ""Burn it down!"" critiques and a boot in the face doe not encourage creators to make better movies.
Let's start afresh.  What was the likely pitch of this movie when it was green-lit?  Evidence strongly suggests the pitch was re-make Luc Besson's Transporter with a a female lead.  The title, look and feel of The Doorman is Transporter 1 start to finish, even more than Die Hard. The pitch was to make a Luc Besson film without Luc.  
The good news?  The film is watchable as Transporter-lite, enuf resonance and originality to make it to the end.
The bad news?  The writers-director failed to learn the lessons of Atomic Blonde (2017) and the excellent AVA (2020) with Jessica Chastain which is approximately Atomic Blonde 1.5.

What did these films teach creators paying attention? Their big lesson is you can't simply replace Jason Stratham with a female and make a gender-updated Transporter.  You need motivations which arise out of the feminine, not from masculine tropes. As written The Doorman is a script for a MALE LEAD.  
This is why Jean Reno upstages Ruby and takes over the film.  The script hungers for MALE agency.  Female agency is absent in the script.
If you like Luc Besson action films, you will find The Doorman watchable."
The Doorman,26,25,audience,"Oooffa, this was bad.   Complete knockoff on Die Hard w/a woman as the hero (anyone else sick of this fad yet?).  The action, the dialogue & the limp humor all suck.  Save yourself the waste of an hour & a half, skip this tripe."
The Doorman,26,25,audience,"Wow!  
Aaaaand the worst actor of the year award goes to...well, ok, it's shared by four members of the cast but there are certainly a number of other contenders I could point out. Here are the worst in ascending order of abysmal: Ruby Rose herself, Phillip Whitchurch (‘Uncle Pat'), Delianne Forget (‘Mrs. Hersch'), and finally (and most horrifically) Kila Lord Cassidy (‘Lilly Stanton'). 

Aside from Ms. Rose, I must assume these people are related to one of the film's producers. Young Cassidy has an excuse for her performance (I hope), and she still has some time to improve (maybe), but the other two need to find work behind the lens (far behind) as their acting was not even at high-school play level of competence. So poor were the performances that they rendered the film nearly unwatchable, this despite the fact that I shelled out six clams for the, uh, privilege. 
Even the usually very good Jean Reno phoned this one in, probably due to his recognition of the distinct lack of surrounding talent. 

Most of the troubles can be traced directly to the director, as usual. The action sequences were less than convincing at best, downright laughable at worst, and I felt absolutely no sympathy for any of the characters. The plot is so old that I could almost smell the formaldehyde, and little was done to inject any life into the corpse. 

Give this one a pass, folks, it is definitely not worth your time."
The Doorman,26,25,audience,Die Hard wannabe with nothing going for it.
The Doorman,26,25,audience,"Terrible script, fights, acting. Terrible knock off of Die hard. Tried to watch this because Reno was in it. And he has had some good films. But he wasn't good in this and Rose doesn't seem to be able to act to save her life. I've yet to like her in anything, and I'm all for bad arse hot women. Shut it off about half way through."
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
...will certainly do the business for a late-night, undemanding, satisfying watch...
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
Badass female protagonist vs. gang of male hostage-takers, a family in peril, a swanky building with secrets, martial arts fight scenes, and very slight character development. Ryûhei Kitamura follows familiar models but can do significantly better.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
This action story has been tried and tested before, but the fact that The Doorman brings nothing fresh to that recipe is its biggest downfall.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
The Doorman desperately wants to recapture the spirit of Die Hard but demonstrates a complete lack of understanding in what made that film ... work.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
The Doorman may be dumb fun but it might answer the call for exactly what you need.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
You have seen this movie before in the same way that you have seen every Gerard Butler, Bruce Willis, [insert an infinite list of male action stars here] action flick. If you're fine with those, you should have enough fun with The Doorman.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
The Doorman is proverbial boilerplate that's about as engaging as a LinkedIn post.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
There's little humour or invention to leaven the deadened inertness of the script.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
The Doorman is an obvious imitation of better films but it's honest and it's clearly made by and for people who appreciate a good action flick.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
Solid action movie has violence, teen marijuana use.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
From the ground floor up, The Doorman feels flimsy and cheap, and one can't imagine the lone action heroine subgenre dying much harder.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
The characters are not only uninterestingly written but also blandly performed and the action, the one thing a film like this needs to get right, is limply executed.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
Adequately passing the time but rarely engaging, The Doorman greets audiences with an oppressive sense of familiarity.
 "

The characters you expect to get killed are the ones who get killed. The characters you expect to survive are the ones who survive. There are video games that are better than this cliché-ridden, soulless movie.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
The Doorman is hardly the first ill-conceived variant of Die Hard. However, this latest iteration might well be the laziest.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
The Doorman is so deeply committed to not subverting audience expectations that it's almost impressive.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
It's watchable, yes, but if you really want to go in on this kind of thing, you're much better off diving into the Die Hard rip-offs of the '90s that are available.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
The Doorman provides perhaps just enough fun (with Kitamura's style) and flair (with Rose's edgy female spin) to become a mild recommend.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
Yippee-ki-nay.
 "
The Doorman,26,25,critic,"
Far-fetched and uninspired, this action-thriller squanders its setting inside the claustrophobic confines of a New York high-rise apartment building.

Mary and Martha,56,64,audience,"I would say the generational issue can connect to lots of people. For me, it encourages the ideology of empathy, and also encourage people to be aware of things that look little. I would say it is worth to watch but I would not watch again shortly."
Mary and Martha,56,64,audience,Sad story but engaging--I enjoyed it.
Mary and Martha,56,64,audience,Wonderful movie!! A tear jerker....fantastic synopsis.
Mary and Martha,56,64,audience,Had no idea that malaria still claims so many lives.  Shameful that this isn't in the headlines. Good story - slow - but absorbing.
Mary and Martha,56,64,audience,"For this film, one needs to look at the overall effect rather than just story and dialogue. You don't even need to watch the first half of the film, for Mary's character and her obsession with her son is so cliché. For the first half of the film, Mary (Hillary Swank) comes off more like an automaton super-mom than a flesh and blood human. The intent here is that we've got a person who's so obsessed with getting it right because of the parental neglect growing up (yes, she even blames her father for her son's death. That bad!) that she goes overboard in rearing her son and interacting with him. She tries too hard, and ends up coming across forced and opaque. So maybe the nature of Mary's character really is just spot on, albeit plastic and stoic.

What this film really points up is the fact that many in the western world live their lives like royalty while the other 80-90% suffers and suffers dearly. The point here, especially for Americans, is that we may best want to look at what's happening to the rest of the world before we indulge in our little worlds too freely, too often (the U.S. is 6% of the world's population yet has more than half the world's wealth). Do we with all that we have, have a responsibility to reach out and help others? To reach out across continents even? 

This appears to be the message of the film. Let's get out of our tiny worlds, our safe worlds, and look at what is going on elsewhere, or we may just pay dearly for our negligence. It is in the final scene where this point is made obvious. As Mary and Martha appear before Congress, the focus for the decision makers is mere numbers not individual lives, Martha, who guaranteed that she would not speak at the hearing, can't keep quite at one point. Her purpose as a mom, a mom of millions comes to fruition as she begins to show seemingly endless photos of children who have died from malaria. My only qualm with the film is that it didn't give more details in the epilogue about the particulars of the horrors of all the children who have died."
Mary and Martha,56,64,audience,This movie was very moving and left a lasting impression. I am still thinking about it days later. Highly recommend!
Mary and Martha,56,64,audience,"Great movie, though I don't know if I've ever cried so much in a movie!"
Mary and Martha,56,64,audience,So very good! Reality hits home!  It could have been my daughter as she had malaria 5 times and could have easily died.  The message is clear more needs to be done to eradicate malaria.  No one should ever have to die from a mosquito bite.
Mary and Martha,56,64,audience,"Outstanding cinematography and strong performances by Hilary Swank, Brenda Blethyn and even Frank Grillo. This film shows all the emotions and complications felt when losing a child. It also shows the deep problem that Africa has when it comes to malaria. Hilary Swank's characters displays what the beginning of a movement and what activists have to go through to be heard. A great film that's only flaw is it's short running time. If it had longer running time the film could have had more character development between the mothers and sons."
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
Written by Richard Curtis and directed by Phillip Noyce, it's sentimental at times but still unmissable viewing.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
Mary and Martha is a work of fiction, and it's notably light on comic relief. But the real game-changer is that Curtis here tugged on the heart strings by putting his First World characters in the line of fire.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
Its story of loss, love, guilt, awakening and redemption -- while artfully shot, tightly written and well-acted -- ultimately served as a vehicle for a handful of familiar and uncomfortable facts about a disease.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
Mary is headstrong and abrasive, Martha matronly and warm, and the actresses' chemistry makes up for an earnest predictability in the storytelling.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
The remainder of the film is captivating, perhaps in part because it taps into humans' innate voyeurism, perhaps because Curtis props open our eyelids to the cause despite the film's missteps.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
It has an important statement to make, but any semblance of a story keeps getting interrupted by the filmmakers' need to remind you that malaria in Africa is really, really bad.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
While Curtis makes a point of making characters show their grief by gingerly stepping on each other's toes, Mary And Martha is more of a product of unwitting creative insensitivity than an apt reflection of it.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
I'm not ashamed to admit that, in the end, this earnest, oversimplified, well-acted piece -- shot beneath a dazzling African sun -- succeeded in bringing a tear to my eye. It also left me gasping for some genuine comic relief.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
The film grows in power, with both Swank and Blethyn engaging a viewer's sympathies through the force of their performances apart and eventually together after a chance meeting.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
[A] sentimental, misjudged, one-note clunker, that's yet another wide misstep by two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
It's a good message, an important message, one worth repeating as Curtis does each year with Comic Relief and as he does here. It's just too bad the movie isn't better.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
Mary and Martha -- a moving return to intimate form for HBO -- represents an emotionally stirring triumph.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
The malaria story, it seems to say, is filmable only if the central figures are white and it is larded up with the kind of button-pushing that television dramas thrive on. The Africans in this film are largely props for Ms. Swank to hold.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
Mary and Martha is a little film with a big heart. While well acted and artfully shot, it suffers from message movie traps, which isn't to say I wasn't swept up in its good intentions.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
While Swank and Blethyn make everything they're in more remarkable for their presence, the movie plays more like a based-on-fact Lifetime flick than an HBO work of fiction.
 "
Mary and Martha,56,64,critic,"
Mary and Martha is fictional, but the characters have the blandness you generally find in docudramas.

12 Hour Shift,78,42,audience,"5/5.  12 Hour Shift is a hilarious movie with awesome writing, excellent acting, wonderful characters, and the perfect amount of dark comedy.  One of the best movies of 2020."
12 Hour Shift,78,42,audience,"An old-school 'B' Movie that never particularly clicks, but it does have a few moments which mostly come from David Arquette.

The excellent Bettis plays Mandy who goes full Nurse Jackie as she snorts pills and sells organs to a dimwitted cousin which of course doesn't go well.

Fairly entertaining dark comedy horror that did what I needed it to do -- cleanse the mind."

A little too uneven to be a laugh-out-loud riot or a raw-emotioned tale of slapstick survival, 12 Hour Shift is a 20 cc shot of absurdity, but one that didn't quite hit the main vein.
 "

Brea Grant's 12 Hour Shift is an original, creative jaunt down the dark, bloody road of organ harvesting, drug addiction, and self-serving decisions.

12 Hour Shift is a bananas B-horror that makes me envy anyone who can see it after midnight with a crowd.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
Bloody and deadpan farce about a single night in an Arkansas hospital, featuring murder, drugs, a fake nurse, and a refreshing musical interlude.

Strikes an exemplary tone, keeping the callous opportunism at work in its characters' lives in balance with heaps of droll dark comedy.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
Though it won't be everyone's cup of tea, it certainly succeeds in doing something different.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
Brea Grant's 12 Hour Shift is what happens when a comedy of errors, a game of cat and mouse, and some exquisite weirdness make a film baby. It's a dark comedy swaddled in a neo-noir blanket that doesn't feel at all like a sophomore feature.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
The more outlandish it gets the better - when punches fly, gore spurts and vending machines topple, it's bloody good fun.

12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
Goofy humour and cheap production values turn this Dixie horror into frothy, throwaway farce.

It's a throwaway film that perhaps I shouldn't have enjoyed as much as I did, but Mandy is such a deliciously sour character.

A chain of events in a 'comedy of errors' style, with one violent, ill-thought-out and potentially exposing act following hard upon the last.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
Overall, 12 Hour Shift is a wonderfully gross and grimy little crime film, made and led by brilliant women, that offers no judgement and a gruesomely good time at the (home) movies.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
Awash in bloody organs and scheming characters, writer-director Brea Grant's grisly dark comedy 12 Hour Shift ends up being more frenetic than inspired.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
Suffers a little from an oddly-paced plot that feels too low-energy for the type of organ-dealing madness that actually occurs in the film's plot. But when it does pick up the pace and dial up the stakes, it's offbeat, zany and a lot of fun.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
It takes a certain kind of psychopath to keep everyone else in check and 12 Hour Shift gleefully and unapologetically lets her run wild.

12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
""12 Hour Shift"" is torture porn with only money shots and zero foreplay.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
The presence of Angela Bettis adds instant credibility to a horror movie...that is also the case with 12 Hour Shift, a horror thriller that has grace notes of gallows humor.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
It's a spiritedly entertaining bit of unrelenting nastiness, all of it centered on a strong performance from the versatile Bettis that's outstanding.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
A fast-paced, funny, and intermittently very twisted horror comedy.
 "
12 Hour Shift,78,42,critic,"
Grant's script only hints at a sordid past that's never as fleshed out as it needed to be for ""12 Hour Shift"" to earn the emotional undertow of its ending, but Bettis' clenched face helps fill in the rest.

Shortcut,58,24,audience,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Brits that can't act? That's a new one. And the effects are ridiculously bad. The creature has a mouth it can barely open, much less attack and kill people with. Here, I'm gonna gnaw on your fingers for a few, see if I can get a grip. And of course it has the requisite greenish skin and claws that are basically Halloween store fare. And there are four or five against this stupid, shambling thing, and there is detritus all over the place. Why don't they grab some of it and beat the thing to death, ram a pole into its guts? A no-budget, no-acting, no story, nonsensical nothing."
Shortcut,58,24,audience,When did RT stop allowing you to sort by user score?  Was it after Dave Chappelle's special?  I'm guessing.

Shortcut,58,24,audience,There was some suspense and some excitement. The creature wasn't the scariest looking but the noises coming from it were great for Halloween. It was an ok movie.
Shortcut,58,24,audience,"While 'Shortcut' suffers from numerous clichés and pacing issues, it's also a valiant effort to create something fun and spooky out of a very limited budget. The design of the monster is creepy and unique, and the child actors all turn in fine performances. It's rough around the edges, but it's very simple and (mostly) pretty effective."
Shortcut,58,24,audience,"It was funny, that's about it. "
Shortcut,58,24,critic,"
A serviceable creature-feature that will play well enough with housebound under-'20s, the patch-quilt monster-movie/teen drama Shortcut is light on logic but buoyed by an engaging spirit.

If only someone had course-corrected the filmmakers on their own route to making this letdown of a horror road-movie, which gets off to a good start before losing its way.
 "

Shortcut is too violent and foul-mouthed for kids, yet too tame and juvenile for adults, bound to leave horror aficionados indifferent. You'll be better off watching Jeepers Creepers 2 instead, and that's really saying something.

It's a movie that never overstays its welcome - a nice outing for horror fans.

Alessio Liguori's Shortcut is horror about and for teens, allegorising coming of age as a monstrous confrontation in a dark tunnel.

A very good horror thriller that daringly dabbles in to some instances of folklore and fantasy for good measure.

The kindest thing I can say for Shortcut is that the briefly-glimpsed practical monster effects by Rome-based EFX outfit Makinarium (Zoolander 2) are nicely done.
 "

Originality is not the strong suit of this cheesy horror movie.

It's a brief movie ... and even with that succinctness, the filmmakers struggle to find something to do with this material.

This monster tale is by no means good in the traditional sense, but it's scrappy, late-night, popcorn-munching, guilty fun, driven by D.I.Y. teen power, old-fashioned scares, and creepy music.

Teenage Badass,67,100,critic,"
The movie has a certain enduring quality in showing the rise of an up-and-coming band, but then quickly falls into patterns of plot choices that we've seen many times before.

The result is something akin to an amiable three minute pop song whose tune you'll have forgotten three minutes later.

Spiral,76,30,audience,"Some people are calling it the gay version of Get Out.

Although there are some plot holes and a lack of in-depth in the whole cult thing, and some corny and unnecessary melodramatic moments, it manages to deliver an eerie and uncomfortable atmosphere throughout the whole film. Even when it all supposedly happens back in the '90s, it's crazy how relevant the message remains to this day. A few jump scares here and there, some decent acting, and a good twist by the end made the movie even more fun."
Spiral,76,30,audience,"I thought I was getting a different 'Spiral'-- the new one with Chris Rock. This... wasn't that, obviously. But I watched it, and I was severely underwhelmed. The cover claims that it was a cross between 'Get Out' and 'Hereditary', and, while I could clearly see the influence, this film touched the quality of neither of those films. It was just extremely cheap-looking with such a weak payoff at the end."
Spiral,76,30,audience,"It´s ok, it has so much potential and really good actors, but it never really delivers on it. It's like a step away from the final draft of what would have been a great movie. A shame it feels a bit half arsed. The cast is great though."
Spiral,76,30,audience,"After you yawn real wide, an obvious lesson preaching basic humanity is jammed down your throat."
Spiral,76,30,audience,"Chilling, modern horror that hits like a ton of bricks. In a similar vein to Get Out, the supernatural elements serve only to highlight the very real horrors that oppressed groups face every day."
Spiral,76,30,audience,"This movie is brilliant. A gay couple moves to suburbia in 1995 and ends up enduring homophobia and prejudice seemingly but something more dark may be afoot. The movie is packed with symbolism and twists leading up to a mega creepy, inspired finale. Chapman is amazing in the lead. He makes every moment feel genuine. Kurtis David Harder injects the proceedings with an impressive amount of smarts and edge of your seat dread inducing atmosphere. Everything about this film is impressive from the gorgeous cinematography to the haunting score. It's without a doubt the best horror film to feature a gay lead but it's also one of the best films of the year!

Shades of Rosemary's Baby and Rear Window are sprinkled about but the filmmakers also have their own points to make. And scares to deliver.
 "
Spiral,76,30,critic,"
The social and political message about exploiting fear makes the themes in Spiral as timely as they are horrifying.
 "
Spiral,76,30,critic,"
It manages to be both decidedly dark yet with a hope for humanity. I was pleasantly surprised by the film.
 "
Spiral,76,30,critic,"
A queer, chilly spin on a ""town with a secret"" horror-thriller -- that unfortunately feels like a mere tin-eared simulation of a homophobic nightmare.
 "
Spiral,76,30,critic,"
Get Out meets Rosemary's Baby, Spiral demonstrates the horrors of othering in a way that is both modern and classic.
 "
Spiral,76,30,critic,"
Spiral is spooky fun, yet far from sensational or even satisfying.
 "
Spiral,76,30,critic,"
Despite its flaws, Spiral is worth watching and will likely achieve cult status, especially among queer horror fans.
 "
Spiral,76,30,critic,"
The mystery is gripping, playing on the idea of traditional family values as it viciously turns the screws. And what it says about society is urgent.

A gay couple steps into a new home and a paranoid nightmare in Shudder's effectively creepy Spiral.

It wasn't hard to figure out where SPIRAL is leading - but it was still a nice surprise on many levels. A queer leading couple, super creepy atmosphere, and so many turns I wasn't sure what to expect.

Spiral,76,30,critic,"
Viewers will find most the scares familiar, from creaky basements and blood-soaked attics to the standard, cult finale.
 "
Spiral,76,30,critic,"
Neither terribly scary nor particularly surprising, this is a medium-grade horror movie, and the addition of some shallow social commentary isn't enough to make it more than mediocre.
 "
Spiral,76,30,critic,"
The misdirection has mixed results, and can lead to confusion as well as fright, but never boredom.

Children of the Sea,61,61,audience,"Gorgeous sea animation with a daring style, yet convoluted plot.

Ayumu Watanabe's fantasy mystery anime Children of the Sea (2019) is a very pretty movie with this stunning hybrid of lush hand drawn animation and crazy CGI backgrounds here and there. I'm not quite sure how Watanabe and his animators even made Children of the Sea because it looks beautiful, but strange. The vibrant blues for the ocean is truly gorgeous. I love all the sea creature designs and fluid movements. Children of the Sea looks groundbreaking to an extent, but I wanted more underwater animation and sea life. The whales and fish look better than any of the humans. Watanabe's direction is pretty outlandish with creative fantasy visuals and lovely animation. But I kept getting distracted by the incomprehensible narrative.

Furthermore, the general character designs are great, but some of the odd imagery doesn't quite move me like Daisuke Igarashi's writing wants to stun his audience. The story feels underwritten because all the characters come across as weird for the sake of being enigmatic, instead of realistic well rounded people. I couldn't really connect with any of the characters except for the heroine Ruka on a superficial level. Too many characters just spout exposition like water gushing out a whale's blowhole for no reason. Endless narration and exposition isn't as compelling as the neat animation throughout Children of the Sea.

Igarashi's story is strange like it wants to be Akira or 2001, but it's not intelligent or engaging. Children of the Sea is nice to look at, but hardly riveting storytelling. Children of the Sea is a curious mystery, you never quite understand, when it should have tried to lean more into the coming of age elements. I think most viewers will wonder what even happened during Children of the Sea.

Shinji Kimura's art direction is intriguing for all the water glowing and effervescent swimming sequences. All the strange lights against the sea blues look amazing. Ken'ichi Konishi's visual effects are cool for the fish floating around and the translucent glow of certain mystical objects. I think all the lighting looks spectacular. Children of the Sea should have had more Summer vibes and relaxation, instead of dragging on through incoherent rambling fantasy plots.

Joe Hisaishi's score is lovely as usual from the iconic Japanese composer. His serent piano melodies and soaring symphonic compositions are resplendent. Hisaishi's music elevates Children of the Sea to another level. All the voice acting is pretty neat, if a little stilted. I thought the English Dub was alright, although Children of the Sea is probably better in Japanese.

In all, Children of the Sea is not the most incredible anime feature, but it is a pretty one for sure."

Children of the Sea,61,61,audience,"""Kaijû no kodomo"" o en español ""Espíritus del mar"" es una película de animación japonesa de 2019, dirigida por Ayumu Watanabe y basada en el manga creado por Daisuke Igarashi. 
La cinta narra la historia de Luka, una joven adolecente que, en sus vacaciones de verano, encuentra dentro del acuario donde trabaja su padre, a Umy y Sora; dos chicos misteriosos que fueron criados por manatíes en el mar, por lo que desarrollaron maravillosas habilidades nadando y conviviendo con especies del océano. 
Tras el contacto con ellos, Luka se da cuenta que tiene cierta conexión especial con el mar al igual que estos, por lo que poco a poco se adentran en una gran aventura fantástica para descubrir los misterios que ocultan los chicos y una serie de eventos que ocurren en el océano.
Un filme que al principio plantea ser otra historia de una adolecente normal e incomprendida por el mundo, pero que, conforme pasan los minutos se vuelve algo más complejo y onírico. Desarrollando un conflicto que se da entre la timidez inherente de Luka y el enorme alcance del descubrimiento que le espera.
Desde los primeros minutos ""Espíritus del mar"" se destaca por su espectacular animación y por secuencias de ensueño que causan un gran impacto visual. Y, a pesar que el filme cuenta con un estilo de dibujo muy tradicional del anime, en lo relacionado a los personajes con grandes ojos que retratan ternura, es un trabajo detallado en la creación de las anatomías de los cuerpos y resto de objetos, haciendo que estos se vean muy realistas.
Además, la animación también presenta el uso de figuras bastante abstractas similares a los mangas, que logran combinarse bastante bien con los colores, las luces y sombras, con una destreza envidiable por cualquier otra película del género.
Esto, sumado a una banda sonora compuesta por Joe Hisaishi conocido por participar en filmes como El Viaje de Chihiro (2001), El Castillo Vagabundo (2004), Mi Vecino Totoro (1988), entre otros. Una musicalización que se constituye también con gran parte de sonidos del mar como, por ejemplo, los cantos de las ballenas, que logran que la experiencia cinematográfica se vuelva algo fantástico visual y auditivamente.
Sin embargo, a pesar de tener una animación envidiable, la trama falla en diversas ocasiones, generando dudas al espectador, ya que nunca queda todo claro. Esto se da debido a algunas sub tramas, que no aportan nada valioso a la historia principal, que más bien confunden y le restan a la construcción narrativa.
Por lo que si no se presta la atención adecuada a los hechos que suceden en la pantalla, es fácil perder la tensión al momento de llegar a la resolución del conflicto que no se resuelve gracias al desarrollo argumental, sino que es gracias a la ayuda visual que se genera con las animaciones.
Una película que propone un mensaje final sobre cómo los humanos desconocemos de donde vienen las maravillas de la vida y hacia dónde vamos en un mundo del cual no sabemos nada. Por lo que cada personaje dentro de la historia busca o se plantea la manera de explicar la vida desde su punto de vista.
 Por ejemplo, Sora dice ""Yo creo que el universo se parece a los humanos. Dentro de los humanos muchos pequeños recuerdos de historias se están desmoronando, y algunos recuerdos se conectan entre sí. Varios recuerdos se sientes atraídos por un recuerdo más grande, y crecen. Me parece que eso se parece a pensar y sentir ¿no?""
Una historia que es narrada de forma lineal, pero que presenta una particularidad en su final mostrando una escena post créditos con la que se logra cerrar el hilo de argumentos que quedan suelto. 
Y, si bien, los japoneses tienen películas de narraciones de dramas fantásticos, con desarrollos diferentes a las películas occidentales, es importante que estos se plasmen adecuadamente, o sino, corren el riesgo que las ideas no se comprendan de todo bien.
 ""Espíritus del mar"" es una cinta compleja que abarca una premisa difícil de plasmar en argumentos pero que por ello es auxiliada muy bien por sus imágenes y secuencias que hacen que te atraigas por ellas y comiences a pesar sobre el mensaje final que busca retratar."
Children of the Sea,61,61,audience,Its normally not that hard for me to get into most anime movies especially if its visually pleasing. Children of the sea was very beautiful but the story was much to slow and it didn't even end up being worth the wait. I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone.
Children of the Sea,61,61,audience,"The story is indeed far from satisfactory, however, the artful sense definitely worth a watch, like the most brilliant dream I ever had."
Children of the Sea,61,61,audience,"Studio Ghibli was well known for ""feels like a dream"" fantasy anime, but they haven`t done that style in a while. So it felt really good to see a new full length animation-film with that style and this is what Japan do best i think. A real visual fiest for the eye.
But this is not Studio Ghibli story- telling at it`s best though. And some of the ideas is obviously ""borrowed"" from Ponyo. Actually, this is not Ghibli at all. It`s called Studio 4C°. They also released ""Birdboy"" (a spanish animation gem) and the hyper violent mindblowing ""Mutafukaz"". A little taste of their diversity. 

Some of this film feels like a trippy music video and other parts feels like a highschool drama with marine elements...It`s all over the place. But if you want a visual overdose of spectacular beauty and impressive animation techniques, fasten your seatbelt."
Children of the Sea,61,61,audience,I'm a big fan of the children of the sea😀
Children of the Sea,61,61,audience,"This has to be one of the worst anime movies I've ever seen. The story was so messy, confusing and there was barely any plot. The characters felt very distant, I couldn't grab any of them at all. Personally, I wouldn't call the animation beautiful or awesome. It was a bit pretty, but I've seen much much better. Especially the faces of the characters were quite ugly. And the 3D animation didn't look very good. What a complete waste of time.

Even Studio Ghibli's Tales from earthsea is Oscar worthy compared to this."
Children of the Sea,61,61,audience,"Fantastically beautiful, perhaps a genius of animation. But damn, the philosophy of this film is so thick and convoluted that it's an enigma. That may be part of the point of the film itself, to suggest that the universe is infinitely complex and impossible to truly understand. This is why it represents this concept so vividly through imagery and audio, and it does so basically as perfectly as you can. But it leaves the screenplay and story developed in the early portion a bit flat and bland on the back end of the huge climax."
Children of the Sea,61,61,audience,"Esta pelicula en cuanto a su animación esta bien pero de lo demás no funciona, falla narrativamente, el desarrollo de personaje, etc.

Directed with both enchanting whimsy and technical prowess by Ayumu Watanabe ... The movie's environmental message isn't preachy, but it shows how people on land are connected to the life that's underwater.

I don't think it makes much sense, but there is some attractive imagery in it.

""Children of the Sea"" finds plenty of beauty and purpose in the watery depths but doesn't provide enough grounding first: It's all too easy to get lost 20,000 leagues under the sea.

At its best, the movie steadily envelops viewers with curiosity, drive, and an ineffable beauty.

The universe may in fact be held together by dueling perspectives, but the only thing consistent about Children of the Sea is its inconstancy.

Drama is limited here, with the effort soon turned into a purely cinematic experience.
 "

A visual poem that sometimes leans too hard on imagery to convey intent and meaning, Children of the Sea is a simultaneous exploration of individualism and collectivism amid a philosophical exploration of humanity's role in the cosmos.

Get Duked!,87,66,audience,‘Get Duked!' Delivers Bonkers Mayhem and Gory Horror Thrills
Get Duked!,87,66,audience,"Film che naviga al limite tra il bizzarro e il demenziale.
Irriverente e a tratti sinceramente divertente e folle; ogni tanto però l'ironia lascia il passo alla stupidità, non permettendo a Get Duked! di restare sempre sul pezzo."
Get Duked!,87,66,audience,"I don't get it why does it have such a big score? I got a few laughs here and there but the plot is not that original. I mean, in this very year 'the hunt' came out, for instance. They didn't add anything  new to it. And the idea was said out loud by one of the characters. So all that was just to say 'corporations suck, environment, evil old capitalists blah-blah-blah'. I wouldn't say it's fresh."
Get Duked!,87,66,audience,Funny and promising start but lost it's way at the halfway mark.
Get Duked!,87,66,audience,"Another total crap of a film with ludicrous premise and juvenile delinquent acting, couldn't even get thru 20min of it!"
Get Duked!,87,66,audience,"Shoddy watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.

I generally like Eddie Izzard, and this is such a great concept.  The idea of taking the undesired population and culling them through hunting / bloodsport is not new (""Battle Royal"", ""Ready or Not"", ""Would You Rather"", ""Thirty One""), I do feel like this opportunity is squandered a bit.

This is also not the only movie where someone is hunted through the highlands (""A Lonely Place to Die""), but this is the only movie I can think of that basically makes the Scottish Highlands look at the place from ""The Hill Have Eyes"", good old red neck American style.

And there are plenty of idiot characters and movies filled with idiot characters.  One would think that having these morons in such a life threatening situation would make it dramatic or at least give the movie so weight.  Unfortunately, something about the movie makes me feel like I shouldn't take it seriously, so I know they're not in real danger, and knowing that they're going to win with no casualities, just makes them idiots doing stupid things, and there was no point in setting them in the highlands in the first place."
Get Duked!,87,66,audience,"Reefer Madness for Scotland's rabbit droppings epidemic. Finally. Plus a personal discovery that James Cosmo in a jumper riding a tractor is my new kink. A heartfelt thanks to the filmmakers for tackling societal ills and expanding my sexuality. Chapeau!

Joking aside, it's lovely, daft and inventive with a message for societal change at the centre. Delightful."
Get Duked!,87,66,audience,"I enjoyed this movie tremendously. It was perfectly paced with a bunch of twists and turns that I thought would just be interesting tidbits but ended up being really relevant to the plot. The music was great, it was visually stunning. 10/10 would definitely watch again!"
Get Duked!,87,66,audience,"Writer and director Ninian Doff is a talent to watch as the first time feature filmmaker has brought us a fun adventure comedy thriller, 'Get Duked'.   This is empty calories and a good time.  It's not for kids and is quite violent, but even the heavy stuff is goofy.  It's so clear how little the film takes itself seriously, until it does, and then the movie becomes a little preachy. Once we get to the familiar tropes of the man vs the machine it lost me a little, but not enough to not immediately snap me back when a site gag works.  Again, this isn't going to win any awards come Oscar season, but it's enjoyable and easy and we could all use some of that!  Final Score: 7.8/10"
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
A fun little watch, even if the protagonists veer on the side of grating more often than not.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
This is a raucous, non-stop ride that is a little rough around the edges but also unexpectedly endearing, not unlike the four teens at the center.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
One of the freshest and most entertaining entries into the coming-of-age genre in a long while.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
But if you don't care for a message intruding upon your survivalist comedy, Get Duked! makes that easy enough to ignore with its unbridled silliness.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
Sort of a goofball combination of The Most Dangerous Game and Attack the Block, this one's a lot of fun
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
For a comedy horror, there's precious little suspense, but if the story and satire feel undercooked there are explosions of anarchic energy and some eye-catching visual gimmicks.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
[It] easily rates as one of the year's smarter exercises in dumb fun.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
This gloriously idiotic misadventure is the perfect ludicrous comedy romp for the right viewer.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
Doff's efforts on crafting an irreverent and often absurd coming-of-age horror comedy hybrid with Get Duked! show both a great deal of promise and innovative style to boot.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
Doff announces himself as a talent to be reckoned with. His feature debut seems destined for admission into the cult classic hall of fame.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
However sympathetic that Get Duked! might be toward the plight of young people, the movie, under [Ninian] Doff's mostly well-paced direction, doesn't lose its sense of humor as it takes viewers on a madcap ride in the teens' fight for survival.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
It's really an excuse for a lot of drug jokes and very dark humor -- some of it so dark, that it's not really funny, which for me to say is really quite something.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
Ham-handed, dull, and not particularly amusing, Get Duked! is a waste of time and effort.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
Doff honors those traditions of British comedy by making them feel fresh again. Most importantly, he still makes his four teen tossers a squad for whom to cheer.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
It's always welcome when an emerging filmmaker delivers a fully formed film, one with a perspective, a sense of style and most importantly, confidence.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
Drug use, violence, cursing in teen stoner satire-horror.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
The only thing that matters in ""Get Duked!"" is whether you laugh - and Doff is willing to bend the rules of pharmacopeia and physics to make that happen.

The four kids are entertaining enough to accompany them until the end. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
It's fun and the satire has a bit of depth to it, even if the movie never quite carves out its own identity.
 "
Get Duked!,87,66,critic,"
I could have done without the bumbling police officers, intent on a plot involving paedophiles, terrorists and zombies that feels surplus to requirements, but the film is so unpretentiously made that it barrels along on its low-fi, lowbrow charm.

One Night in Bangkok,33,38,audience,Mark Dacasos would be an excellent actor to play in the next hitman movie. This movie proves that. He gives a good performance in this film as well but everything around him not so much. Most of the supporting performances are pretty bad and the movie has way too much talking I was hoping for more hitman action. There’s also a few ridiculous scenes of the right character appearing at the right time. Think of it as a good performance surrounded in a rather mediocre revenge film.
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,audience,Punishingly terrible movie. I had to watch through to the end as some sort of self-imposed penance for deciding to watch it at all.
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,audience,This film is truly terrible. Lead actor washes his hands three times in the first 10 minutes and there's never any paper towel. He reacts. This is the pinnacle of character development. The acting? It seems like everyone remember the lines... The special effects blood and gunshots or without any technical or artistic effort. Why did I use this film as a backdrop to making potato cell salad on a Saturday afternoon? COVID-19. I love the city of Bangkok and I cannot travel. I had hoped the street scene to provide vicarious pleasure. They did not.
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,audience,"Not a bad action movie easy to follow plot, however directors Wych Kaosayananda decision to use split screens was a terrible decision, this type of filming thank goodness died in the 80's."
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,audience,A better start to such a named movie would be for the guy to be rumbling it up in a bar with that song thumping along. 10 minutes in I stopped watching. Way to slow to start any interest.
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,audience,"I saw the reviews of this movie before watching and they all seemed forced which meant I had to watch. This movie has it all, revenge, remorse, redemption, exotic places, justice, introspection, the struggle between good and evil.
I then thought how empty or emotionally ill people must be to pick out the acting flaws instead of seeing the lessons learned from this movie. Some people are destined to live in their prison of lack of perspective to pick out minor flaws that have nothing to do with this movie. They deserve to be the sad little people that they are."
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,audience,"It's not going to stretch your intellectual capabilities, it's not as tense or action-filled as Taken, but it's a pleasant enough journey down a quiet man's path for revenge."
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,audience,"It is a great movie. Not original but it is really good. The pace of the movie was great. The cast acting was on point, the storyline was good. And it is something I can rewatch. The cinematography is good."
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,audience,Wooden acting. Some look like first time actors. As a resident of Bangkok I watched it just because it was filmed here....even then it's a struggle.
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,audience,"Lots of talk, implausible story, predictable, cheaply done, OK if you've run out of films to watch."
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,critic,"
Stream it for Mark Dacascos, who deserves a leading man role, even if it's in this vague, unconvincing noir.
 "
One Night in Bangkok,33,38,critic,"

We're left with all the lowish-octane thrills that follow from watching a man ticking items off his to-do list, and Kaosayananda makes such a deathly plod of it that vast stretches appear to be proceeding in real time.

Dacascos does a terrific job portraying Kai; a peaceful, gentle man who calculates and plans his vigilante justice against those whom he feels have wronged him and his family.

One Night in Bangkok fatally stalls whenever Kaosayananda has to develop his hitman drama beyond place-holding cliches.

Emperor,67,62,audience,Confusing at times. Not as inspiring as I'd hoped.
Emperor,67,62,audience,"While this story is important and captivating, there's too much of a traditional ""historical biopic"" feel filtering the whole thing keeping it from doing anything more than giving a history lesson. This could learn a thing or two from films like 12 Years a Slave and Loving that run on the introspective and visceral journey of the protagonist rather than feeling like every other slavery film from the 90s."
Emperor,67,62,audience,"Dayo Okeniyi, most notable as Thresh in The Hunger Games, gives a profoundly riveting performance as Emperor.  This beginning to end, action packed, fictional reenactment based on the life of a non-fictional unsung hero, Shields Green, grandson of an African King, who played a major role in igniting the  CivilWar, but has been virtually left out of history books; save the writings of Fredrick Douglass, is a must see.  Shields' relentless plight to free his family from an abusive slave owner and move them north is a realistic adventurous portrayal of the grueling plight of slaves.  Masterfully written, Mark Amin and Pat Charles' narrative of the vile inhumaneness of slavery, which gives Shields Green a well-deserved permanent place in history, is apropos to today's civil, unrest among the disenfranchised and the dominant class. 

It also demonstrates the duplicity of the ‘god concept' that remains very prevalent today. Those believing that America is ""god's country…white folks are made in his image and can do whatever they want;"" and the noble abolitionists, including the brave and selfless John Brown, gallantly portrayed by James Cromwell, who believes so strongly in ""THE ALMIGHTY GOD,"" that he made tremendous sacrifice to inspire and teach slaves to fight back and free themselves from bondage.  

This movie helped me overstand the importance of those who fight back with the pen and the necessity for those willing to fight on the battlefields.  Personally, while I prefer to right the wrongs with pen, like the Amity spirit of Qctavia Spencer's character, Johanna in the movie Insurgent, ""I will fight,"" like a Harriet Tubman if necessary. I AM GRATEFUL for a refreshing historical slavery movie like no other that has been made to dated.  It is educational and inspiring as well as very entertaining.  Disappointed that I had never heard of Shields Green, I Googled his name during the movie, as well as the Battle of Harpers Ferry."
Emperor,67,62,audience,"I really love the way this movie portrays the resilience of Black people. He was determined to get his son to freedom. And he did by any means necessary. Anyone of any race can understand the love a father has for his child; especially after the tragedy that was around, Emperor."
Emperor,67,62,audience,"This Civil War action drama was pretty good. Dayo Okeniyi, Bruce Dern, James Cromwell, and the rest of the cast did a good job in this movie. This true story was thrilling, action-packed, and dramatic. It's about fighting for your freedom and doing whatever you can for your family. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. You would probably enjoy it."
Emperor,67,62,audience,"Not at all historically accurate. They took quite a lot of liberties with the beginning and end of the story, making up details of Shields Green's life and completely changing the outcome of his plight. But besides all the historical inaccuracies, if you just wanted to watch it for pure entertainment, the script was a bit weak, which made it hard for the actors to shine. Even though there were some big named actors, their performances were average due to the poor script, character development, direction, and sets. It was enjoyable enough but could have been so much better, IMHO!"
Emperor,67,62,audience,"I truly enjoyed the movie. Especially learning about the true historic events that happened around Harper's ferry. Although it strayed from history in certain aspects to make for better story telling, it did stay true to the main historical elements and characters  and it taught me a lot in a engaging way and it did  feel like a history lesson. Would definitely recommend!👍"
Emperor,67,62,audience,"Great Movie!!!!  The story pulls you in for a scary, thought provoking and inspirational ride. You see what sacrifices people are willing to make for the well being of others, which also makes it a timely film. Don't miss this experience"
Emperor,67,62,audience,"I've seen the rating for this movie on IDBM and it's a 4.6. However, I can tell you that you'll enjoy this movie for its action,  great acting and plot develooment.
 Based on a true story, definitely a must see."
Emperor,67,62,audience,I genuinely enjoyed this film much more than 12 Years a Slave.  More action and an absolutely charismatic lead.  Thanks for bringing to the screen a story and character I knew nothing about and is very very timely.

Green is an active, charismatic figure as played by [Dayo] Okeniyi, and we're firmly on his side.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
Based on the real life story of an escaped slave named Shields Green, it shows the horrors lived and the bravery shown in their fight for freedom of blacks in the United States.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
Despite some very clear liberties being taken with the truth, Emperor is a strong gateway for those less familiar with one of history's lesser known significant leaders.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
This speculative and highly embellished biopic of 19th century freedom fighter Shields Green nevertheless is a timely portrait of courage and resilience.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
'Emperor' is an action-packed film that recognizes the value of Black America's traumatic past and uses that past to embolden us today.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
Fact-based historical drama has courage, violence.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
This version of the story feels rushed at 99 minutes, and by the end it is too apparent that this is a highlights reel rather than the historical epic it might deserve.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
Yet another greatest story never told of all too often buried courageous black history. And though released by chance in this BLM moment, Emperor could not be more timely. Along with bracing Brechtian interludes confronting essential ideological issues.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
As the film progresses, several cast members look like they'd be more comfortable in a Drunk History short; others just look like they'd be more comfortable working for somebody with experience directing actors.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
[Emperor] re-presents a dark period in American history without being inspired or insightful enough to be worth your curiosity or emotional investment.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
Emperor depicts an important piece of American history and gives Shields Green his due years after being forgotten.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
Okeniyi has a strong presence that conveys a genuine moral authority. It stands in stark relief against the movie's consistently cartoonish portrayals of the white slavers.
 "
Emperor,67,62,critic,"
'Black Panther' meets 'The Birth of a Nation' in this rousing account of Shields Green, who escaped the shackles of slavery to fight alongside abolitionist John Brown.

"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
In practice, psychomagic is, per Jodorowsky tradition, more than a bit out-there.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
Jodorowsky's magnetism makes it worth it, but the session could have been shorter. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
Psychomagic, sadly, isn't art; it's advertising.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
I want to believe, but Jodorowsky's method of healing deep-rooted trauma through provocative performance art therapy brings out my inner skeptic.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
It's uncomfortable, and sometimes appalling, but to the artist, it's all part of existence, impurity an inescapable element of life and truth.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
Students of psychology and fans of Jodorowsky will find it endlessly fascinating, if not extremely uncomfortable.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
Set to an ominous score by Jodorowsky's son Adan, the movie drifts into jarring new territory every few minutes.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
There's little to be learned from its two nudity-replete yet tedious hours.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
It's indulgent, absurd, frustrating, and more than a little gross. It's also idiosyncratic and funny enough, and in ways that Jodo's fans will probably love.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
Magic or not, the joy is in the theatricality of it all, which, as always in Jodorowsky's work, is boldly on display.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
For a lot of people, it will be difficult to accept Jodorowsky as any kind of healer.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
Revelatory or risible, it's impossible to look away from it.
 "
"Psychomagic, a Healing Art",77,,critic,"
Whether or not the 91-year-old Alejandro Jodorowsky makes another film, Psychomagic could easily stand as a fitting encapsulation of the themes of suffering and transcendence that have run throughout his work.

Out Stealing Horses,76,62,audience,"I enjoyed the story but overall it was a slow, dull movie."
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,audience,"I didn't read the book.   Instead, I've watched a lot of American movies and a few made by Koreans and Germans.   This is a damn good movie.   Introspective, layered and wonderful to have it wash over you.   Why more movies like this aren't available in the US, I haven't a clue.   Acting superb, settings immense.   Franz I will remember.   Almost want to live in Norway now.   Please show us more of this."
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,audience,"Perhaps because I watched it just after finishing the book, it just wasn't as good. I don't mean the old ""not as good as the book"". It's just... so much of the beauty in the story was in the poetic way it was written. The movie was beautifully made, with wonderful cinematography, sound editing, soundtrack, acting... but the story just isn't as touching when told on cameras. Anyway, I prefer to keep the images I got from the book. But it's a good movie."
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
The film attempts to delve into an interesting relationship between a father and son...but unfortunately, the more interesting parts of the plot aren't fully developed.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
It's an honest film about a likeable guy, but is too subdued to get you excited.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
Just an ordinary movie from Norway starring the extraordinary Stellan Skarsgard. The movie never reaches the level of his talent.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
Skarsgård delivers a reliably compelling performance in the film's most poignant moments.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
Out Stealing Horses is a solid movie that does a very good visual interpretation of the novel. Although the character of Trond is a specific person, the movie's themes about family dynamics and childhood memories can resonate with many people.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
Moland's obvious model here seems to be Terrence Malick, and even if you find the movie underwhelming and confusing, you might appreciate its discrete moments of beauty, especially in the flashbacks.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
Composer Kaspar Kaae's vibrant and unexpected score and cinematographer Rasmus Vidbaek's magnificent widescreen views of the harshly beautiful Norwegian countryside effectively immerse viewers in both aged grief and angsty adolescence.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
Overflowing with internal and external conflict, Hans Petter Moland's Out Stealing Horses is a gently-paced, exceptionally-written, sensory experience.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
Beneath the bleakness, there's a cathartic beauty in this incisive character study about guilt, regret, and mortality.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
When the title of a film is more vibrant than anything you'll see on the screen, it's an issue.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
The film uses a dizzying array of flashforwards and flashbacks within the flashbacks to reflect his tortured mind, set to an intriguingly timeless score.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
There's some appreciable serenity and a lot of personal grief on display in Out Stealing Horses, but it's only visible in fits and starts.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
Moland and team create the glimmering, lush and gorgeous memories Trond relives-too gorgeous to be exact, but exactly as gorgeous as needed to be memory.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
...Out Stealing Horses is a barbed rejoinder to the optimism of coming of age movies, questioning whether our protagonist ever comes of age at all.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
What Mr. Moland is after, in tackling an ""unfilmable"" novel, is evidenced in the visual tone, emotional content and Mr. Skarsgård's mutely eloquent performance.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
It's melancholy and rather bluntly honest, for sure. It's also befuddling and entirely anti-climactic.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
A melancholy permeates every frame of Moland's film and can be felt with every note of Kaspar Kaae's gorgeous score.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
Moland relies on glacial pacing to underscore the sensuality before having his hero declare what's happening instead of simply showing it.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
An ambitious film that examines memory and consciousness through the perspective of an older man who's determined to escape from memory and to constrict his lived experience.
 "
Out Stealing Horses,76,62,critic,"
OUT STEALING HORSES is a specific ride for those who appreciate the beauty of life, love and forgiveness.

Host,100,73,audience,This movie took the most tired and overused haunting tropes and crusted them with three too many references to covid.
Host,100,73,audience,This movie is very very very very boring and it gets old very easily. The director should focus on something else and not directing movies.
Host,100,73,audience,"I've seen both versions of ""Unfriended"", this movie surpasses both IMMENSELY. I haven't screamed at a horror movie in YEARS, but the ending got me. As someone who messes around with spiritual things, this is a perfect example of why you do  NOT disrespect spirits. If you also mess with that stuff you'll understand the frustration with 'Jemma' and know that, even if slightly exaggerated, this shit could happen. The characters seemed like a group of friends that have been affected by the quarantine and frustrated with each other and the pandemic at certain points. Those weak spots made them an easy target for demonic energy especially when a few don't take it seriously. If you want to cower behind blankets for a good scare I 100% recommend."
Host,100,73,audience,I would rather swallow a bucket of nails and go in an mri machine than be subject to this again.
Host,100,73,audience,"Movies that properly gauge their staying power aren't exactly a dime a dozen. Host perfectly understands what it is. More precisely, it understands what it is not. There is no unnecessary character building, no excess dialogue to flesh out the story - just friends on a video chat getting together for some fun. Obviously that fun goes wrong. It's a fast and wild ride that is a blast to watch."
Host,100,73,audience,"Fantastically entertaining horror that captures the atmosphere of 2020 perfectly through a zoom-based seance. 

Fabulous script, production and direction. Practically faultless"
Host,100,73,audience,That. Was. Awesome. Suspenseful and scary 56 minutes. Loved it. So simple yet creative.
Host,100,73,audience,The fact that this is rated so highly is beyond me.
Host,100,73,audience,"Modern Day Horror at its Best, simple, but gets the job done"
Host,100,73,audience,So good! I enjoyed Host from beginning to end.
Host,100,73,critic,"
The meticulous nature of Savage, writers Gemma Hurley and Jed Shepherd, and the cast makes this one of the best supernatural horror films I've seen to date.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
Rather than doing the obvious thing and making the virus the monster, Host shows us how the social isolation exacerbated by the pandemic can make any traumatic experience all the more horrifying.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
By adapting to current world events and the popular technology that goes with it, Host further proves how crucial found footage is in capturing social fears.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
What Host does is continue the tradition of found footage not just in the world of lockdown but also within an advancing age of interactive technology used day to day.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
Six friends hold a séance via a video conference and inadvertently admit something unknown into their meeting. Genius contemporary horror from Rob Savage and friends.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
An effective shocker for our quarantine times.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
For what it is, it works.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
While it doesn't reinvent horror or even the ""screenlife"" subgenre, Host gets by with a bevy of unsettling, clever, and economical choices...
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
The film is the example of how with few resources, a modest budget, but that is a great idea, you can create a more than remarkable genre film proposal. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
Carving a sharp and scary scenario that just so happens to be held over Zoom and in 2020, Savage and his team nail every aspect of this timely horror.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
Host's freshness lies in the sincere frontality of a modest production. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
This is an impressively well-made thriller, terrifying simply because it feels so authentic.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
Director Rob Savage pumps up the terror using the most minimal of means.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
It's an absolute corker of a picture, too: a lean, smart and efficient animal of a horror picture. At just 56 minutes, there's not an ounce of fat on this beast.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
Until someone makes a film about a haunted sourdough starter, this ingenious horror movie will remain the zeitgeistiest thing to emerge from lockdown.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
Good directors embrace limitations, and Rob Savage has more than proven his worth on this front.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
It's still rubbish - you'll be constantly yelling, ""Just turn on the bloody lights!"" - but a good kind of rubbish.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
Like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity before it, [Host] also transcends its potentially gimmicky premise with genuine scares that reflect a new way of interacting with the world.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
There's a winning amount of levity, but when it goes for the jugular Host maintains its ferocity and frights for an impressive duration.
 "
Host,100,73,critic,"
Host remains resolutely its own thing: a smart, inventive and genuinely scary time capsule steeped in the dread of a global pandemic.
 "
Retaliation,80,,audience,"Orlando give the performance I always thought he could. I really liked how he played his character and the actress who play is girlfriend is so great too. I never had pity for them, it's really more about being strong.

This movie should be translated and played in Québec. The story resonate so much with was is going on in our province.

The only thing I didn't like was how the story was tell. I thought at one point it was a dream but it wasn't and it was weird. It seem like some part of the story was cut. Still, it's a hard subject but it's not hard to watch. I recommend this movie"
Retaliation,80,,audience,"Who knew Orlando Bloom could act?
A tough topic well examined (perhaps over-examined?) from the victim's perspective, the film is a bit draggy, but Bloom's performance is surprisingly good and his character's pain is palpable. 
No action flick, but lots of violence nonetheless."
Retaliation,80,,audience,"The pace was uneven but the story was electrifying, violent & deeply psychological."
Retaliation,80,,audience,"Very powerful!  A lot of sex, so maybe don't watch it with your mother-in-law!"
Retaliation,80,,audience,It's like Midsommar all over again. This movie SUCKS!
Retaliation,80,,audience,Goodness Orlando Bloom knocked this one out of the park
Retaliation,80,,audience,We shut this off after 5 minutes. It got weird and was stupid
Retaliation,80,,audience,"DO NOT pay attention to idiotic/ignorant 1-2* reviews, those who suffer from poor attention spans & minimal life experience. End of rant. Bloom's performance, along with fellow actors, was wonderfully & painfully stellar. How would I know? Lived a similar experience at an earlier age. This film is challenging, complex, emotional and heart-rending. It's also inspirational for those willing to surrender to its painful truths & can serve as a way to understand, more deeply, the suffering of others. This is a well-told story that covers the extent to which someone can be so deeply wounded, not just from the abuser, but also from well-meaning people…"
Retaliation,80,,audience,This is a difficult movie to watch but well worth it for Orlando Bloom's performance as the man who was abused by his parish priest as a child.   You can feel his character's pain throughout the movie and Bloom should be proud of his performance.  The supporting cast is also very good but it is Bloom's show for certain.  Highly recommended  - 8/10.
Retaliation,80,,audience,"Very slow, really no climax to the movie. Just dragged on."
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
One of Orlando Bloom's strongest performances.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
A rather somber, unexpectedly tasteful character study of a conflicted protagonist left all alone to grapple with his significant demons.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Grueling... Orlando Bloom has never turned in a better performance, and I'm sure that's why he elected to do this.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Orlando Bloom's deeply felt performance anchors this character-driven Irish thriller that too often lacks the subtlety and narrative dexterity its tricky subject matter requires.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
The film perseveres through Bloom's brilliant muted performance.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Orlando Bloom's searing performance is the primary reason to watch this slow, heavily symbolic drama about a man coming to terms, after many years, with the trauma he's suffered as a result of being molested as a child.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Retaliation (which was formerly titled Romans) isn't a simple revenge film. It's also a scathing commentary on institutions and people who cover up or deny abuse, thereby allowing the abuse to be inflicted on more people, with no real accountability.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Retaliation is one of 2020's best kept filmic secrets and Bloom's remarkable performance is an absolute knockout - not only his best on-screen performance ever, but one of the year's most outstanding turns.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
...in a brilliant, brooding, captivating performance here, Bloom has established himself as an intense, physical, screen-dominating presence...
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Brutal drama about sex abuse within the church.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
British drama Retaliation does not reinvent the wheel, but it should be commended for its measured pacing and a staggering, career-best performance by Orlando Bloom.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Retaliation benefits from Bloom's mature, internalized performance [and] commanding physical and emotional presence... He deftly conveys the shame and confusion Malky feels; it is as heavy as the cross he carries from the church he is demolishing.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Retaliation may be effectively provocative, but only because its creators put more effort into upsetting viewers than converting us.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Bloom delivers a shattering performance in a powerful drama.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Whether you're skeptical of Bloom's abilities or have long been a believer, you can't help but respect what the actor does with ""Retaliation.""
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
It all leads up to a final confrontation and epilogue that somehow ... seems to do everything wrong.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
Mostly, ""Retaliation"" accords Bloom a chance to deliver some impressive, anguished monologues...
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
War isn't welcome here, with screenwriter Geoff Thompson supplying a theatrical-style inspection of profoundly painful psychological erosion.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
An intense character drama that has a few pacing issues but ultimately hits the viewer right in the gut.
 "
Retaliation,80,,critic,"
There's substance in (Bloom's) performance that lifts ""Retaliation"" above its hammered-home metaphors.

Game of Death,57,26,audience,Idk about the acting in this one ..... man was that your piss ? Aw ya got me . Very hectic and chaotic . I think the main thing that kept me from liking was the fact none of the characters were likeable . Maybe I’m getting too old 2.2. It was extremely messed up though and I’m sick in that kinda way.

Seven friends play a mysterious game, and with a name like ""Game of Death"", what do they expect? I didn't expect much, but it was bright, fun, creative, and splattered with blood.

Game of Death,57,26,critic,"
The overall unlikability of the cast made a majority of the narrative frustrating and unenjoyable, with its frenetic editing compounding the irritating experience.
 "
Game of Death,57,26,critic,"
When your film only lasts 75 minutes, there's little time to waste on character development, so it's good that since directors Sebastien Landry and Laurence Morais-Lagace have filled their film with a despicable, generally one-dimensional group.
 "
Game of Death,57,26,critic,"
Game of Death is a fun concept for a horror film that leaves a lot to be desired.
 "
Game of Death,57,26,critic,"
Game of Death ... is essentially a repetitive, mindless bloodbath. The only heads that might explode for Game of Death are when viewers get bored or frustrated with this bottom-of-the-barrel horror flick.

At least the game's countdown feature told me when the movie would be over.

Game of Death,57,26,critic,"
Game of Death doesn't care about your socially charged sub-plots; it only wants mayhem, and that's exactly what it delivers.

Sebastien Landry and Laurence ""Baz"" Morais accomplish their end goal - blow up heads, and question life's meaning.

 "
Game of Death,57,26,critic,"
Game of Death is quiet, edgy, dark and violent. It's got a faux-retro vibe in only the way that 2000's babies will appreciate. It's the Spring Breakers of Horror.
 "
Game of Death,57,26,critic,"
Fountains of blood and questionable millennials populate Laurence Morais and Sebastien Landry's campy Game of Death, a slick and uproarious horror comedy where its kill or be killed in a heady celebration of schlocky violence and over-the-top gore.

Volition,88,74,audience,"Laughable script, super silly story, total trash"
Volition,88,74,audience,Good twist but after the twist everything the guy did was so stupid. The solution was so simple it was irritating. 
Volition,88,74,audience,"Guy finds himself caught in a time travel loop made by his own choices - what's not to like?  Volition was well-paced, engaging throughout, and more than the sum of its parts.  Recommended to anyone who would like a well-constructed timetravel movie."
Volition,88,74,audience,Fun little time travel film which despite some fuzzy logic in places works really well.
Volition,88,74,audience,"Low budget, but not bad"
Volition,88,74,audience,Painfully awful. Watched based on the score that was posted at the time (85%) but now I'm actually upset that the score was anywhere near that high. I wrote a more detailed review with my honest thoughts but erased it because I couldn't make it not sound mean. I'll just say the score for this movie score obviously inflated disingenuously.
Volition,88,74,audience,I suggest going into this one knowing as little as possible about the plot. The first 15 minutes are a bit shaky and you'll be wondering how bad this movie might get but once things get going you'll realize that everything that happens has a purpose. Great twists throughout!
Volition,88,74,audience,'Volition' is an endlessly twisty mind-bending sci-fi thriller that deserves attention for being clever and inventive.
Volition,88,74,audience,still trying to figure out ending but good fun movie overall.  my sister didn't like it as much as i did but i like movies that make me think
Volition,88,74,audience,A tad over dramatic with the acting from the all seeing guy but overall I liked the movie and it was a semi new take on this particular genre . Tbh the acting all around was kinda below average but the story carried it along 2.8. Everybody treated his ability way to calmly and as if it was a normal everyday thing . The dad pulling out the picture so quickly like he was expecting a visit and just never mentioning it to his son who he supposedly completely believes was just odd to me . that picture book really bothered me and I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the film . The second half of the film which after seeing you’ll know what I mean definitely redeemed itself and brought me back in but I don’t believe the original theory that he couldn’t control anything he sees . He coulda def locked himself in a room and avoided it. Guy was incredibly done with his powers 
Volition,88,74,critic,"
A sci-fi film noir about the implications of knowing the future, and the motivation to change it. Tense, sharply written, and a very satisfying watch.

Smarter than it needs to be, which is also what makes it so fascinating to watch and try to puzzle out.
 "
Volition,88,74,critic,"
The performances save it. The pathos of the picture pays off. And the puzzle that the Smiths create doesn't slow down the panicky pace enough to stop it in its tracks.
 "
Volition,88,74,critic,"
As the title suggests, where there's a will there's a way, and Volition delivers on much of its initial premise. Enjoy the madness.
 "
Volition,88,74,critic,"
This crime story elevates into a science-fiction mind-bender.
 "
Volition,88,74,critic,"
The film basically requires one giant leap of faith to work at all. Fortunately, the Smith brothers' script is succinctly propulsive enough to make that easy.

We Are Little Zombies,93,69,audience,"A unique film, 'We are Little Zombies' is a visual experience you'll have to see and perhaps see again.  I found myself missing dialogue as I was so entranced by the visuals which had a distinct old school video game feel.  The soundtrack to this film constantly made me smile, but also served as a distraction.  It's a Japanese film and with it comes subtitles.  This could be a tough watch if you're not into a lot of things going on.  It's a spectacularly busy flick, but it's never uninteresting.  Final Score: 7/10"
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,audience,"The initial 35% or so is quite unusual and enjoyable.  Then the 'enjoyable' begins to rapidly evaporate.  Leaving only the 'unusual' behind.
2.24/5"
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,audience,"Four kids meet and become connected when their parents are being cremated. The film starts out with the stories of what happened to their parents. Unable to deal with the grief associated with their loss, the kids form a band, Little Zombies. This is a film that is hard to describe adequately. It is a coming of age story. It is a film about young kids trying to deal with their feelings in the face of significant loss. It is also one of those movies about kids who form a band, create tunes that you cannot shake from your head, and become famous. There are some wonderful things about the film. The filming and camerawork are very inventive – the photographer captures the kids in motion from different and unusual angles. The shifting camerawork keeps the film moving forward and fun. One of the kids serves as the narrator, and he ensures you are never very far from the core of the friends' feelings. The screenplay is very well done; on the surface, it is one of those kid's programs that preteens watch on TV. But the stories of the kids and how they deal with their emotions (or lack of) feel very real and have substantial depth. And, of course, that song that just sticks in your brain. Big thumbs up for me for a film that is inventive, thoughtful, and insightful and told completely through the eyes of the kids experiencing loss. I loved it."
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,audience,"Explosively weird, but also enjoyably so, We Are Little Zombies is a colorful smorgasbord of creative filmmaking, as well as an exploration of dark emotional themes that speaks not only to the relatable kids out there, but to anyone trying to listen to their adolescent children."
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
An extremely impressive first feature film from Makoto Nagahisa, a musical comic drama about navigating life out of grief, both deep and uplifting.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
The addled direction pours on gimmicky camerawork and editing, plus onscreen graphics, animation, videogame fillips, movie homages, et al. I found it exhausting and annoying.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
We Are Little Zombies drags a little too long ... but there's enough originality and compelling visuals in the movie for people to be interested in finding out what happens to these emotionally jaded kids who aren't as tough as they might think they are.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
Though it's often dazzling in its creativity, the sheer magnitude of its visual inventiveness can start to weigh you down after two hours.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
Doesn't waste a single moment, taking us on unexpected twists and turns through fun-house like visuals and warp-speed dialogue.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
Nagahisa's visual and intellectual experiment is one of the most original narratives to date about about the importance of love and the need for grief to come into being.

Little Zombies still manages to stay coherent even while spiraling through incongruent moods. That's what makes the movie so special...
 "

An enjoyable coming-of-age music/drama.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
Written and directed by Makoto Nagahisa, We Are Little Zombies is a breakout feature-length debut from someone with a clear vision, unshackled by convention or hemmed in by traditional style.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
We Are Little Zombies is an explosive pop-rock shriek into the void; bursting with creativity and confronting the darkest truths about life, death, and growing up in over-saturated hues.
 "

Colourful and wildly paced, this Japanese romp assumes a child's eye view as it tackles darkly serious themes with comedy and music.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
It's a visual kaleidoscope anchored by a killer soundtrack. It's simply FUN.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
Nagahisa's eclectic debut doesn't talk down to these kids at all; it lets them approach grief the way they want to-whether it's through starting a band or stealing a garbage truck.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
Nagahisa throws everything in his cinematic arsenal at the proverbial wall - and gets most of it to stick.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
We Are Little Zombies' exploration of the mechanics of mourning, particularly the uneasy disjunct between inner and outer emotions, is layered and sincere.

Whatever demented game its characters are playing, Nagahisa's live-action Twitch-fest is delightful for how it lets us watch along.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
Nagahisa's script dares to embrace true nihilism: not selfishness, not posturing decadence, but the genuine commitment to your core that the meaningless of the world isn't a bug, it's a feature.
 "
We Are Little Zombies,93,69,critic,"
[WE ARE LITTLE ZOMBIES is] a full-throated barbaric yawp of an impressive and new major talent arriving on the cinematic scene...[delivering] a joyful movie about being isolated, forgotten, and even feeling devoid of happiness...

Followed,73,46,audience,Just a cleaner looking cliche found-footage horror film. 5.2/10
Followed,73,46,audience,"i actually don't think it's THAT bad... it's just SO cheesy. both the dialog & the acting. i wouldn't recommend, but if you like mediocre B-movies you might enjoy it."
Followed,73,46,audience,"Starts out seeming a bit cheesy and corny, but finishes so strong. Maybe some would say the plot twist was expected, but I didn't see it coming. I'm an avid horror movie watcher and fan. Horror isn't the same as it used to be. This was a refreshing piece of hope for found footage type of horror film. I also greatly appreciate seeing new faces in the cast. I personally say it's worth the watch. There's so much to unpack tied into real events and mysteries. It's so hard to find a good horror movie in the recent years, this was definitely one of the better ones."
Followed,73,46,audience,"The lead is possibly the worst actor I've seen in a long time, made worse by the fact that the character is instantly dislikable (I want him to suffer from the word go). The supporting cast are poor, plot is thin, movie is full of cliches and there is absolutely nothing original about it at all... oh and it's not scary so it completely defeats the object 0.1/10"
Followed,73,46,audience,"Great premise and a creepy set up, but mediocre acting and rudderless direction took away from the scares. If you like this genre it's overall worth a watch."
Followed,73,46,audience,"Okay as far as the low bar set by found footage movies goes, but nothing particularly special. The ending is rubbish too."
Followed,73,46,audience,"Followed is a terrifying, thought provoking journey through a real-life inspired hotel from hell and influencer culture!"
Followed,73,46,audience,"Crap! Rubbish! Garbage! Horse manure! I could go on... This was beyond ridiculous! I normally like found footage horror, but this was a TOTAL let down. The protagonist is one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever seen in film. Very little to like about him. The film itself is like watching a really long YouTube video about an idiot putting his friends life in danger, and that ambiguous ending puts the cherry on the cake of this already pathetic film. I'd give zero stars if I could. This movie was a TOTAL yawn-feast, but if you're in the mood to lose an hour and half of ur time, then by all means; watch this piece of drivel."
Followed,73,46,audience,"Honestly signed up for a rotten tomatoes account just to rate this movie positively. I'm a big fan of found footage movies and have seen the worst of the worst and the best of the best, and even if I didn't know this was an indie film I'd still rate it high. Way better than As above, So below, and with a crowd sourced budget. Mike as the obnoxious influencer until he actually gets a reason to stay in the plot (a plot point sorely missing in many films, not just indie horror) Chris with the reason to be apprehensive, Dany as the voice of reason getting it reasonably flipped on to her, and nick with the trauma providing a reason the ""found footage"" was impeccably edited is a testament to the writers and actors. Only criticism is I felt a little dirty with some of the horror capitalizing on the tragedy of Elisa lamb. It was a big creepy news story though so I guess it was going to happen, just a couple of self reflective points where I thought ""oof, im enjoying this a lot because I was so morbidly interested in that in the first place."" So maybe blame audiences more than horror movie makers, i suppose we go to slasher flicks because slashers exist. Anyway, TL;DR: indie found footage movie kills it way more than most studio films, just pay the rental fee dummy"
Followed,73,46,audience,Right about in the middle of the FF movies.Some jump scares but for the most part nothing new here.
Followed,73,46,critic,"
An uneven blend of social media, found footage, and peer pressure, but somehow there are some effective chills amongst the shallow plot.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
You might be thinking, ""If I never have to see another found-footage, shaky-camera horror flick, I'd be content for the rest of my days."" But if you have to watch one more, you could do worse than Followed.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
Followed, with its contrived shaky ghosts and shoddy script, is this generations answer to The Shining and 1408, without the compelling stories.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
An unlikeable protagonist and messy story take away from a film that otherwise has compelling things to say about true crime entertainment and social media influencers.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
Nothing revolutionary here, but does deliver some clever, scary moments along the way.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
Thanks to a unique blend of the Screenlife and found footage formats, Followed offers a nice critique of the dangers of social media.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
""Followed"" is a fun and scary romp through the mysterious Lennox Hotel through the eyes of a social media influencer. A fun film filled with jumpscares and eerie moments.""
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
The claustrophobia of our pandemic digital existence adds to the later scenes... moreover, the reveal for why Mike is so determined to do something so dumb as wake the dead adds a surprising poignancy to the well-executed chills.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
FOLLOWED isn't groundbreaking, but it's a darn good attempt at breathing new life into the found footage sub-genre.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
Followed turns its camera on social media horrors as filmmakers have since the techno-horror boom around Unfriended's success (or earlier with The Den, etc.), without furthering subgenre conversations.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
It's shot and assembled well, and there's still, even after so many other movies like this, a built-in tension to the first-person immediacy of the presentation.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
Followed remarkably combines social media and found footage to tell a spine-chilling story that will make you want to leave the lights on.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
A worthy watch for any horror fan, whether they're into found footage or not. Le and crew have made a sleek, sometimes mean and sometimes funny entry into the genre, expertly crafting some of the creepiest moments of found footage in recent memory.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
It's seldom that a found-footage horror movie pulls some new tricks in that overtaxed subgenre, and ""Followed"" runs no risk of being any such exception to the tedious rule.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
While Followed won't lead you to any conclusions that you can't get reach by yourself, it's sometimes fun getting there anyway.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
It has atmosphere, conviction, some jolts, and a narrative that holds up to scrutiny, which shouldn't be too much to ask, but is more than we often get.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
Yet another tired example of the ""found footage"" horror subgenre, this haunted hotel story mainly consists of junky, twitchy video footage and annoying characters who make poor decisions.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
When the setup possesses this much promise, the payoff can't be this underwhelming.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
Working as a hybrid of ""Grave Encounters"" meets ""Paranormal Activity,"" the new indie horror flick ""Followed"" manages to conjure legitimate thrills and scares, suggesting director Antoine Le has a bright career ahead of him.
 "
Followed,73,46,critic,"
... like ""Paranormal Activity"" crossed with Ty West's ""Innkeepers"" with writer Todd Klick adding a psychological twist... This one's claim of having been based on true events is also more valid than most.

Scare Package,80,81,audience,I’ve come to the conclusion I’m just not a fan of these multiple movie horror anthrologies 2.1
Scare Package,80,81,audience,‘Scare Package' is a Horror-Comedy Anthology That Gives Us the Goods
Scare Package,80,81,audience,The first 45 minutes were decent.  The last short was ok.  Everything else in between was boring or nonsense.
Scare Package,80,81,audience,"Though somewhat entertaining and gory, it felt long and hard-trying. I get it, you want to poke fun at the genre, what else?"
Scare Package,80,81,audience,"It's not the best horror anthology, but it's still kinda fun. Like most, some of the stories play better than others. They're all really cheesy though, so you gotta be prepared for some B-movie goofiness."
Scare Package,80,81,audience,"This is one for true horror fans. You gotta love: horror anthologies, homages to horror classics, B-movies, horror-comedies, buckets of gore, and for extra credit ... -----MILD SPOILER-------Joe Bob Briggs.  If you pass that check-list and are intrigued, you may enjoy ""Scare Package."" Unfortunately, that formula, even with an iconic horror classic trope/theme to focus on each segment, gets tedious over seven segments.

There is a lot to love, and if you've imbibed a bit, then your enjoyment will likely be greater.

And that Joe Bob Briggs Cameo! (I was given the original Joe Bob's Drive In book as a gift back in 1985). The guy rocks and was my favorite part of the movie.

My quibbles: Having the first short before the wrap-around story intro was innovative but confusing; the over-the-top gore get's repetitive; it's too long.

Drive-in Academy Award for the special effects team who must have been very very busy!"
Scare Package,80,81,audience,It was campy fun! It is a horror movie that will be a cult classic someday. It is worth the watch.  In about 30 minutes you will be glad you are watching it.
Scare Package,80,81,audience,"My expectations were very high for Scare Package as critics have it in 80s for positive reviews. Maybe I’m missing the joke, as I found all the setups to be uninspired, and the filmmaking styles and plot choices very first year film student/ underground fringe festival production. To me it failed even as a dark comedy or horror satire, as the filmmakers seem to be mocking the genre instead of crafting a loving homage to genre as Scream did. "
Scare Package,80,81,audience,Story was written by poorly. Really couldn't even follow where the willingness 'not to follow' or to follow? Honestly would say watch it... if you haven't anything else. Otherwise avoid it.

Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
In a time where horror anthologies are a dime-a-dozen and creativity seems to be in short supply, Scare Package is an incredibly refreshing - and bloody - alternative.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
A collaboration between eight directors who all seem to possess a great deal of affection for the genre but nothing interesting or amusing to say about it.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
When a movie's primary goal is to demonstrate that it's smarter than the genre's run-of-the-mill, comparison with others of its type is unavoidable.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
Scare Package is a remarkably effective, solid anthology movie. The tone is fun and light-hearted... with the emphasis on gooey, crunchy, splattery gore and solid, smart jokes. ...A must-watch, horror fan or otherwise.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
You've gotta love a film that is willing to be silly, and Scare Package embraces its goofy side. Any crude edges and roughness in the film only add to its charm, making it an ideal popcorn feature.'
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
Scare Package is a charming, razor sharp, body melting, blood splashing good time.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
'Scare Package' is a fun (albeit shaky) stirring of gruesome effects, dark humor and genre references.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
The movie wants to recall those special fun bad movies that we all rented back in those days, things like 'Night of the Demons' and 'Monster Dog.' This approach sometimes hurts the movie... but it nonetheless has a certain charm.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
This big dumb kooky ball of blood, goo, and fun is more than merely a package: it's a gift
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
Scare Package is made by and for hardcore-horror fans who love the genre. If seeing VHS grain over spotty gore effects makes you feel giddy, Scare Package is perfect for you.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
A talented ensemble of stars in frequently hilarious and tongue-in-cheek tales subverting horror tropes and a gleeful abundance of gory practical effects.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
Uneven though it may be, Scare Package is campy, gory fun.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
It is perfectly hilarious, genuinely fun, and deserves to be watched right away.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
Originally called Tropes, Scare Package is meant to be a clever send up and deconstruction of all the motifs that genre fans recognize whenever we're watching a horror movie, but ends up accomplishing far more than that in its execution.
 "
Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
Your mileage may vary when it comes to this sort of pandering humor, but that doesn't make Scare Package more clever or less janky.

Scare Package,80,81,critic,"
Scare Package is meant for horror fans, but even the most tolerant among them won't find much to enjoy here.

The Soul Collector,73,77,audience,"It was an okay horror movie, I was expecting a little more on the horror side but it was spooky enough and mysterious to begin with. Also had a good plot unlike many of its genre."
The Soul Collector,73,77,audience,The acting is great . The plot is original . The recipe is a succes !
The Soul Collector,73,77,audience,"Soul Collector is one of the most unique films I’ve seen in a while a very fresh take on demon possession in a seldom if never seen setting and culture, the story line gets a little muddled and the end is a bit of a head scratcher but in a way that leaves you thinking but not pissed off over all a worthwhile watch."
The Soul Collector,73,77,audience,"South Africa is an interesting and relatively unexplored area of the world for horror films. The Soul Collector does a lot well, though the lack of subtitles during non-english parts was a bit of a roadblock."
The Soul Collector,73,77,audience,"this was pretty good; the creature thing peeking out the bag was creepy & i did enjoy the story. there was just a LOT of story. it's pretty slow/not much happens, but the beggining & end were good. it wasn't until i started reading other people's reviews that there's apparently a twist at the end... not sure i'd call that a twist. if so, it's a pretty predictable one (which kind of negates it)."
The Soul Collector,73,77,audience,"Overall, as a directional debut, I am genuinely impressed by this film. It's quite mysterious, and I enjoyed how dark this film was. Performances are pleasing, particularly from actor Tshamano Sebe who plays The Soul Collector named Lazarus. Visually, this film is also pleasing and carries an impressive audio track. The movie exceeded my expectations, and I look forward to the director's next film, which I'll gladly support in advance. The Soul Collector is easy to recommend for those seeking a new style of horror film.  - Walkden Entertainment"
The Soul Collector,73,77,audience,"Pretty unique and badass little horror flick, that offers some really unsettling images and ideas. It features an antagonist that's more three-dimensional than most movies offer in their main characters. "

The Soul Collector,73,77,audience,Not your typical horror film... Good twist towards the end.
The Soul Collector,73,77,critic,"
Holscher opts for a trick twist ending that feels both forced and unwarranted, and the only thing scary about it is that the director thought including it would be a good idea.
 "
The Soul Collector,73,77,critic,"
There's something eerie, and sometimes even dreadful at the heart of The Soul Collector.

There's a lot here that's worth checking out, and that far outweighs the issues I had with it.
 "
The Soul Collector,73,77,critic,"
Knowing when to be subtle and when to go all out, The Soul Collector is a refreshingly moody, tension-filled film, one that stands out and confidently offers viewers something they haven't seen since Richard Stanley's Dust Devil.
 "
The Soul Collector,73,77,critic,"
Though 8 lacks genre tropes and instead unfolds like a mysterious puzzle, the film fails to deliver on some of the story's more horrific elements.
 "
The Soul Collector,73,77,critic,"
While there's no denying the technical skill and beauty of 8, stories like this need to be told by those who live the culture, not the observer.
 "
The Soul Collector,73,77,critic,"
Since the script wants to initially put everything on Lazarus' shoulders, letting [the] evil exist beyond him to give others the benefit of the doubt seems an afterthought.
 "
The Soul Collector,73,77,critic,"
While [8] may lack scare factor, it's an unsettling western horror that gives off the same energy as the best ghost stories told under dim candlelight.
 "
The Soul Collector,73,77,critic,"
More intriguing for its unfamiliar setting than its action.
 "
The Soul Collector,73,77,critic,"
An atmospheric and enthralling mix of traditional terror and modern genre cinema.
 "
The Soul Collector,73,77,critic,"
Atmospheric and unsettling, 8 utilizes moody visuals and excellent sound design to deliver a satisfying folk-horror story that, while inconsistent, is worth a look.

Yourself and Yours,94,52,audience,"Long one take scenes that grow old when they don't work and are as real as anything you'll witness in cinema when they do.  The early scene in the bedroom made me think I was watching something special when in reality there was no connective tissue from there.  Hong Sang Soo adds to his lengthy filmography with a film based on relationships and when they go wrong.  After a 1st act that I couldn't look away from, we quickly learn this could have just as easily been a short film.  It just sits there and the plot stagnates.  What's the resolution?  Yea, about that.  Final Score: 5/10"
Yourself and Yours,94,52,audience,"Ignore the over-dramatic and over glamorization of Korean Soap Opera Drama and indulge in some small piece of South Korean Cinema that's more realist than aimed at popular crowds. Sang-soo Hong has made a very ordinary but relatable account of ordinary lives caught up in intermingling conflicts of domestic issues. Taking on the style of the not at all glamorous Sang-Soo's scripting even makes great use of it's actor's chemistry and structure throughout the film's run time. It's the type of Adult cinema older people would be more accustomed with even when coming from someone who is very well versed in South Korean Cinema of the noughties until today. I enjoyed the natural effect the film gave off as did the scripting and dialogue in particular, it just goes to show South Korean can make more contemporary tales without trying to be radical or glamorous."
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
Yourself and Yours, much funnier and seemingly breezy, really sticks around, its numerous complications and contradictions needling at the brain and refusing to settle on any one interpretation.

Hong Sang-soo returns with a recognisable mix in one of his most romantic films yet...
 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
Hong preserves mystery with grace, charm, and simplicity that enables us to stay open from beginning to end.
 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
Yourself and Yours works depending on whether or not you buy into its playful metaphors. For me, it is Hong's most relatable observation of love.
 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
That there are numerous ways to view her and the story makes it one of Hong's most powerful and engrossing films.
 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
One of Hong's most lovingly nuanced works, a film filled with longing and regret that finds great beauty in the in-between moments.
 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
It has a catchy droll humor, if nothing else.
 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
Pure romance, a woman going to bizarre and baffling lengths to get the man she wants, as much The Lady Eve or A Woman is a Woman as That Obscure Object of Desire.
 "

I found myself engaged and entertained watching these individuals explore and embrace important realizations that will serve them well and that offer vital reminders for all of us.

 "

 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"

 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
An exhausting, and mostly frustrating display of emotional scab-picking.
 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
Hong's formal confidence yields a movie that's very simply constructed and utterly engrossing.
 "

The dialogue is as sharp and multifaceted as ever, and the supporting work provides quite a bit of levity.

 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
Witty, strange and hard.
 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
... Yourself and Yours is closer to a Rohmerian moral tale, with a single narrative track containing a situation that leads to personal self-discovery.
 "
Yourself and Yours,94,52,critic,"
By re-asserting Min-jung's agency throughout, Hong toys with those who accuse him of complacency. Here behavioural response and re-evaluation is felt, rather than studied.
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,audience,"Debt Collectors (2020) is bloody good fun.  This sequel to the 2018's The Debt Collector, picks up shortly after the explosive end of the original film.  A nearly healed French and Sue are reunited for a few final debt collections for their old boss, Tommy, (Vladimir Kulich skillfully reprising the role), as a payback for saving their lives.  In the tradition of its predecessor, the duo's journey to Las Vegas and back to Los Angeles is fraught with obstacles and adversity as vehicles for the film's bone-crushing action sequences.  As the story unfolds we learn that these jobs are more than they appear to be, and have a dangerous connection to their deceased nemesis, Barbosa.

Debt Collectors defies the typical notion that ""buddy films"" have to be formulaic to be successful.  Furthermore, it defies the convention that sequels are rarely as good, or even better than, their predecessors.   Debt Collectors is fun, explosive, well-scripted, and well directed movie in its own right.  As a stand alone it equals, or surpasses The Debt Collector, as a film.  Jesse V. Johnson, together with Scott Adkins,  have carved out a niche' as filmmakers that have elevated the action film from a genre where the script and dialogue are ancillary.  Their films elevate the elements that support the action and fight choreography as holistic and indistinguishable elements of a great film.

The choice to call this film Debt Collectors, instead of  The Debt Collector 2, was curious to me prior to seeing the film; however, after seeing the film the choice seems warranted.   While the first film featured both Adkins and Louis Mandylor in co-starring roles, the film was, essentially, all Adkins.  The story was built around Adkins as a struggling martial artist making a foray into a new and more dangerous line of work, including the physical and moral struggles he faced.   In the sequel Louis Mandylor adds depth and heart to the performance he gave in the first film and emerges as a multi-dimensional, sympathetic, and complex character.  His performance is so engaging that when he takes his lumps, and he takes many, the audience can't help but cringe in pain.  The film also showcases, in a larger way, Sue's fighting skills and grit as his physicality is showcased in a broader way than was displayed in the prior film.

The fights, and fight choreography, do not disappoint.  In Johnson and Adkins movies there is an expectation that fights will be brutal, realistic, and well-choreographed.  Debt Collectors is no exception to that rule.  The fights, and the action, are all top level.  

The chemistry between French and Sue is what fuels the success of these two films.  The well-timed use of humor, contrasted by the action and violence all work well to make these two unlikely heroes appealing and relatable.  The supporting cast, including Marina Siritis and Mayling Ng, all serve the film well. I could easily see interest in a third film in the franchise.

Debt Collectors hits DVD and streaming services on May 29th.  I highly recommend it.  In fact, during this time when people are consuming more video content, I recommend you make a double-feature of it.  Watch these two films back-to-back.  They are worth the investment of your time."
Debt Collectors,82,,audience,Nice movie hope there is a part 3 
Debt Collectors,82,,audience,"Debt Collector And Debt Collector 2 (aka Debt Collectors in some markets) are B movie gems available on netflix.   The first one starts off as a martial arts film then morphs into old couple riff blended with a send up of 1970s style mob flick.    Louis Mandylor channels 1990s era Bruce Willis.  Scott Adkins shows off his martial arts (of course) but manages to impress with his comedy work.  The script for both films are hoot and the actors play off each other brilliantly.  Its violent, crash, and filled with in jokes (google the movie poster that is plot point in the films for example).   Both films end with over-the-top gun battles that don't work or really fit, but if you are nostalgic for 1990s rental action flicks ...these are great double bill. Dir. Jesse V. Johnson has made a ton of films...but these are two of his best.  Debt Collector (3  1/2 stars out of 5 ) Debt Collector 2 (3 out of 5 stars)."
Debt Collectors,82,,audience,A passable action thriller just about held together by it's two leads. The rest of the performances are pretty dire.
Debt Collectors,82,,audience,"The beginning showed that guy acting cool, strutting and shuffling his feet, really made me laugh! Then the bar fight set the tone of a bad movie. I stopped watching before the fight was over."
Debt Collectors,82,,audience,Carbon copy of the first one. Back to back movie night anyone?
Debt Collectors,82,,audience,"Turn off your brain for this one. Doesn't do the first one justice. Lots of bad cuts in the edit, Fight choreo is was hit and miss, sub par at best for the actors chosen to support the 2 leads. You can see they hired actors who were more ""affordable"". Lazy writing and missed timing on punch lines for jokes, lots of cheddar. Scott Adkins performed well enough along with his partner in crime played by Louis Mandylor. The story was basic and recycled also there was no progression with the main characters throughout the movie so you do not get connected or invested in them. Some clean cinematography. If you have nothing better to watch at night then give it a chance but you may end up playing on your phone and just having it play in the background. Anyways on to the next one!"
Debt Collectors,82,,audience,"I'm so tired of fight scenes where if they were happening in real life would last maybe three blows. Maybe. Here they hit each other twenty times. In real life, broken bones in the face, arms, hands, legs, internal damage, unconsciousness, death, from guys we're to understand hit like these guys do. It's a cartoon, and I can't stand it anymore. There are at least fifteen shots in this movie that would stop pretty much anyone first blow. Other than that, it's a shallow affair with no real connection or emotion. They try, but it barely scratches the surface. So fighting that is 100% unrealistic, and not very exciting either, just more of the same, and all but zero emotional resonance. There you have it."
Debt Collectors,82,,audience,I doubt many people were looking forward to a sequel to the debt collector but the debt collectors is here. And it’s pretty much low budget experience you would expect. It’s not one of the better Scott Adkins movies it features mainly bickering dialogue and dull action seasons. There’s nothing about this movie that’s memorable I saw yesterday and I even have a hard time remembering what it was about. It’s a forgettable film and only diehard Scott Adkins fans really need to apply.
Debt Collectors,82,,audience,Good Scott Adkins movie.
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
Everyone else will have to put up with a surprisingly and disappointingly tame reunion for both French and Sue and Adkins and Johnson; ironically enough, what Debt Collectors fails to drum up is any kind of interest.
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
As a sequel, it's full-on fantastic, ably expanding - and deftly improving - 2018's The Debt Collector.
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
Nothing fancy, but the action choreography is thrilling and brutal. [Full review in French]
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
Debt Collectors is only a bit more where The Debt Collector came from: this sequel has all of its predecessor's eccentricities, but none of its breezy confidence.
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
Action movies used to be all about this, the gritty scuffles and foot chases between characters who had opposing desires. It still works now although nobody had moves like Adkins in the '80s so it still feels bigger.
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
[Director Jesse V.] Johnson, a former stuntman, knows exactly how to get the best out of his physically-minded casts and can be counted on to bring the best, and most varied performances, out of Adkins.
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
An old-school action flick with plenty of bashing and brotherhood.
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
You owe yourself the fun of the 'Debt Collectors' action movies.
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
Adkins' growing legion of fans will enjoy getting more of the same, and newcomers will get a solid sampler of what Adkins and Johnson have to offer.
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
A fun storyline with a few casting surprises and some (obviously) great action makes Debt Collectors exactly the kind of romp you're hoping for.
 "
Debt Collectors,82,,critic,"
Another success on the Johnson and Adkins bandwagon, Debt Collectors is the best action film of the year so far and it does what it does incredibly well.
 "
Villain,71,,audience,Surprisingly better than I expected. Villain is a well-crafted suspenseful thriller with good actors and an intriguing plot.
Villain,71,,audience,Formulaic but well acted and gritty 'ex-con tries to go straight' thriller.
Villain,71,,audience,"There is nothing in this film that you haven't seen a dozen times elsewhere. It is a cut and paste collection of genre clichés assembled in a competent, if occasionally boring, fashion. The story is entirely predictable so it does not demand total attention, a good film to watch in the background if you are multitasking."
Villain,71,,audience,"This movie was bollocks from start to finish. They should have named it ""Stupid Criminal"". As bad as they tried to make the main character a badass, he was on his back way to much for that."
Villain,71,,audience,Great movie shows the reality that not all crime movies have a good ending
Villain,71,,audience,"Very well done. You can say it's nothing new, but whenever people truly commit with talent like this, you get a special and unique piece of work."
Villain,71,,audience,Excellent all around. Fantastic acting from all. The slow pacing was an excellent way of building tension as you know something major is going to go down and you are not real sure who will win in the end.
Villain,71,,audience,"The cast give great performances in the film with my standouts being George Russo as Sean who plays the role of the ‘screwup' brilliantly with his puppydog ‘okay i know ive made mistakes' eyes which of course has a knock on effect for his brother Eddie played by Craig Fairbrass.   Sean and Eddie are a great pairing and are of course is the main plot point of the story primarily following  Eddie as he gets out of jail to begin a quiet life but quickly finding out that things havent been as well looked after as they should have been by Sean. And thats an understatement. Eddie is most certainly not having a great time on the ‘outside'

My second standout is Izuka Hoyle (Mary Queen of Scots,Jerk and who will be seen in the future film Boiling Point) as Chloe Franks. Whilst she only has a few scenes in the film, each one is pivotal to a very emotional side plot in the film and gives several of the characters motivation for their own plot points)  Izuka is definitely an actor to keep an eye on and is a great addition to Villain

The real star of the film for me is Director Philip Barantini who I have seen a lot on screen over the years in the classic HBO series ‘Band Of Brothers' and Chernobyl and also in one of my favourite UK films ‘Hard Boiled Sweets', to name just a small amount of his appearances. Whilst Philip has filmed a couple of  short films in the past year, I was very excited to see what a Directed by Philip Barantini feature film would look like and I have to say (well I dont HAVE to, but I want to) I was wonderfully impressed and cant wait to see Boiling Point, which is in pre-production and will see Philip reunite with Izuka, but also add Jason Isaacs and Stephen Graham to the cast list."
Villain,71,,audience,Absolutely wonderful.
Villain,71,,audience,"Wow, now that was a good movie! I didn't expect that at all! A great watch!"
Villain,71,,critic,"
Over-familiar gangland lullaby worth a sit-thru, if not worth one's undivided attention.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
A predictable gangster family revenge film makes good.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
A motion picture of folk-art integrity and conviction of sensibility, done by a band of outsiders with something to prove - a debutant out to make a mark and a leading-man showing that, sure, he can crack a skull, but he can break a heart too.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
Fairbrass plays sad and desperate with as much authority as he does tough and menacing, delivering one of the best turns in his prolific career while doing so.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
It has an intensity and energy that's explosive.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
The latest story of an ex-con trying to go straight, this British drama takes a more character-driven approach yet doesn't find anything new to say about rehabilitation or recidivism.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
While Villain probably will not be considered a classic by any standards, it does provide 97 minutes of reasonably sold entertainment and at this point, who could ask for anything more?
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
Nobody in this movie has a complex inner emotional life, so it's not surprising that the movie's ending is ridiculous.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
I wouldn't call Villain a classic but director Philip Barantini hits most of the right notes.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
Brisk yet flavorful, gritty even when stylish, its occasional plot-logic leap smoothed over by a tone that deftly balances a resigned good humor with violent threat...
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
Fairbrass' performance, hardened but vulnerable, is as effectively frill-less as the film itself.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
Almost defiantly old-school, like its protagonist-which is both a virtue and a weakness: it's solid, but also a mite stolid.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
with Fairbrass and the solid supporting cast, the filmmaker pulls off a well-told story with a sympathetic lead.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
Would probably be a better film if it wasn't so preoccupied diligently following the Carlito's Way playbook on how to make a gangster film.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
Any movie containing the line ""You need to grab that hacksaw and start on his legs"" is already halfway to winning me over, and Philip Barantini's ""Villain"" does not disappoint.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
A compellingly emotional journey, boosted by a terrific turn from Fairbrass.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
Standard genre material brought to life by a quietly compelling performance.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
a gritty English gangster film that, while covering no new ground, is steeped in local atmosphere and a sympathetic performance from Fairbrass...
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
When some excitement does arrive, the ensuing fisticuffs are about as easy to follow as the gruff accents.
 "
Villain,71,,critic,"
A muted Fairbrass does some good on-camera brooding, but the character and the film never feel like more than a paper-thin pose.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,audience,"Excellente movie. Excellent performances, very good script, good plot, good thriller, it doesn't need a lot of special effects or a big budget to be entertaining. the movie catch you from start to finish."
Arkansas,47,52,audience,Good cool southern movie.
Arkansas,47,52,audience,"Getting into the business.  So this is about big-time drug dealers in Arkansas.  There is a hierarchy in the occupation, and at the top of the pyramid is a man named Frog (Vince Vaughn).  Two up-and-comers (Liam Hemsworth, Clark Duke) are starting to prove themselves, but they have yet to meet the man in charge.  This story is about how they get pulled deeper into the business.  Now I love a crime story about criminals that are less than intelligent.  The South makes a perfect setting for this, and it was already expertly handled in The Death of Dick Long.  I hadn't heard any great word of mouth on this, but I still wanted to give it a shot.  I feel like this movie showed potential, but it never quite came together for me.  Arkansas is the feature-length debut from Clark Duke.  If you don't recognize the name, he is better known for his work in Hot Tub Time Machine and the last season of U.S. The Office.  To speak kindly, I think he does show some promise as a director.  I like his choice of camera shots and angles in this, and I would like to see him helm more films.  That said, I don't think that he needs to star in anything else he directs.  That was a negative on my scorecard.  His partner as played by Liam Hemsworth comes away from this looking the best, but for Duke, it was just an odd character choice to wear sunglasses for 80% of this movie.  It was honestly distracting for me, and I don't know if he was trying to give himself more confidence, but it didn't work.  There are some bigger name actors in this.  I already mentioned Vince Vaughn, but you've also got John Malkovich, Michael Kenneth Williams, and Vivica A. Fox.  They're all okay, but it's nothing you're going to remember after the fact.  This story is divvied up into five chapters, and I feel like it disjoints the story too much.  Characters will drop out between segments, and because there are several flashbacks on top of that, the movie never establishes flow.  I think this would stand a better chance of succeeding as a miniseries; if they gave this the Fargo treatment, I could see this working, but I think it is safe to say that will never happen.  I was never bored with Arkansas, but it never rises to be greater than the sum of its parts.  I'm going to mostly forget about this because it isn't all that memorable, and I'm sure if I ever cross paths with this movie later down the line, I will foggily ask myself, ""did I watch this?""  This is an okay movie, but frankly speaking, there are much better movies that you can be watching."
Arkansas,47,52,audience,"Maybe the worst movie I've watched to the end in years. The film has no hope from the beginning with Clark Duke's idiotic character. You know it as soon as he's introduced. The movie is ruined at that point ! And to describe it as neo-noir is like describing ""Lady and the Tramp' as a 'sultry lustful affair'. Anyone involved in this film should be embarrassed."
Arkansas,47,52,audience,Good movie - lots of action
Arkansas,47,52,audience,"I loved it! Such a cool, interesting movie! Good story and good acting, that's really what makes a good movie."
Arkansas,47,52,audience,found myself picking my phone up in quite a few places - I never did that when I first watched The Usual Suspects.. but then I didn't have a phone
Arkansas,47,52,audience,Absolute garbage. Very disappointed great way to butcher a decent cast.
Arkansas,47,52,audience,"Based on John Brandon's novel, actor-turned-director, Clark Duke's (The Office US) debut feature is a Tarantino-esque Dixie American noir that's inhabited by characters who have migrated over from an early Coen Brothers movie. The story thrives in random, perhaps contrived if one's cynically inclined, narrative twists and developments, that propel the film in ways that feels outlandish and slightly odd – but once you get into its rhythm, and seasoned film-goers will as it is a somewhat familiar one, its kookiness becomes somewhat less surprising and impactful. There's a two prong approach here, one centres on the lower end of the criminal syndicate with Liam Hemsworth's handsome but stoic Kyle and Clark's Swin, whose offbeat name pretty much defines his entire character, who find themselves working under John Malkovich's Ranger Bright (another bizarre creation that only he can get away with); and the other prong flashes back to chart the beginnings of their boss, the mysteriously named Frog, and how all the various borderline-whimsical characters' paths finally cross each other at the film's climax. The chaptering structure and the frequent use of voice-overs belie the difficulty it has shaking its literary origins and can feel like watching an audio-book at times; but despite its derivativeness and characters that may have mistaken eccentricity for characterisation, there is something intriguing enough here that kept my engagement. It's nicely put together and the witty and assured screenplay thankfully resisted the temptation to pander to its audience by sticking to a more credible but bittersweet ending – which is basically me saying that I kinda enjoyed this silly B-movie despite everything."
Arkansas,47,52,audience,"Trama abbastanza originale e grande cast rendono il film interessante.
Si sente però la mancanza di ritmo, anche nel momento dei colpi di scena, il guizzo non è mai presente; le pulsazioni restano le stesse."
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
Arkansas is a blend of affectionate, easy going and satisfying - not something I expected to write regarding a film focusing on American drug-runners.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
Think of it as a Southern-fried drug running, violent yet funny stepbrother of a Cohen Brothers movie. The performances are solid but the movie itself isn't award-winning.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
Like most dark comedies in the same vein as Fargo, trouble in 'Arkansas' starts with one body and goes downhill until Frog himself has to step in to deal with things. And, no one wants that.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
Arkansas is a try-hard exercise in overly self-aware cleverness.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
Despite the strong cast, Arkansas is mostly just recycled scenarios from better movies that fail to create much of an original impact when strung together.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
[T]his offbeat crime movie loses momentum and focus because the lengthy flashbacks take away from the here and now.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
A real disappointment.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
Feeling like a relic from the wave of '90s crime ensembles that followed in Tarantino's wake, Arkansas not only squanders some good talent, it's a tragic waste of a fine book.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
As a collection of smart-mouthed southern ne'er-do-wells, Arkansas amuses, but as a showcase for colourful 70s menswear, it excels.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
Finds its stride in its offbeat quirkiness featuring a five-act structure that juggles its goofy characters and mixes up criss-crossing timelines in a meandering road trip soup right out of the Joel and Ethan Coen playbook.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
Arkansas in many ways feels more like a play or a talk show than a movie, and... it can be very funny when there doesn't seem much to laugh at.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
'Arkansas' is obnoxious, faux-quirky, and too clever by half. It feels like it was lifted directly from the wave of post-'Pulp Fiction' scuzz movies that arose in the late 1990s, but without the wit.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
The best way I can describe this film is it's a Southern-fried thriller by way of Fargo.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
An atmospheric and at times darkly hilarious Southern crime picture, and one of the better films to arrive in the quarantine era.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
What could have been a menacing mystery ends up being little better than a quirky pickle or two.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
While Arkansas may have aspired to have some Coen Brothers or Quentin Tarantino-esque flavor, Clark Duke's first outing is an uneven, at times entertaining, and often exasperating, corn-pone crime-drama.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
With its brooding tone of tired inevitability, his Arkansas knows exactly how to find drama and sentiment in what could otherwise just be a dour path to the inevitable.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
It's quirky, lively, and diverting for a little while, but then it really just drags.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
[Clark Duke] shows some promise as a director and maybe even more so as a screenwriter, but it goes on too long, it is unevenly paced, and it seems to end a few times.
 "
Arkansas,47,52,critic,"
Somehow it does have a sort of distinctive tang... It doesn't quite add up to a full meal despite being overlong, but it has a kind of ambling, affectionate weirdness to it.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,audience,Deerskin is a decent film. It is about a man's obsession with his designer deerskin jacket that causes him to blow his life savings and turn to crime. Jean Dujardin and Adele Haelen give good performances. The script is a little slow in places. Quentin Dupieux did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the humor.
Deerskin,88,68,audience,Starts good then fizzles. Tries to be a comedy and a horror movie. It fails on both. Big waste of time..
Deerskin,88,68,audience,"Like Dupieux's Rubber, Deerskin is a wonderfully strange and hypnotically funny psycho-thriller with ideas bigger than its budget. The dangerous pursuit for recognition, the overwhelming obsession for originality, the romanticizing of the wild west, the personal peril of unchecked masculinity. Mostly, it's an endlessly compelling study of a truly unique psychopath, played by Dujardin with a droll, disarming creepiness. A steady and enveloping descent into madness."
Deerskin,88,68,audience,Stupid stupid stupid.  Waste of time.
Deerskin,88,68,audience,"Deerskin is a strange, absurd, surreal film. A small film that does to enough to keep you entertained even if feeling a little slight. At a breezy 77 minutes it's intriguing and beguiling, enough to keep you locked in. This weird little film is from French director Quentin Dupieux and stars Jean Dujardin as Georges, a man of mystery who starts the film spending a lot of money buying a deerskin jacket. Soon he is driving to a small French town where he holes himself up and meets Denise, a bar maid in the hotel. The plot of this short film is quite bizarre but here goes. As he tries to find more deerskin to wear he has a plan to rid the world of all other jackets. The jacket also 'talks' to him. Of course it's not all meant to be taken seriously. It's an absurd story designed purely I think to entertain and befuddle with its dark comedy. It might be slight but it's definitely worth a look. And the biggest strength is the charisma and acting chops of the two leads. Dujardin and Adele Haenel, who lights up the screen. For this alone the film makes for a worthwhile adventure."
Deerskin,88,68,audience,"Overall, what Deerskin delivers is a fantastic slice of cinema with an incredible and unforgettable performance by Jean Dujardin. I found myself quite fond of the unique directing style by Quentin Dupieux as he delivers a plot which is unlike anything I have seen before. Deerskin is loaded with fun and surprising moments, and is unpredictable at every turn including the horror aspects. I most certainly enjoyed this film and every moment of it and I cannot wait until I have the opportunity to watch it again. - Walkden Entertainment"
Deerskin,88,68,audience,"A quirky, satirical, black comedy that isn't funny — at least, it didn't make me laugh. It might have been better as a short, but it doesn't work for a full length feature film. The acting is ok, especially from Adèle Haenel (Portrait of a Lady on Fire). It's very slow and very superficial in its attempts to explore its themes of narcissism and obsession. Tedious."
Deerskin,88,68,audience,"The French film 'Deerskin' is a hard film to categorize, but the filmmakers call it a comedy horror film so we'll stick with that!  If you watch this movie just do so for the score.  Lovely and tense and it builds like the film does.  I liked this.  It's 76 minutes and it's not a moment too long.  It's a farce, it's absurd, and in a moment or two it's funny.  You should know how you feel about this very quickly.  It's a feature long gag and your mileage may vary if it works for you.  Final Score:  7.7/10"
Deerskin,88,68,audience,"Writer and director Quentin Dupieux's comedic horror film does rely heavily on audiences to read between the lines and metaphorically interpret his screenplay in order for it to work as is surely intended. Thankfully, this critical component of the film was something that drew considerable interest from me. There's no question that Georges' unsettling behaviour and actions take the film to downright daring territory. For instance, the more unhinged Georges becomes, the grislier the comedic elements grow with it. When humour is to be derived from the unstable mind of a person with a propensity for violence, execution is absolutely vital in order to gain the intended reaction. These developments in the film not only make it even more of an acquired taste than it already was, but aren't well executed either. I say this partially due to not being overly amused, but largely because the script rapidly accumulates a number of improbabilities that cannot be ignored. Admittedly and simultaneously, Deerskin does maintain and even builds curiosity pertaining to the trajectory of its other primary character, Denise, but leaves us with a finale that I found puzzling."
Deerskin,88,68,audience,Fuck. 100% killer style.
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
Don't be fooled by Deerskin's innate listlessness - it's a trap, waiting to be sprung in a wild and genre-hopping third act.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
A bizarre, off-centre, singularly demented pitch-black comedy...it's superbly mounted by writer/director Quentin Dupieux, whose sense of the deranged is dispatched with a cool matter-of-fact air that makes the proceedings as disturbing as they are funny.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
David Lynch might have directed Deerskin as if it were a dream; others might have treated it as a farce. Dupieux keeps a straight face.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
It seems a perfectly natural move to become a serial killer, ready to dispose of anyone who refuses to hand over their jacket.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
Dujardin is pretty good, considering that even he occasionally seems unsure what kind of movie he's actually in...
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
It is the kind of wonderful gem one finds late at night at some film festival: never to be seen again, always to be fondly remembered, and met with incredulity when explained to other film enthusiasts year down the track.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
This is a willfully dumbed-down, emptied-out version of Hitchcock, as if the goal were to prove that the mechanisms of suspense still appeal to the lizard brain no matter how stupid the overt ""content"".

Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
The two of them develop an engaging, twisted chemistry. To say more would be to spoil, except that the film is gorgeous to look at, and not actually about a jacket.

Coming off like an unbridled hybrid of a lost Twilight Zone episode, an R-rated Monty Python sketch, and a slasher movie by way of Quentin Tarantino

Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
Jean Dujardin leans into lunacy in a marriage of the bizarre and the barking mad.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
The only thing you need to understand or appreciate here is that Dupieux wanted to tell the story of a jacket that compels its owner to kill people, and to that end, has succeeded.

An absurdist riff on Hollywood's toxic narratives of masculinity and machismo
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
This slyly paranoid art film proposes what cannot be put back in order -- or, as an amateur filmmaker might think, rectified by pressing a rewind button. It defies back-to-roots, back-to-nature aspirations and so goes forward into murderous madness.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
Deerskin is completely bizarre. A story that baffles as much as it intrigues, but it is carried off flawlessly by Jean Dujardin who is selling the hell out of it.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
Deerskin works on two levels: as a hilarious and creepy pitch-black comedy, and also as a film rich in allegorical meaning.

Brisk - just 77 minutes - and delightfully peculiar, ""Deerskin"" is a must-see for anyone who adores absurdist cinema.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
If there's a weakness in ""Deerskin,"" it's an underwhelming final payoff - but, considering how Dupieux's fascinating set-up paints the movie into a corner, perhaps no ending would have worked.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
A closed bank account, an epiphany, a wearable trophy of a suit of armor and off to the races.
 "
Deerskin,88,68,critic,"
This horror comedy is bizarre to be sure, featuring Jean Dujardin's best deadpan performance. There's also an intriguing, even suspenseful, shift between him and Adèle Haenel's character as to who is actually in control.

The Wretched,75,46,audience,"Don't let the first 5 minutes fool you, the next 90 minutes are painfull to try to sit through. All the characters are poorly written, superficial and feel fake. Adults are infuriatingly oblivious (and not even in the fun horror trope way, just lazy writing).

I'd rather slam my hand in a car door then watch this movie again, and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy."
The Wretched,75,46,audience,The movie is great as it offers a witchy supernatural beast that will give you wendigo/succubus vibes. The added thrill of not knowing who could be one adds more excitement to the body snatcher theme- however it falls short when you begin to overthink this creepy beast has to maintain a normal life of chores and picking out a wardrobe. Kind of makes you wish that it was more toward creepy night stalker like in the beginning instead of possessed lover by the end.
The Wretched,75,46,audience,"Another one that I just wasn't as floored by as everyone else seemed to be. It's a serviceable little horror flick, with some interesting ideas at play, and admittedly some cool visuals, but it just didn't engage me. I mean, it's only been a couple weeks and it's almost completely wiped from my memory..."
The Wretched,75,46,audience,Just a teenage horror movie. File under: not scary
The Wretched,75,46,audience,"Overall, The Wretched is a positive low budget horror. It gets a lot of things right, and many moments feel fresh. Elements such as the visuals and the audio track were outstanding. It's unfortunate to see some of the performances and the slow start regarding the plot. Nevertheless, it's an impressive horror film, and those seeking new chills and thrills should support this film - Walkden Entertainment"
The Wretched,75,46,audience,Standard teen horror flick. Entertaining to pass the time. Better than expected. There's nothing scary and there's no jump scares. It feels like Disney Channel teens mixed with Goosebumps looking for a witch that looks like The Ring.
The Wretched,75,46,audience,"First you set up some characters, make us like them, care about them ... then you can put them under stress and tear their limbs off.
This film sets up characters so weak and one-dimensional that they're barely distinguishable from the background; when they are, they're unmemorable, predictable, weak and unlikeable. I was quite happy for them all to get eaten as none had any value to me."
The Wretched,75,46,audience,"Weak story, plot, acting, etc. They tried to keep it interesting but it just kept failing. "
The Wretched,75,46,audience,"I was actually very surprised, turned out to be a really good movie."
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
There isn't a single twist you won't see coming, but underneath its PG-13 veneer are some nasty R-rated surprises that elevate it above standard horror fare.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
It had a lot of positives, but also a lot of flaws.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
The dressings may feel a little familiar, but there is no doubt that the supernatural threat at its centre is an imaginative and aptly terrifying creation.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
An occult horror movie possessed by the spirit of teen seaside summers past. Hidden in their troubled co-existence is a potentially much better but eventually unrealised film...If Hitchcock dials S for suspense, the Pierce Brothers dial S for serviceable.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
...it's not the most scary, but in the right frame of mind and without any spoilers, it should make for a fun night of scares.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
Borrows from some of the best seminal monster movies, surely exciting fans of the subgenre, though fails to offer anything new to the formula.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
You can probably guess where it's headed early on, but the film still works serviceably well as yet another horror spin on Rear Window.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
The atmosphere is eerie and there's a nice twist I did not see coming.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
An elegantly executed B-movie. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
The Wretched is a smaller budget horror film, but it's firing on all cylinders throughout its run-time.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
It is hard to think of a recent horror movie that was as shocking yet as routine as The Wretched.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
The Wretched (written and directed by brothers Brett Pierce and Drew Pierce) devolves into an incoherent mess in the last 20 minutes of the film, thereby wasting the potential that it had in the beginning of the story.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
Fun, plain and simple. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
There are times in this movie where the character arcs hinder it from reaching the great potential it seeks. However, there is enough here to complete a satisfying and generally interesting horror film once The Wretched decides what it wants to be.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
Proves the slightest of twists and turns in a familiar tale is enough to derive genre-specific pleasure
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
An effective, efficient creepfest.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
...a mostly entertaining, occasionally imaginative, bit of escapist genre fluff.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
The Wretched's old-school approach should please genre enthusiasts, but its trope-heavy framework derails Brett and Drew Pierce's promising low-budget craftsmanship.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
Slick and polished, with enough gore and excellent creature effects to satiate horror fans, much of ""The Wretched"" is solid if standard genre fare.
 "
The Wretched,75,46,critic,"
Ultimately, however, The Wretched is a dark and downright spooky fairy tale that balances fun and scary with precision. Pair this up with Pyewacket and you're in for one hell of a witchy weekend.
 "
Swallow,87,72,audience,"Sleek direction, top-notch acting, affecting and non-manichean plotline... Why isn't this movie more talked about?"
Swallow,87,72,audience,"Caution spoilers! The title is deceptive about the true content of the film. It is not primarily about a mental illness, but about who is supposedly to blame for the illness of the main protagonist. That is, of course, once again ""old white men"" and ""white men"". Absolution is given after the father is married to a person of color and also has a child with her. The makers of the film are not bothered when the white child, which was born out of an act of love, is aborted at the end. The main thing is one less capitalist! The male Syrian nurse gives this political dazzle work then the last rest. Shame on you for this scrap. Excluded from my criticism are the actors - a good job especially by Haley Bennett."
Swallow,87,72,audience,"Showing the danger of a ""safe relationship"" in which you have no control over your own life."
Swallow,87,72,audience,"I cringed from the beginning until the end, was also fascinated.  Her mental struggle was appealing and I rooted for her all along.  I love the way the movie was shot with quick cuts to each next scene."
Swallow,87,72,audience,"Swallow starts simple, delighting our eyes thanks to the outstanding camera work. The story then gets problematic, causing good suspense. And it was great suspense, I even had the feeling that someone was gonna die, as it had sparks of horror. I also started realising that this film had potential to give some twists, like an unpredictable ending. And, well, it certainly was, although it kinda felt incomplete."
Swallow,87,72,audience,"Please give me a way to give negative infinite stars for this-  so bad it wants to be funny but succeeds only sometimes in its ineptitude- the baseline typical feminist agenda, degrading men as usual (the norm for these days.) 

Allow me to surmise-- a suburbanite feminist soccer mom, women are Jesus and men are Satan movie, told only slightly better over 100 years ago by Kate (read karen) Chopin in her ""groundbreaking"" story ""the awakening."" A silly little story that amounted to Basically nothing except for the female privilege.  Enjoy those bathrooms, ladies."
Swallow,87,72,audience,"Talk about one dimensional. also it appears this movie was shot in a zero contamination world. Move past this one, it's hard to swallow. Sorry about that."
Swallow,87,72,audience,"So bad.. just don't, I mean seriously, don't. I can't think of one redeeming quality."
Swallow,87,72,audience,"It is definitely not for everyone. Story is bizarre, to say the least. Graphic operation details and toilet scenes may disgust some viewers. I still enjoyed it, however."
Swallow,87,72,audience,"This was a good one - accurate, fresh, and haunting. Very realistic. Production design was also great."
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
Swallow has all the makings of a great, unsettling film, but the only things that go below the surface are the objects that Hunter swallows. Too bad it plays it safe.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
Whatever.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
This is Bennett's show... It's a role you can imagine a young Isabelle Huppert playing, and there's no higher praise than that.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
Resembling a fledgling Michelle Williams, Bennett takes the construct of the film and makes it a living breathing animal.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
Bennett, who's been largely off the radar for a while, is heartbreaking and, eventually, fierce as her character begins to crave change.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
Thoughtfully shot and written, it leaves us on an uncertain note, but is all the more provocative for that.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
I only wish ""Swallow"" didn't hammer its themes home quite so hard, through dialogue, editing, and camerawork that never trust the audience to think for itself.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
It is a difficult and painful film to watch both in Hunter's manipulation and the physical consequences of pica, but it is a crucial text in portraying the nuance and individual experiences with mental illness.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
An exquisitely crafted film with an unconventional and unexpected heroine driving the story.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
Bennett gives a stunning performance as she embraces the complexities of this role, showing us a troubled young woman forced to peel away the many layers of denial she's used to cover up a deep sense of self-loathing.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
The truth is women continue to fight for control and ownership over their own bodies. It's a bitter pill to swallow, and Swallow doesn't sugar-coat it.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
It does attain some depth and punch in the end, yet the character writing is so thin these people seem like paper cutouts rather than recognizable, dimensionalized human beings.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
This film had me sobbing. Haley Bennett's performance is captivating.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
Swallow is able to not bite off more than it can chew as it provides unsettling commentary on the nature of toxic marriages.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
A rather provocative psychological thriller that highlights sharp observations on domestic life, lack of affection and emotional repression with a powerful performance from Haley Bennett. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
Swallow is true body-horror to the highest degree.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
Stylish psychological drama has self-harm, strong language.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
This unsettling drama initially feels like a distant cousin to those numerous ""body horror"" films conceived by David Cronenberg. Yet Swallow turns out to be more about emotional rather than physical anguish.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
A compelling and visually impressive fable anchored by a powerhouse lead performance by Haley Bennett.
 "
Swallow,87,72,critic,"
In her portrayal of this troubled soul, actress [Haley] Bennett does a chilling but impressive performance as someone who seems mild-mannered on the outside but has raging self-hatred on the inside.
 "
News of the World,88,89,audience,One of Tom Hanks worst movies did not enjoy this one
News of the World,88,89,audience,tom hanks and the girl did a great job acting but the story was too slow.
News of the World,88,89,audience,"Excellent! Loved it. Have to admit that I like Tom Hanks and all the recent movies he did for Apple TV+. Also this one.

Great plot in the post secession war US west. Military, cowboys, settlers, Indians, it has everything :-)"
News of the World,88,89,audience,Slow to start but you end up loving it by the end. 
News of the World,88,89,audience,Had to see this film as I saw the ad everywhere. Great film. Check it out!
News of the World,88,89,audience,Great movie overall the story was great but some times it got a little boring but I would still recommend it. The action scenes are pretty good but it’s one of Tom hanks lower movies but still good
News of the World,88,89,audience,It’s like a dramatic Western version of Paper Moon.
News of the World,88,89,audience,"One of the best revisionist Westerns I have seen so far.
I'd compare it with ""True Grit"" (Cohen, 2010); and it excels as a ""Bio-Western"" — life in it."
News of the World,88,89,audience,Enjoyable film. Well worth the watch.
News of the World,88,89,audience,"Perhaps not the most creative of films, but Tom Hanks remains as immensely likeable as ever. The story is told in a slightly episodic format, with no other characters apart from Hanks's and Zengel's appearing in more than a couple of scenes. This gives the two main leads an opportunity to really develop by themselves, and by the end it is almost impossible to care for both of them. Perhaps this development is predictable, but for a nice, feelgood tale it serves well. The conflict of the piece is lacking. You have a smattering of villains throughout, but none strike you at all and they feel empty. Overall though, very passable film."
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
Being Tom Hanks first Western, News of the World throws some classic genre tropes in the mix to deliver an emotional tale about two strangers forced to stay together against all obstacles in the midst of America's wild West era.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
Western about the healing power of storytelling and kindness as a spiritual practice.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
A good film, albeit a little predictable. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
Both the script and the staging end up yielding - in a complacent way - to a consoling denouement. [Full review in Spanish]

We may not be far from Delphi, or the temple of Apollo in whose pronaos ""know thyself"" is written, that News from the Great World wonderfully represents. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
The scenes of post-Civil War America are interesting, as is the whole concept of a man who supports himself through the public's eagerness to hear stories from around the world. Hanks is as likable as he has ever been.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
A beautifully crafted, no frills adventure which often feels like an homage to Westerns of yore.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
The heartfelt conclusion is... undermined by a simplistic build-up, albeit not enough to diminish the fine lead performances.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
A high-quality time-filler that might not stick in the memory like their previous collab Captain Phillips, but it's a fine piece of work.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
As perfectly cast and reliably great as Hanks is here, in the latest role that's likely to see awards nominations come his way, the empathetic and absorbing movie he's in meets him at every turn.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
News of the World travels slowly but it gets to where it needs to go in the wild west.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
Tom Hanks puts the 'man' in 'anchorman' in this thoughtful western.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
The movie benefits from having Greengrass at the helm. The director of films including the second two Bourne adventures, the excellent United 93 and 2013's Captain Phillips, which also starred Hanks, has a skilled storytelling hand.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
I found this a rewarding and entertaining drama, heavy with the weight of the past, yet buoyed up by the possibilities of the future.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
A stunning, rhythmic drama about what makes a home, a family and a country, set on a vast canvas that is anything but sprawling.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
The shallowness of the film's politics is mirrored in its road-movie structure, which fails to include either the exciting episodes or compelling protagonists of a good picaresque.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
Their journey packs in all the usual thrills of the genre - the shootouts and the ravenous jaws of nature - though Greengrass doesn't approach the material with the kineticism of Captain Phillips (also starring Hanks) or the Bourne films.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
Splendid, deep, eventually violent and issuer of a powerful thesis that doesn't understand about eras.
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
...a well-upholstered, engrossing Western in the old style...
 "
News of the World,88,89,critic,"
'News of the World' is Hanks' finest.
 "
76 Days,100,89,audience,"Perhaps too harsh and difficult to watch in 2020, but definitely touching and emotional. The makers captured with such sensibility, respect, and care the essence of these people giving everything they've got to save these other people, like on a battlefield. Proof there's still hope and good out there, despite the desperation, uncertainty, and trauma this ""thing"" has brought to us all."
76 Days,100,89,audience,"A hard form to watch but it must see.
It's a representation of what's happening in the hospitals all around the world but not able to see on a regular basis"
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
There are no hugely dramatic moments in 76 Days. It is wholly unsentimental and, allowing for the fact the stream of events must be put into some kind of narrative form, unmanipulative.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
Unforgettable, important and historically significant footage.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
From numerous small moments, it draws together an inspiring picture of collective effort to fight a disaster.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
Compelling and surprising, 76 Days is a seemingly apolitical yet oddly sanitised fly-on-the-wall documentary that puts you on the front lines of an eerily well-managed response to the coronavirus outbreak.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
This should be mandatory viewing for those who still think the coronavirus is a man made media exercise, designed to make pharmaceutical companies rich while economies flatline.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
Filled with raw emotion and selfless acts of humanity, it might lack the social and political punch of [Totally Under Control], but it's still brave, bravura and powerful film-making.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
Totally absorbing -- from the wildly frenetic start of the total lockdown in the city of 11 million to the film's mostly moving, bittersweet conclusion.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
The takeaway from this thing is...thank GOD for these people.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
This is primary evidence right from the source of history.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
An essential documentary... portraying the bravery of doctors during the pandemic. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
It stands alone in its ferocity.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
Filmed in hospitals in Wuhan during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, this documentary puts you right in the thick of things.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
Timing is everything in current affairs culture, and this intimate documentary account of the first 76 days of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan early last year is an illustrative case.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
Crucially, there's also an element of hope and even humour in this affecting tribute to healthcare workers everywhere.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
It is a terrible story, but, in its constant discovery of bravery and compassion, ultimately a hopeful one.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
The human cost of the pandemic has been statistical, a subject of graphs and tea time press conferences, if it hasn't touched you directly. 76 Days breaks through all of that.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
76 Days offers a raw portrait of the inner workings of a hospital's Intensive Care Unit over the course of the lockdown that was imposed on the 11 million residents living in what was quickly established as ground zero for the coronavirus.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
A riveting and powerful documentary about the bravery, resoluteness and empathy of medical staff.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
The result is less of an exposé than a straightforward video-diary, in which doctors and nurses are shown battling against a virus they aren't even sure how to contain, let alone treat.
 "
76 Days,100,89,critic,"
The result is a time capsule in waiting, a real-time record of medicine adapting to the viciously unknown.

Sound of Metal,96,91,audience,"There are a lot of good things about this film. To start with, the initial scenes where Ruben (played by Riz Ahmed) starts to realize that he is losing his hearing ability was emotionally breaking to watch. Watching Riz Ahmed as Ruben was just amazing. Riz has given a spectacular performance. The sound mixing and editing were outstanding. There were a lot of feel-good moments in the first half of the film. The thought of not using any background score in most parts of the film but instead having natural sounds play out like the breathing of the actors and chirruping of birds was mind-blowing. It also shows the various struggles faced by the deaf community and how they try to overcome them. The ending acts as icing on a cake. Brilliant performances along with the strong technical aspects and raising of awareness about the deaf community make Sound Of Metal a must-watch."
Sound of Metal,96,91,audience,Didn't really go anywhere. Plodded along and not much of a payoff.
Sound of Metal,96,91,audience,"Without treading too deep into familiar territory, sound of metal graciously commemorates the dead community with its authentic acting and sound design."
Sound of Metal,96,91,audience,"Excellent drama about finding tranquility when everything is in motion. Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci are both fantastic. It's a beautiful and sad tale, but not without hope. Great sound editing make this character study a profound piece and knowing deaf people, many of the messages hit close. The beginning is a little rocky, but things move quickly, and there were tears."
Sound of Metal,96,91,audience,"Riz Ahmed is outstanding. The sound design is too. I think it loses itself a little bit towards the end, but the first hour (and a bit) is nothing but heartbreaking, hopeful brilliance."
Sound of Metal,96,91,audience,"I'm not sure if I've ever heard such an amazing sound design before. It takes you down right into the agony the main character - a drummer that's losing his hearing - is going through. Riz Ahmed does an amazing job with his powerful, but yet intimate and sensitive performance, with a little help from the script, that doesn't fall on melodramatic grounds, and instead, it focuses on our main character's perspective and journey, delivering a solid, emotional drama, always sensitive and faithful to its subject matter."
Sound of Metal,96,91,audience,"La pelicula mas triste del 2020, es muy reflexiva para que tomemos consciencia de cuidar algunos de nuestros sentidos y que al perderlo como de destruidos o sin ganas de vivir llegariamos a sentirnos asi. Una obra maestra"
Sound of Metal,96,91,audience,Powerfully acted and sombre drama. I can't say it's one I'd be in a hurry to watch again though.
Sound of Metal,96,91,audience,"Interesting and engaging story without any false moves. Deafness is not included, let alone featured, in movies and it was so well depicted. Excellent acting."
Sound of Metal,96,91,audience,"A must watch film of this year 💯 The film explores the reluctant journey of a musician who loses his hearing 🎸 The cast brings out performances that are real and honest. Riz Ahmed beautifully captures the inner turmoil of a musician trying to finding acceptance in silence 🍃  Paul Raci brings a touching performance abounding with compassion ❤️. The editing and sound design is immersive and brings the audience into the perspective of a deaf man. Yet doesn't feel overdone as it maintains the perfect balance between the muffled ambience and natural clear sounds. 🔉 The direction and cinematography are subtle 📽️  Yet powerful, especially with the nature scenes 🌲. The film will leave you with a deeper appreciation for the people and silent moments in our lives 🕊️"

Sound of Metal prioritizes the emotional and physical reality of its subject above all else, combining an observational view of the deaf community with an immersive portrait of a man caught between loss and recovery.

An affecting story of hope, desperation, and the amorphous nature of addiction, Sound of Metal is without question one of the most beautiful films to release in the past year.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
It examines the vicissitudes of deafness with honesty and a truly meticulous performance from Riz Ahmed. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
With Oscar buzz surging for Riz Ahmed, the time is now to check out his virtuoso performance as a rock drummer facing deafness in a riveting, resonant film whose thrashing power and emotional gravity exert a grip that won't let go.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
Riz Ahmed's percussive performance as a heavy metal drummer losing his hearing is worth banging the drum for.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
Considering its delicate treatment of its subject matter and the performance of Ahmed, it really is one of the few must-sees so far in 2020.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
Ahmed's performance is beautifully rendered, as he expresses his character's alternating frustration and curiosity about his situation with subtlety rather than showy dramatics.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
A thoughtful, intelligent film with a great deal to say, Sound Of Metal is something special.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
Sound of Metal is essential viewing for anyone who considers themselves a fan of movies. With great acting, stellar technical aspects, and a message that's rarely illuminated in film, it's one of the best movies of the year.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
Sound of Metal is a compelling story with stellar performances and one of the most original sound design you've ever heard.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
...one of the best features I've seen lately, with one of the year's strongest male performances.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
Sound of Metal is specific in its setting, but ultimately is a story of accepting the curveballs life throws at you.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
With its thoughtful examination of the deaf community and its gripping soundscapes, [Sound of Metal] breathes new life into a conventional narrative, delivering a remarkably sensitive cinematic experience.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
There is a beautiful and breathtaking amount of compassion in Sound of Metal. A film that revolves around a man that must find a new purpose in life.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
Riz Ahmed stars in an aural, experiential film that creates its own esoteric audioscape.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
[Riz] Ahmed handles Ruben with both tender vulnerability and bulldozing assurance that teeters into complete loss of control.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
Ahmed's an absolutely unstoppable performer, deep wells of discipline and commitment coming out in a performance of passionate intensity and wounded vulnerability.
 "
Sound of Metal,96,91,critic,"
So much of the film rests on [Ahmed] selling you this man's experience with bare bones expressions. You get everything you need and then some.
 "
Collective,99,93,audience,"This film exposes the rotten corrupt health system in Romania like no other! It hurt to watch, it opens deep wounds in us who know how things work in Romania and hopefully motivates us fight for a change. I didn't enjoy watching it but I am sure glad it's there for everyone to see and expose the pus in the Romanian government."
Collective,99,93,audience,"Though the importance and vitality of what the journalism and unprecedented access unveils in Collective can't be pushed aside, I came out of this documentary with two very distinct reactions. The first was that I wanted more than anything to write a screenplay with an anti-hero as the main character who, as the audience becomes more sympathetic to them, the script pulls back to reveal the larger context our character is working in allowing for the realization that despite understanding their plight that the goal of this anti-hero is ultimately only to his own benefit whereas said larger context will reveal the number of human lives lost for this one individual's - the individual we feel the closest to - prosperity. Second was the fact watching movies and thinking critically about them may be the least important thing I could be dedicating my time to at the moment."
Collective,99,93,audience,"When a tragic 2015 fire in Bucharest's Colectiv nightclub killed 64 and injured 143, with 37 of the victims dying after the fact, primarily from hospital infections, the event launched a sweeping investigation into the Romanian health care system. This revelation, which was brought to light by a team of reporters from a daily sports journal of all things, led to the dissolution of the government and a probing look into the nation's hospital network, exposing system-wide corruption that had been in place long before the catalytic event that spurred this inquiry. ""Collective"" relates the unfolding of these events through unprecedented access to the journalists and reformers who sought to expose a system where patient care was secondary to the self-serving interests of politically connected administrators and their crooked affiliates. However, while director Alexander Nanau's impressive and authentic documentary is indeed a remarkable piece of investigative journalism, its raw footage approach to the presentation of its material is often dry and talky, failing to stoke the kind of outraged emotional response that a work like this should handily accomplish. It thus plays more like a radio report on film than an engaging cinematic presentation, diluting much of the impact that its findings should generate. Sadly, the victims of this tragedy truly deserve more, not only from the government that let them down, but also from the vehicle through which their story was told."
Collective,99,93,audience,"It's a reminder of what Communism was really like. Not the current propaganda being spread on social media, but the horrors people really lived through and with for 70 years. Not enough of these kinds of stories are told. Ask anyone under a communist regime if they ever want to have it back - and they'll tell you stories like this for hours."
Collective,99,93,audience,"What a story, manages to both eliminate and restores your faith in people and institutions."
Collective,99,93,audience,"As a romanian I think everybody from my country should watch this. For someone who is not romanian, if you want to know what corruption can make of people, what a communist regime can left behind, even after 30 years from there, here is a small glimpse of it."
Collective,99,93,audience,"Harrowing, unflinching and sobering documentation of corruption, morality and inhumane conduct by government official in the Romanian healthcare system."
Collective,99,93,audience,"The film documents the follow-up investigation of a very real and worrying tragedy that happened in Bucharest in late October 2015: a nightclub caught fire during a heavy metal concert and 27 people died. The film, though, is not about the tragedy, but about the aftermath, which shows us a corrupt and ineffective medical system, unable to help heal those who survived, instead attempting to cover everything up while praising its own made up competence. As a result, 37 others died in the hospitals and countless others have been scarred for life, both physically and emotionally.

Nanau does not once use talking heads, and rather prefers to let the mystery unravel by itself, painting a picture as grim as investigation films such as Serpico or The Conversation, but this time the corruption nightmare is real. By means of a few honest Romanian reporters, from a sports magazine nonetheless, we are slowly allowed to organically discover the naked flaws of a medical system not only incompetent, but unable to own up to its mistakes.

The victories in the investigation, big or small, are never interpreted by Nanau as victories, but merely as observations, cold facts because, at the end of the day, whether the reporters manage to reach their conclusions or not, there are no winners in stories such as this one."
Collective,99,93,audience,"I was speechless after watching this documentary. The journalists who uncovered the corruption as well as Vlad Voiculescu, the health minister who attempted to implement reforms, are all heroes."
Collective,99,93,audience,"Collective is limited in scope and themes, but it's an important look into the tragedy that happened in Romania during 2015 while particularly focusing on the aftermath of the incident and the journalists' quest to find justice. It showcases just how difficult it is to prevail in a system that is set against you from the ground up. Its dour tone is also fittingly heartbreaking."

Let Him Go,83,76,audience,"I was really enjoying it until the end. Did the end mean for us to understand that she, too, only wanted her grandson no matter how many people were killed even her husband?"
Let Him Go,83,76,audience,"Great cast and some intense moments, but it's just too predictable"
Let Him Go,83,76,audience,Absolutely horrible movie!!!! AND a waste of my money AND time!!
Let Him Go,83,76,audience,This had me on the edge of my seat. There were some really tense and original scenes. Glad I watched it and good to see Diane Lane getting these kinds of roles.
Let Him Go,83,76,audience,"Quietly devastating and mesmerizing at the same time, 'Let Him Go' will grab you and never let go.  Diane Lane may have never been better in this throwback western where things that happen matter.  It's really intense and the characters are deep and well drawn by Thomas Bezucha who wrote and directed.  Kevin Costner hasn't been this good in a long time.  There's a tension that builds as the movie changes tone.  While it's not perfect, I haven't cried this much or this hard in a long time.  Final Score: 8.8/10"
Let Him Go,83,76,audience,Without a doubt the worse depressing piece of garbage I have ever seen. After a year of being locked up and not allowed to go to movies due to Corvid. What kind of idiot made this piece of trash. A true piece of Hollywood garbage not fit to watch. Costner and Lane should be ashamed of them selves.
Let Him Go,83,76,audience,"The most depressing movie I've seen in a long time. Should have a trigger warning that you'll want to scream and throw the remote throughout the movie. Wish I would've known how exasperated and annoyed I'd be by the end, I wouldn't have watched it. Ruined my night."
Let Him Go,83,76,audience,Movie shared a great combination of storytelling and the right amount of drama I just couldn't turn away from.
Let Him Go,83,76,audience,"Unfortunately, due to the pandemic and a sleepy ad campaign this film will probably fall under most people's radars but it shouldn't. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner play Margaret and George Blackledge. Lane plays the outgoing, stubborn, and when need be, spitfire Mid-West wife while Costner plays the rough and rugged, reserved Gary Cooper-esque, strong and silent type. The film follows the couple who's former daughter-in-law and grandson move away from Montana to North Dakota to be with her new husband's family. Thankfully director Thomas Bezucha uses the beautiful and mountainous state's scenery to provide some eye candy during transitional scenes while the couple is traveling. They come upon trouble when they find where their former daughter-in-law and grandson are now calling home. The Weboy family is quite popular in the Dakota's and the real Queen B of the picture is played marvelously by Lesley Manville, who's the mother of the clan as Blanche Weboy. The scenes involving the Blackledge's and Weboy's are nothing short of tense. Upon arriving at the Weboy house, I was immediately reminded of the house from the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, and even though this is anything but a horror film, the build up, isolation, and sense of unease quickly develop. The film is well paced and doesn't overstay it's welcome. A very enjoyable ride that again, I hope is viewed by many as it's an all around solid flick!"
Let Him Go,83,76,audience,Really not great. Disjointed story line. Irrational decisions by everyone.

A Slow Burn
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
It's filled with humble machismo from Costner, impressive range from Diane Lane, and a bonkers role for Lesley Manville. There is more to it than meets the eye.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are superb in this shrewdly stealthy, suspenseful neo-Western.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
Let Him Go wears the mask of a revenge tale, but underneath is an intriguing tale about loss and grief.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
Let Him Go plays on Kevin Costner's western history while also letting women take the lead for once. Its unrelentingly sad story delivers the good when it needs to.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
This is a sensitive vigilante tale, and despite a fiery third act, you have to realize that it's a slower burn than the action movie promised by its trailer.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
Kevin Costner and Diane Lane do look great as a cowboy couple, our idealized rural mom and dad. Turns out Let Him Go is better as a catalogue than it is a movie.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
There is a bit of ""TV Movie"" to it, but that is also part of its charm. And I don't ever think I'll get tired of Kevin Costner grumbling along on the silver screen, occasionally beating someone up.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
An emotional and compelling piece that mostly overcomes its flaws.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
[A] tense yet soulful thriller set in the early 1960s.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
I'd have preferred to see ""Let Him Go"" as a Jack Reacher movie. It's the perfect setting for the 6'5"" ex-military cop to catch wind of Weboy family wrong-doing, eat all their porkchops, and then bare-handedly beat the ever-livin' heck out of all of them.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
In its totality, Let Him Go is many things: a crime thriller, a gothic western, a love story, and a family drama. Above all, it's a story about the various stages of grief and the difficulty of letting go.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
Let's face it, this is 100% the Diane Lane show.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
...it's Lane's presence that elevates this to something more than just a period Western drama...
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
Let Him Go has interesting elements, beautiful landscape photography and some well-rounded characters you can get behind -- and others you may enjoy hating -- but the story tangents and leisurely pacing blunt the effectiveness of the storytelling.
 "
Let Him Go,83,76,critic,"
There are few films of recent memory that give you permission to both fall in love with some of its characters and want the rest dead.

Freaky,83,80,audience,"We have seen the ""body-swap"" formula a handful of times already, but never as freaky as this. It's like Freaky Friday meets all your favorite teen slashers and horror classics. It might be a bit predictable, yes, but it never stops being fun. Smart, funny homage to horror, and comedy too. To be honest, I entered the screening room without any expectations and I was actually impressed by the bloody good time I had. Very entertaining, absurd, and surprisingly gory (which is weird being a Blumhouse production). A love letter to the genre, that puts Landon just a few steps behind masters like Carpenter and Craven. Can't wait to see it again. 

P.D. If you're not into horror, at least give it a go to see Vince Vaughn acting like a teenage girl. You can thank me later."
Freaky,83,80,audience,"so predictible and very weak script, performance were bored"
Freaky,83,80,audience,"Sorprende bastante, con mucha comedia de jóvenes increíble, con suspenso efectivo, el director sigue asombrado con su creatividad, contar una historia de asesinos slasher con muchas referencias y que puede ser uno de los grandes como Wes Craven o John Carpenter y con gore que esperaba ver."
Freaky,83,80,audience,"I enjoyed this! I really did. Nothing mind-blowing here. No revolutionary storytelling, just good at what it is-- a horror comedy with teens and an established, recognizable actor to give it profile, plus a decent production quality. It delivered that and only that. It's a few inches on the positive side of mediocre, and I'm cool with that."

Freaky,83,80,audience,OMG such a horrible movie. I can't regret enough to have spent money to rent this awful film. How can the rate be more than 80%!  Avoid.
Freaky,83,80,audience,"A horror take on the old FREAKY FRIDAY where Millie (played by Kathryn Newton) and the Blissfield Butcher (Vince Vaughn), swap bodies. They have only 24 hours to switch back or else the change will be permanent. I love Vince Vaughn and I still remember when he made good comedies. It wasn't all that long ago. Sadly, this is not one of them. The jokes are flat and juvenile that seemed like they were written for a PG-13 audience (which is a bit odd considering the film is rated R for violence and language). Besides that the film attempts to be too multilayered and woke. Not in a heavy handed sort of way, but more in terms of gaslighting (just enough to let you know that they're there). In addition the film is quite misandrynistic towards every white, male character with the exception of course of Millie's love interest. The only theme that does a decent job at preaching a positive message is at the end where *surprise* Millie finally finds her strength."
Freaky,83,80,audience,THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME 
Freaky,83,80,audience,"I wasn't sure what to expect going in. Everyone, except Vince Vaughn, was an unknown to me and he has been a hit or miss over the last 15 years. The previews showed nothing but a horror comedy so the cold open being an homage to Friday the 13th while taking itself seriously and emoting genuine emotion was a great introduction to the rest of the film which didn't stray from the comedy element like the intro. The female lead played her role well but Vince Vaughn completely stole the show acting as a teenage girl. Writing that sentence feels weird but the performance never gave off an inappropriate or creepy vibe. I found myself laughing hysterically for many of his scenes and the film sent you home with unforced character development and arc for Millie and her family. There are some stereotypical characters, at some points it was an obvious commentary on old horror films but other times came off as a genuine cliché instead of a satirized cliché. With that said it was never distracting and didn't ruin the experience in the slightest with Vince Vaughn stealing every scene he was in."

Blumhouse is known for its recipe for horror movie success, but this one just goes a little too far with showing us every gruesome attack leaving nothing to the imagination.

Excels at deconstructing the slasher genre while at the same time being a bona fide slasher movie.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
Freaky is fueled by witty, and sometimes meta, dialogue and in-your-face kills, but what makes this film an especially fun watch is the way Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton believably become each other's characters.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
Freaky makes for an entertaining, if familiar-feeling, weekend watch, with great performances from Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton. Predictable though it may be, the film ultimately succeeds in mixing horror, humor, and pathos in just the right measures.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
Freaky might not live up to its full potential, but there is enough here to satisfy those who like their comedy a little bloody.

Freaky,83,80,critic,"
It's obvious writer/director Christopher Landon is going for a fun horror movie vibe, but he lands on dumb instead of entertaining.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
Freaky knows it's a farce and winks at the silliest of slasher tropes, but that satirical edge doesn't keep it from being one of the most purely enjoyable horror works I've seen in a long time.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
Anchored by a pair of truly outstanding performances from Vaughn and Newton and embroidered with lovely emotional flourishes, Freaky is the real deal - a horror comedy with heart.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
You can feel the humor and the terror continually goosing each other here instead of canceling each other, even in the bits that don't quite work or feel like padding.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
After a strong start, and some engaging moments, it gets trapped trying to reinvent the movies that inspired it.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
Freaky absolutely has the best Vince Vaughn performance since 2000's Made, and it's amazing to see the effervescent joy he brings to this role.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
You will really really like it if you're not asking for much. But it's a one-note joke, and they do get enough out of it, but not enough for a whole song. The movie is not short, but it feels rushed...

Small touches would have made it great and pushed a little more, but I did have fun with it and there's enough laughs in here.

Freaky,83,80,critic,"
As we near the end of the year, it's hard to imagine how many more surprises 2020 has in store for us, but awards consideration for Vince Vaughn might still be on that list.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
Freaky isn't just the future of inclusive, social justice horror either. Freaky is the future of the horror genre altogether.
 "
Freaky,83,80,critic,"
It's entertaining enough, but ultimately feels like a hodgepodge of homages rather than its own beast.

Martin Eden,85,64,audience,"I have a feeling this is less profound of an adaptation than the filmmakers think, that said I do appreciate the performances and the ending."
Martin Eden,85,64,audience,"Aside from losing the girl from the beginning, it elegantly shows the struggles of a true marxist in the early 20th century. The film shoots its scenes like ""Bad Taste (1987)"" and ""Slumber Party Massacre 2 (1990)"". The head on shots show how divided he is between his friends opinions and his opinions, I think."
Martin Eden,85,64,audience,"My new favorite film of the year so far.  So much craft and depth.  Felt like coming up for air.

*Didn't hold up as well on second viewing.  Still good, but not the revelation I thought it was.  Either it caught me on a good day the first time around or on a bad day the second."
Martin Eden,85,64,audience,"This reminds me of the Modest Mouse song, Bukowski: ""God, who'd want to be such an a**hole?"" While the conventional bootstrap story of the first part is somewhat entertaining, the last part, long after success has been achieved, depicts so much boorishness and pretentiousness that I was ready for the film to end long before it actually did. There is zero subtlety here. The archival footage seemed tacked on. Gave it a half star for at least giving me interesting and attractive faces to look at for two hours."
Martin Eden,85,64,audience,"I did not read the book, and yet I feel that this italian work, found the way to export the essence  of it."
Martin Eden,85,64,audience,"Loosely based on author Jack London's 1909 novel of the same name, this Italian adaptation struggles to find its footing with an overly intellectualized narrative that attempts to fuse sociopolitical discussion with the merits of self-education and personal growth and development. Set in an indeterminate time in Italy's history (though the 1970s would be a good guess), the film follows the odyssey of an angry young working class man with minimal schooling who seeks to improve himself and rise above his social status by ravenously reading and pursuing a writing career after meeting a bourgeois love interest. It's a process that gradually turns him into an angrier young man when his vocational pursuits don't pan out, leading to personal dissatisfaction, unwitting political turmoil and the dissolution of his forbidden romance -- all of which ironically lead to his unexpected recognition as a gifted scribe, unexpected success and a new round of individual disillusionment. While the film is modestly interesting in the first half, it gradually starts to fall apart thereafter before completely losing it in the incoherent, overly dramatic final act. Don't let the lavish praise heaped on this offering fool you. This one is vastly overrated, to be sure."
Martin Eden,85,64,audience,"Beautiful, but somewhat jumbled adaptation of London's novella."

Martin Eden fluctuates between images shot... and archival materials, which spurs the film towards lyricism. [Full review in Spanish]

Martin Eden,85,64,critic,"
Portrait of the Writer as an Angry Young Man
 "
Martin Eden,85,64,critic,"
A would-be intimate epic that includes some striking images but overall is bewildering to the point of aggravation.
 "
Martin Eden,85,64,critic,"
Where Martin Eden occasionally goes fuzzy, Marinelli's performance gives the movie its backbone as it tells the story of a provocateur who loses his grip when society becomes used to him.
 "
Martin Eden,85,64,critic,"
Fitfully brilliant and almost equally exasperating.
 "
Martin Eden,85,64,critic,"
Pietro Marcello's Martin Eden is a tale of meteoric rises and spectacular falls, just not in the way most people imagine them.
 "
Martin Eden,85,64,critic,"
A sweep of cinematic history earned by the film's aspirations. No film could replicate the tragic weight of London's work, but this comes awfully close.

Time,98,49,audience,"It's the only thing we can't make more of. 

I could hear the arguments of both the detractors and supporters of Fox Rich as I watched this twenty year odyssey unfold in under eighty minutes, but while some will stick with their staunch opinions about having to do the time if you commit the crime Garrett Bradley's new doc, Time, will hopefully force such uncompromising views to step back and examine the root cause of what pushes an individual to feel as if they have nowhere left to turn while understanding the concept that not all time assigned is equal to the severity of the crime committed. And while there is much to be said about and learned from what Bradley's film chronicles none of it matters once the film reaches its sweepingly beautiful, but painfully tragic conclusion; it's maybe one of the most powerful and moving moments in any movie I'll see all year."
Time,98,49,audience,"Sibil ""Fox Rich"" Richardson is the striking subject of this impressionistic documentary from director Garrett Bradley. Mixing home movies and new footage, the film charts the 21 year-long journey of Fox to secure the release of her husband Robert from the Louisiana State Penitentiary, where he had been serving out an extraordinary sixty year sentence for armed robbery.

Unfortunately, the film does not make as good a case as it could for the injustice of Robert's sentence. He and Fox both did indeed rob a bank in a moment of desperation. Fox served several years in prison herself for the crime. But unexplained in the film is that this was Robert's first offence, nobody was physically harmed, the amount stolen was $5,000—and that a plea deal for 10 to 18 years was initially offered before a second attorney somehow managed to screw up the case so badly that this was increased to a life sentence. (The cost, by the way, of keeping someone in prison in Louisiana for 21 years is somewhere in the region of $350,000.)

Instead of these explanations we get a meditation on the way prison affects the lives of those left behind on the outside. Fox is left to raise their six children, including twins Justus and Freedom, by herself. By the time director Bradley catches up with the story, the twins are already grown up, one of them a dentistry graduate and the other a PoliSci major. Both of them look set to have impressive careers ahead of them. But Fox is the real star here: once out of prison, she became a fierce advocate for her husband and against the injustices of the prison system. She speaks with the fire and passion of a southern preacher to anyone who will listen.

By far the punishment that seemed to have had the most impact on her was the conversations she had with the people at the bank whose lives she and her husband's crime touched. But the depravations of prison life and the healing effects of restorative justice are barely explored here, Bradley preferring to watch Fox wait, and wait, and wait on the phone for some news about her husband's latest appeal. Depicting the depersonalised agony of this legal limbo is interesting to an extent, and it's clear that this is what Bradley set out to do. But I'm not sure that this film is really going to change anyone's minds about prison the way Fox and Robert may wish it to. The footage assembled by Bradley is so diffuse and unfocused that the end result feels almost abstract—and with a character as compelling as Fox at the film's centre, that feels like a bit of a missed opportunity."
Time,98,49,audience,"I cried, got mad, got sad and walked with them throughout their journey!
This ain't a must see. It's a MUST WITNESS"
Time,98,49,audience,"Garrett Bradley's first documentary feature, 'Time', is more than just about one individual, it's about the criminal justice system and how it's broken.  If you are blind or willfully ignorant and you give this 1 star or 1/2 star, odds are you didn't do more than read a summary about it or are a racist.  There's nothing wrong with this other than the camera work is a little shaky and even that's can be easily forgiven when you understand a lot of the footage wasn't meant to be in a movie.  Whenever I watch a film about the justice system and its disproportionate discipline to people of color I always recommend watching '13th'.  That is the gold standard for all docs in this genre.  A worthwhile film here for those who enjoy a great story.  Final Score: 7.7/10"
Time,98,49,audience,"This is such a moving film. It's gives a window into the lives of a family affected by longterm incarceration. The spirit and exceptionalism of this family overcomes and inspires.

I was saddened to see so little compassion in many of the reviews, and that many one star reviews were given based on a ""do the crime, do the time"" mentality, rather than on the merits of the film itself (it made me wonder if the reviewers actually watched the film). So I'll focus on the argument made by the bulk of the reviews. The subjects of this documentary never said that they shouldn't have been punished for their crime. There is true remorse shown and heartfelt apologies. No one denied the terrible choices that were made. The story shows the long-lasting effects of a purely punitive, rather than restorative, justice system. It gives a personal story and a deeper understanding to an often misunderstood subject in The United States. 

There is also the injustice of unreasonably long sentences given to Black people. Sentencing has been proven to be harsher for Black people than for White people (find the United States Sentancing Commission report on the US government's website).

There is a problem when a wealthy White man is sentenced to six months in prison for raping a woman because the judge was worried about the effect the conviction would have on his life, but a Black man with a family to support who acted out of financial desperation and didn't hurt anyone is given sixty years. Sixty years in prison is effectively a life sentence. According to the report, the police arrived at the scene of the robbery within a minute and no one was injured. 

If you take issue with the themes of this film, I would recommend the documentary ""13th"" by Ava DuVernay."
Time,98,49,audience,"A desperate and begging plea for empathy in a country that seems to have less and less every day. Chronicling the injustices and flabbergasting failures of a justice system that doesn't seem to earn the title of ""justice"" in any form. 

 If you do not feel for this couple, their struggle, their love, their redemption, and unrelenting fight, you really need to do some soul searching for your own sense of empathy. I wouldn't wish the pain that this couple went through on any of my worst enemies. This should be required viewing for every high schooler and older American so they can truly grasp the actions of this ""Justice System"" that is supposedly so 'fair and just'. 

This was the most moving documentary that I've ever seen and more. Please Watch."
Time,98,49,audience,"They committed a serious crime and deserved to go to jail. They weren't committing robbery because they were hungry, they wanted money quickly to open a boutique. It was a stupid choice, and I'm sure they regret it now, but it was a free choice."
Time,98,49,audience,"The couple who are the subjects of this documentary committed an armed robbery of a credit union because they wanted the money to start a hip hop themed clothing business. They were caught and sent to prison. The husband is the one who walked into the business with a gun and threatened to kill people, so he got a long sentence, his wife was the getaway driver so she only got a few years. The documentary maker presents them as victims, and treats their crime as though it's a trivial mistake. Armed robbery is an extremely serious crime and often ends in death, serious injury, and lifelong psychological trauma. This documentary ignores the victims and their suffering, and uncritically endorses Mrs Rich's belief that armed robbers like her husband should not be sent to prison."
Time,98,49,audience,"Sixty years is a very harsh sentence when many criminals are getting five for murder (which is baffling)? The wife was fortunate she got a lighter term.

I don't get the attitude, though. They seem confused over whose fault this was. It was their decision, wasn't it? How about the innocents who are traumatized, injured or even killed in robberies? Some of them never get over it; it ruins their lives."
Time,98,49,audience,"If you do the crime, be prepared to do the time. This couple made their choice, and of their own free will they robbed a bank. What did they expect would happen if they were caught? The woman is a prison abolitionist, and the documentary makers never ask serious questions about what the consequences would be if there were no prisons and people who committed serious crimes could continue to walk free and victimize more people."
Time,98,49,critic,"
Time is an achingly beautiful film of perseverance and hope in the shadow of the American carceral system.
 "
Time,98,49,critic,"
This is a beautifully shot film that's as interested in studying the changing faces of its subjects as laying out their struggle from end to end.
 "
Time,98,49,critic,"
By covering such a long period, the film emphasizes the ways in which an individual can change while staying committed to a single goal.
 "
Time,98,49,critic,"
Time reveals in its personal footage and profound storytelling a compelling story of one woman's fight against an unforgiving system. It's time well spent.
 "
Time,98,49,critic,"
An intimate exploration of time unjustly stolen by a justice system that never seems to deliver what it promises.
 "
Time,98,49,critic,"
A gripping documentary that reframes the perception of mass incarceration and its far-reaching effects.
 "
Time,98,49,critic,"
Time is a message film, but it's one where the smaller message trumps what's normally perceived as the bigger message. For Fox Rich, family is everything, and anyone who has a partner as determined and loyal as her should consider themselves lucky.
 "
Time,98,49,critic,"
Time is a gorgeous capturing of love and commitment, fighting for someone, and fighting against a system that fails to forgive.
 "
Time,98,49,critic,"
It allows us to see Fox and her family through their own eyes while giving the film the scope of an epic-one made up of fragments and focused, like all epics, on the promise of catharsis in a homecoming.
 "
Time,98,49,critic,"
Bradley's first documentary feature, Time, is an indictment against the prison-industrial complex in America, a motion for abolition in the wake of a system that has not lost its way in terms of serving justice but that never found it in the first place.
 "

[Director Garrett] Bradley's mastering of craft is evident in all the ways she strays from convention.

The film is predicated on deliberate, phony artiness... Nothing like liberal condescension to turn what might have been a sincere vow into 100 percent pure cliché.

Beautiful, patient and inspiring, Bradley's experiential doc captures how much life happens while you sit around waiting for justice and empathy.

The Glorias,67,65,audience,Excellent telling of the story of a woman and a movement that changed the world.
The Glorias,67,65,audience,"This is one of the best movies I saw for a while, a very relevant movie today.  It's great the director and movie put women's right, black right, native American, Asian American, gay rights all together, it's human's right! It's a much holistic way to look at things, and what's going on today in the world.  Julian Moore's speech at Catholic church is the most touching one, how in human history, men gradually alienate from nature, but make the church more isolated from nature and built hierarchy with white male God as the image, all the important female figures all became background. I believe in women's movement and the pro-choice. I can't believe it is still being discussed today.  Human has the choice for his/her life, as long he/her is responsible for the the choice he/she made, no one should tell him/her otherwise. That is basic human right! I can't believe the low rating the movie gets. It's the message it's carry that's way more important than the format itself. Do u all get the messages?"
The Glorias,67,65,audience,"This was not a movie, it was a pamphlet. (And I am a feminist and liberal and I actually stand behind everything that was in the film). Looked good, actors were great (although the accent Vikander did was weird) and the Wizard of Oz scene was great. I learned a lot about Steinem, so that's a good thing. But it was a badly edited cliff notes version of Steinhem's life with exposition instead of dialogue."
The Glorias,67,65,audience,"The Glorias has good intentions but is an overlong mess. The acting was great. Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander were both very solid. I like the idea of having Gloria Steinem being portrayed by four different actresses. The execution of it is hit and miss. I liked the scenes where the different Glorias interacted with each other. There are also some nice visual flourishes courtesy of director Julia Taymor. But the film doesn’t always know how to balance all 4 performances. The first hour or so goes back and forth and is a mess. The second half becomes more focused, but not enough to make me give this a positive review. The film is also nearly two and a half hours long. Many scenes drag and run on for two long. Overall, I get the ambition, but the execution was pretty lackluster. The film was a disappointing mess. Moore, Vikander, and Steinem deserve better. "
The Glorias,67,65,audience,Julie Taymor is a master storyteller and always finds a new way to tell her story with creative visual surprises. It was also a treat to see Bette Midler play Bella Abzug.
The Glorias,67,65,audience,"Good movie, very informative about the womens movement, shows many ethnicities join together united for equality. 🙋😃"
The Glorias,67,65,audience,Excellent portrayal of the emergence of a movement and a living legend
The Glorias,67,65,audience,"I thought it was well done if unconventional. The bus ride with all the different ages of Steinem talking to each other was unique. An unusual approach and at times confusing. I did find the actors did a very good job. Julianne Moore was just perfect as always, LOVE HER! I did not know much about Steinem and it was very informative. It held my attention all the way through. Good Movie! One bowl of popcorn..."
The Glorias,67,65,audience,Fantastic done in a slightly abstract way a great movie even if you are a fan of this great women

Difficult as biopics can be, The Glorias should have been glorious.

The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
The film's heart is in the right place, but The Glorias doesn't stand a chance with Taymor at the helm.
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
Steinem is one of the most influential women in the United States in the past 50 years, but The Glorias fails to show exactly why that is. Turning her portrayal over to four different actors is a great idea, but the film never finds its footing.
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
The Glorias isn't a standard biopic, but it also isn't as radical as its subject. It's an artfully arranged greatest hits package of a remarkable and influential life that dilutes its impact by trying to cover eighty of Steinem's years.
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
[Julianne Moore] ends up carrying the weight of the story. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
This is a movie conspicuously missing a clear through-line, and worse, any attempt to get inside Steinem's head to articulate as to why she sacrificed so much of her life in pursuit of one cause.
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
As the older Steinem, Julianne Moore is pitch perfect in recreating Steinem's speech, mannerisms, intellect and sly wit.
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
[Julie] Taymor's film doesn't proffer a biography of a real person; instead, this feels like the deified version, which shortchanges [Gloria] Steinem, her human story, and everyone she has inspired along the way.
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
The life story of one extraordinary woman - Gloria Steinem - in the hands of another extraordinary woman - director Julie Taymor - gives us the visually stunning and emotionally probing biopic ""The Glorias.""
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
A routine old-fashioned biopic on a feminist pioneer, that's informative but lacks heft.
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
These moments don't really work, but the idea behind them resonates. The movie feels like a conversation a dreaming Gloria Steinem might be having with herself, about herself.
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
As a reverent highlight reel and a history lesson, The Glorias gets the job done; as a movie, though, it rarely sings
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
Steinem's biography, ""My Life on the Road,"" has been turned into a time-hopping film that glows like a pop art daydream.
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
I appreciate everything Julie Taymor is trying to do by showing the whole face of the feminist movement -- even if it is a little bit standardly done.
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
A total meandering mess of a movie with killer talent and admirable intent...
 "
The Glorias,67,65,critic,"
An important and timely film for all Americans.

At times, the film is too choppy and needed more focus, but in the end, it's an insightful look at the influence Steinem had on so many people.

I'm Thinking of Ending Things,82,48,audience,"In this psychological thriller, Kaufman displays in a philosophical, theatrical, and uncomfortable way toxicity, time, what if's, loneliness, insecurities, dreams, passions, love, life itself. 

It's definitely a movie that deserves some rewatches in order to fully understand what it really tries to say and the whole references it makes. The kind of movie that I love and hate at the same time. It gave me some memorable, thoughtful moments, but I don't know if it was the editing or some of the monologues that gave me some wait, what? moments too that ""ruined"" the atmosphere for me. 

The first half was great. It's crazy how uncomfortable it gets (even relatable, at some point, and that's where the magic is). On this first watch, I felt it loses itself a bit during the middle with some matters that remained unsolved (?).

I loved the cinematography. I didn't even felt I was watching a straight-to-streaming film. Am I crazy to get excited by the fact that we'll get the chance to see it over and over? At least I know I will, alone, with friends, in the dark, at daylight. I bet it gets better on every watch.

Speaking of performances, Jessie Buckley does a great job. It's not even necessary to say Toni Collette does too because we already know she's amazing (psychotic characters are starting to be her forte, apparently), and actually, I kinda wanted to see her more. 

It was a good, uncomfortable, weird, and thoughtful first watch."
I'm Thinking of Ending Things,82,48,audience,"Nice try.  This film really tries to do something different and I appreciate that.  However, the movie doesn't go anywhere - there's no underlying point or message.  Being obtuse just for the sake of being obtuse is not art.  It's just dull and pretentious."
I'm Thinking of Ending Things,82,48,audience,"I'll be honest, I didn't fully have a clue what was happening for large portions. Yet, I still weirdly enjoyed watching 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things'.

I think the main reasons for that are the two leads: Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons. They kept everything feeling fresh and intriguing to me, both have their moments in this. Toni Collette and David Thewlis also do very well. I like the cast, for sure.

As for the plot, it didn't do anything for me but it did keep me thinking which I appreciated. I, personally, would've preferred a shorter run time and clearer meaning - the latter is just me though, I'm sure others will adore the way the film is portrayed.

Some other reviewers have put it perfectly in terms of matching me: not nous enough to 'get it', but it still comes across as a good film. I'm fine with that, each to their own as always."
I'm Thinking of Ending Things,82,48,audience,"My friend recommended this to me and about 20 mins in I texted him ""I'm thinking of ending my watch of this movie.""  Unfortunately, I didn't and sat through a boring and pointless hour and a half.  We're not friends anymore."

The Devil All the Time,64,79,audience,"The whole preachifying atmosphere just makes the devil feel closer and present everywhere, in every one of the characters.

This is the first film I watch by Antonio Campos, and although it does bring up some provocative, violent, and unsettling moments, a (memorable?) good performance from Pattinson and a decent one from Holland (that, to be honest, I just watched Spider-Man killing in cold blood a bunch of lunatics; I can't seem to take him seriously with his little kid's voice and gestures), in the end, it falls flat.

There's no real (nor interesting) introduction to the characters, the timeline is all over the place, all women we're so disposable and mistreated by all the men they preach to admire, and that evil and depraved Bonnie and Clyde-like couple, what the hell...

*I haven't seen Pattinson going this nasty, mean and vile before in a movie. I will consider ½ star more, just for his uncomfortable and delusional SUPPORTING role."
The Devil All the Time,64,79,audience,"Fascinating! It's written a little like a puzzle so, in order to understand all those connections, you have to see it at least a couple of times."

The Devil All the Time,64,79,audience,"This film transmits something to me that few do, and that is to feel an excess of empathy towards the characters, I really liked the way the story was going to its outcome, putting us many problems that all ended up the same way. Tom Holland has shown with this film that not only is he to be Spiderman, but also has great potential in his future."
The Devil All the Time,64,79,audience,"It is dark, twisted, and bleak, yet absolutely fascinating. It can make its audience question themselves, their beliefs, and if this world is random, or if there is divine intervention. It is definitely worth watching, if for the performances alone.

The Devil All the Time,64,79,audience,"It's not surprising that Harry Melling, the Harry Potter actor who tortured the titular boy who lived as his evil step-brother Dudley, gives an unsettling performance in The Devil all the Time, but it may be surprising how good the actor is in this genuinely alarming role. His turn as traveling salesman for the Lord, Roy Laferty, takes Director Antonio Campos' adaptation of Donald Ray Pollock's 2011 novel of the same name into the seeming direction Campos has decided he most wants to tackle from the novel which obviously has a lot going on in regards to both character and theme. It would be laughable to attempt to condense the events depicted in The Devil all the Time down into a sentence or two, but what's worth surmising from all the simmering done on screen is that Campos mostly wants to focus on the hypocrisy of people and specifically, in small town West Virginia during the middle of the last century, the hypocrisy largely embodied by Christianity. Enter Laferty, a man of such conviction he'll pour spiders on his face to prove God has allowed him to overcome his fear of arachnids (but didn't bother preventing one from biting him) in an exercise that isn't necessarily blind conviction, but it is the type of dogma that allows ignorance to prevail; that allows principles to take the place of reasoning. 

In zeroing in on this theme, Campos' film becomes a sometimes tireless set of sequences that emphasize time and again how we as a human race too often put our faith in those as flawed as ourselves, foolishly hoping those called by our creator might actually prove to be the best of us. We watch as character after character, from Mia Wasikowska's Helen to Bill Skarsgard's Willard to Eliza Scanlen's Lenora look to those at the head of their church for some type of direction, but despite being vigilant somehow end up astray. Helen, Lenora, and even Willard tend to be searching for some sign of hope in a world largely considered lost and in turning to those they believe best suited to fight the darkness instead find the worst perpetrators of it. It is this character trait of searching, that many of the characters still have a drive to seek what might be good and right in the world that balances the rampant corruption and violence depicted in the film. That said, The Devil all the Time is rightfully unforgiving in its portrayals of said violence, prejudice, and Christianity as Campos' film essentially boils down to a deposition against organized religion and how it's ultimately as perverse as the perversions it purports to detest. 

So yeah, I kind of loved it."

No one would want to live in a world like the one portrayed in The Devil All The Time, and even watching it for a couple of hours is a hard sell. Movies about bad people can work, but they need much more depth than the filmmakers delivered here.

Antebellum,28,53,audience,"I applauded the trailer for this film as it doesn't give away too much of the movie (nowadays I feel like I've seen 75% of movies in their 2-minute trailers). So there was a bit of unknown heading in to this. From what I saw, it seemed like an interesting concept and piqued my curiosity. In doing so, for the better part of the movie you're glued to the story, trying to decipher the time period exactly and it was quite entertaining. I applaud the writers and directors (both Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz), on their originality in developing this story. Once the time period is revealed, however, the film becomes too preachy. Save the performances of leading star Janelle Monae and villain Jena Malone, the film is WAY too heavy handed with it's virtue signaling. The third act is nothing more than an anti-white, I mean anti-right, propaganda piece. I'm surprised more critics are lauding this more as a ""timely"" film. My biggest grip with the film however, was with Gabourey Sidibe, who plays Dawn and is the best friend of Monae's character of Veronica. I'm sure some will find her performance strong and empowering. Whereas I found her to be nothing more than rude and ill-mannered, displaying her toxic femininity."
Antebellum,28,53,audience,"Quantum Leap this is not. But as much as the first 40 minutes of the film would have anyone believe, this isn't Roots either.
 Antebellum is a film about the dangers of indoctrination and just why Civil War renactments should join the long list of activities attacked by cancel culture.
 This is an ugly look as to why a person like myself can't even bear to want to live in an apartement complex called ""The Plantation"" in Mississippi, while I am looking for a new place to spread my wings.
 This film also shows that yoga classes do come in handy, the girl who played Precious will never be my type (in attraction or in comedy), and if I had the chance to kidnap and enslave Janelle Monae - I would do it in a heartbeat as well, but not for ethnic reasons.
 There are some gaping plotholes in the film, such as why there wasn't an uprising any sooner , but I guess learned helplessness and cowardice are more than psychology terms.
 This is movie does more than any twerking at D.C. ever could.
 Even with half of the movie looking like Roots (and I hate slave movies due to the indoctrinal aspect of showing people who share my ethnicity in such a dismal state) , this movie gets a pass. 
 Definietly misbranded as a horror film, ""Antebellum"" is as much psychological thriller as the film is history lesson and revolutionary protest.
 So what if the slow motion was too much at the end or the jokes were garbage and geared to neglect the male audience? I just know I was close to turning off this film halfway through thinking this was another ""Birth of a Nation"" and instead I was left with something special that caught me by surprise.
 Monae is oozes sexiness as a damsel in distress , when the villains get their comeuppance it feels incomplete yet still satisfying, and by the end of it all I never felt happier that I moved out of Louisiana , except maybe when I heard about the ""gorilla glue girl"" who is about 40. A disturbing and unnerving picture , but what film about the institutions the U.S. thrives off of shouldn't be? Antebellum sure kept my antennaes raised during and after the film went off , and that is the true ""horror"" element of this thriller - when the truth is more uglier than fiction."
Antebellum,28,53,audience,"Advertised as a horror movies, but in actuality it is a psychological thriller. A very thought provoking one at that, as a black person really makes you think. There is lots of gruesome slavery brutality that I don't know is necessary, I did watch it again and think it's a crazy premise for a movie."
Antebellum,28,53,audience,Lovvedd it. Beautiful acting. Loved the plot twist. Got me feeling emotional and hoping for the slaves to escape and the white people to get what's coming for them. I just wish they extended the ending a bit more.
Antebellum,28,53,audience,Good acting.  Good suspense.  Kept me engaged throughout.  I liked it. Not sure why it has low ratings. About 10 times better than Nomadland.
Antebellum,28,53,audience,"Woke is the new genre of movies from Hollywood and they are simply awful.  Its now about the message not the story  In Antebellum, White people are portrayed as catoonishly racist, Wealthy Black people with a Doctorate and a published book are somehow oppressed,  and Gabourey Sidibe's character (Dawn) is so maliciously rude and arrogant, you cringe every time she appears on screen. I wanted to see Karma got to work and have Dawn hit and killed by a truck.  Movies are supposed to suspend your disbelief and the ending of this movie is so bad your disbelief is resumed nearly immediately before the credits roll.  Not how ANY movie should end."
Antebellum,28,53,audience,"During the excruciatingly cruel first act, Janelle Monáe is trapped as a slave on a Southern plantation. Suddenly, she's back in the present, where she's a noted author writing about racism. This strange parallel world develops into a somewhat interesting thriller. It takes time before it becomes genuinely tense, but Monet makes it worth watching  and Gabourey Sibide also adds some fun support. Throughout, the cinematography is beautiful, which makes even the most horrible scenes more palatable. First-time writing/directing duo Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz are obviously fans of Get Out with their variation on racial horror. Even though they didn't succeed like Jordan Peele, their dark vision is still compelling."
Antebellum,28,53,audience,It was a great movie until the very end. The ending fell flat for me. The ending was not great and unfortunately ruined the movie for me.
Antebellum,28,53,audience,"Antebellum was a powerful, disturbing, thought provoking thriller. You are left feeling shocked in a brutal way. This was a thriller that had so many important things to say about the undercurrent of race relations today. From microaggressions to a culture of looking the other way from racists and the pain of people of color, watching as a white person it hurts in the ways I think it is intended to. Disappointed the critic reviews were not better, wonder what movie they were watching if they didn't get the point? Feels like...plays into the point of the whole dang movie. Highly recommend."
Antebellum,28,53,audience,"This movie is so much better than people here are giving it credit for. It is a social commentary on race in the U.S. along the lines of Get Out, although while Get Out explored the underlying racism even in a seemingly ""liberal"" family, Antebellum takes on the Confederate South and the Civil War. The beginning is a depiction of slavery that is difficult to watch but if you stick with it there is a very interesting twist. This film takes the typical, soul-crushing story of slavery and flips it on its head, and I thought the ending was satisfying."
Antebellum,28,53,critic,"
Maybe this is asking too much, but you wish Antebellum had a bit more to say about the current state of America.
 "
Antebellum,28,53,critic,"
Taken as a thriller alone, Antebellum can be enjoyed on a surface level. But its message is intertwined with the story as a whole, and in that respect, it doesn't live up to its potential.
 "

Antebellum fails on the writing and directing levels before any of its cast has a real chance to salvage it. Live by a hooky concept, die by a hooky concept.
 "
Antebellum,28,53,critic,"
A horror film that doesn't rely on jump scares. Instead it blends social commentary on the legacy of American slavery with the supernatural to form a provocative essay on how the unresolved past can create turmoil in the present.
 "
Antebellum,28,53,critic,"
[The film] prioritizes its message over its story and characters. And really, the message is moot without the others to deliver it.
 "

Antebellum sprinkles its under-considered plot with elements that recur but are never explained... Meanwhile, the more difficult questions behind Antebellum's world-building choices go unaddressed.
 "
Antebellum,28,53,critic,"
Antebellum ends up feeling like the Green Book of horror movies, and in a year that brought racial inequality to the forefront, that makes it feel extra insulting.
 "
Antebellum,28,53,critic,"
Antebellum succeeds mainly at looking pretty good, wasting its uber-talented cast (Monáe is solid as she firefights through), and, well, that's about it really
 "
Antebellum,28,53,critic,"
Expertly shot and directed but from a narrative standpoint it's misguided at best and downright offensive at worst.
 "

The Milk of Sorrow,78,68,audience,"The Milk Of Sorrow is a wonderful film that might not be for everyone. It's slow and very hands off in its direction. The proceedings transpire with a non sympathetic approach. I felt bad for the protagonist in a real world sense in that i understood where she was coming from, but without all the usual hollywood cues hollywood uses to munipulate emotion from the audience. The underlining allegory of the film is about dealing with old wounds and a destructive past; and how sometimes it may be easier to cling to pain than to move past it. I can relate to that and i can see how it can be difficult to let go of something that has soo deeply scarred you and you people that its essentially changed your DNA. It's beautifully shot, with a wonderful but simplistic sound track. Highly recommended viewing ***** Five out of Five stars."

All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,73,audience,brilliant! an absolute must see.
All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,73,audience,An essential rallying cry for this moment in history.
All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,73,audience,All Americans need to watch this film.
All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,73,audience,"A very important film that's well worth seeing for anyone interested in American politics. It's really so depressing to see how effective voter suppression is over there. The confederates may have lost their right to keep slaves, but they and their political descendants have clearly done everything they can to stop black people and other ethnic minorities from voting."
All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,73,audience,"It is an eye opener on how real is voter suppression in America. It is a call to action to people to vote and to politicians to protect and respect the will of the voters.  I only gave it 4 stars because it did not open the mic to the other side.  It is only fair to have both sides express their points on the issue.  Unless, of course, the other side refused to participate on the documentary, but the producer did not make it clear they asked them.  Other than that, it makes to point of showing the audience of the problem."
All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,73,audience,"When did the world become as ridiculous as a 80s weekly cop drama?  This documentary is constructed in a way that is frustrating.  There's a lot to sort through including the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights era, and the deconstruction of the Voting Rights act.  The through line is the 2019 Georgia Gubernatorial race between Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams.  That common denominator is muddled by the way the story is laid out.  Whenever I see films like this, I say if you don't get it see 13th.  If you still don't get it then you are willfully NOT getting it.  This happens to be rushed and not as good as most in the field, but it's not boring and it's not wrong.  If that's a problem for you then your issue may be in the mirror.  Final Score:  6.5/10"
All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,73,audience,"With All In: The Fight For Democracy, documentarians Liz Garbus and Lisa Cortes weave a compelling account of the history of voting rights in the U.S, a long, winding path through many of the most pivotal moments and movements of the past--through triumph and tragedy--bound to infuriate audiences just as much as it'll invigorate them. 

The story of voting rights in this country is not brief, nor simple. The movie opens with a primer on Georgia's 2018 gubernatorial election between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp. From there, the film documents the vast journey from the dawn of our nation when the only people who could vote were white, male landowners to where we are today, with voting rights for all citizens over 18.

It's remarkable just how much Garbus and Cortes are able to encompass within the film from Reconstruction and Jim Crow segregationist practices, and the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century, up to the present day. The pacing is impressive and gives the viewer a lot to take in and take away from the film, but the film is never overwhelming in its scope or ambition. Garbus and Cortes even include footage as recent as the Wisconsin primary depicting voters donning facemasks at the polls. It's slightly surreal to see a story being told that is so heavily informed by the headlines of today. The film's most engaging perspective comes not from that of a voter, but a politician in that of Stacey Abrams. Her point of view anchors the film as living proof of the consequences of voter suppression. The importance of voting demonstrated throughout gives urgency to All In, and I commend the editing, considering how much the situation surrounding voter suppression and the fight for voting rights was still developing in the months leading up to the film's release.

All In: The Fight For Democracy affirms the power of one's vote and shows how much traction has been gained in establishing wider voting rights. The film also demonstrates the degree to which the ever-present threat of voter suppression has grown and the ways in which it plagues the elections of today, illustrated by the gubernatorial race between Abrams and Kemp. Michael Waldman utters a sentence early on in the film that encapsulates nicely the film's thesis: ""History is never a straight line, it's always a fight."" History repeats itself just as often as it progresses and that notion is crystallized within this film at various points where the film jumps back in time to show how the past has informed the present. All In closes with a crystal-clear message to go vote. An acute reminder that All In can't close the door on its story precisely because the fight referred to in the film's title is still ongoing. Much work has been done in the realm of voting rights, but much more still remains to be done— the film doesn't lose sight of that. 

I give All In: The Fight For Democracy 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 for some brief violent images from newsreels and archives. This is timely, illuminating documentary filmmaking covering a pressing issue and definitely a must-see, not just for the information it contains, but the skill with which it's presented. All In: The Fight For Democracy is available to Amazon Prime subscribers starting September 18, 2020.

The story started with Adult David in a theatre telling the people how his life was. We get to see how his life was, beginning at when his mother gave birth to him. After his birth, David had a happy life until his mother decided to marry Edward Murdstone, which David wasn't so happy to hear about it. He got beaten by Edward and he decided to send David to the Pegotty's family, far away from his home. He worked at a fabric until he ran away from there a few years later after hearing that his mother died. He found his aunt, Betsey Trotwood, and stayed with her and her husband mr. Dick. His aunt decided to send him to a gentleman's school where he met the girl he likes, Dora Spenlow. But after another drama he decided to marry Agnes Wickfield.

My honest opinion, it was actually the least interesting movie I've ever seen. The story was interesting, but the thing is, there were a lot of plot holes than a story. Like, how did the mother die? Where was Dora? What happened to the workers at David's old hous? After reading the wikipedia, a lot of things where clearer. Also, comedy was a part of the genre, which I don't think would fit in. Yes, there were here and there jokes, but I never laughed at any of them. They were just there, showing that there were jokes, and also little hard to understand some of the jokes they made.

There was drama, like when David got send away to another family and that he needed to work at a young age. When he found out his mother was dead, the emotions the actor gave to the audience was great. You could really see and feel the anger that he had. Or when Uriah Heep became a villain in the story for a short time. The actor also showed happiness, when he was kiting with his uncle.

I loved the story, to show that not every person who is rich actually had a great past. I think the director did a great job. How the story was built, how it was played, everything. The actors were also great. Only, if they did a better job to cover up the plot holes they made, the movie wouls have been even better."
The Personal History of David Copperfield,92,53,audience,"I adore the English classics and Dickins is a particular favourite. I watched this film as I've seen every film and TV incarnation of David Copperfield and just had to see this one. I was concerned with the ‘diverse' cast in a historic classic, but hoped it would add a new artistic nuance to this much loved story. Thankfully the ethnicity of the cast wasn't an issue, in fact it became one of the few positive points of this film. I'm sorry to say the film is a total mess, only very loosely based on the novel. I found myself wondering If I'd taken some hallucinate drug before watching the film. Visually the film is vibrant and stunning, however, it made absolutely no sense whatsoever. I honestly think the only faithful adherence to the novel were the characters names! I also wondered if the editor had become confused and spliced the film together in the wrong order. I would recommend this film only to those who haven't read the novel or seen any of the other film adaptations, and like to do complex jigsaw puzzles. They would probably enjoy trying to piece together this jumbled mess of scenes to find a storyline (if there is one to be found)"
The Personal History of David Copperfield,92,53,audience,"Fun energy and touches, but ultimately seemed somewhat under-inspired.  The best thing about it, being (what I hope is) its underhanded ridicule of endemic contemporary tokenism."
The Personal History of David Copperfield,92,53,audience,"Sadly, critics can no longer give helpful reviews when the diversity of the cast is more important than the story itself. The audience score is far more accurate if not a bit too generous. The characters are embarrassingly cartoonish and the story is a disjointed mess that bares little resemblance to this classic tale. Avoid at all costs."
The Personal History of David Copperfield,92,53,audience,"Usually when there's a big disparity between critic and user reviews, the user rating is higher. It's the other way around here, which judging from the reviews seems to mainly be due to its ethnically diverse cast. One wonders what they expected, if they saw the preview before watching it. I personally found it refreshing to just have all kinds of people in the cast without regard to appearance. I could see this being odd for a non-fiction film (unless done for a specific reason like Hamilton), but this is a work of fiction to begin with, so it shouldn't matter.

Of course any book adaptation's most important question is, how well does it succeed with the translation of book to screen? In this case, I think it does as well as can be expected in just two hours, and better than I thought it would in that timeframe. It was actually my 12 year old who really wanted to watch it, and we both found it very enjoyable and engaging, though I had to pause a couple of times to explain certain things.

The novel realistically portrays both the ups and downs that occur in any human life, like waves on the sea. The four hour BBC miniseries focused on the negative events, which gave the impression that the book is one big depressing slog. I thought it was because there's no good way to fully capture the novel in anything less than an about 8 hours, though now that I've seen this new movie, I get the feeling that the 4-hour version could have managed to be more balanced. I think the movie does exaggerate the quirks of the characters, but the humor and quirkiness are a big part of what creates the needed balance between light and dark.

As for the actual events of the book, the movie combined a few different parts of the story together to condense it. Most of the time this works pretty well, and there's no getting around it given the timeframe. My only issue with it is near the end. In the book, Copperfield has experienced some tragedies that are so overwhelming to him that he goes abroad for a while to work it all out. This time abroad is an extremely heart-rending experience for him and the best part of the book, when he looks back over his life, sorts through his emotions, and determines his way forward. In the movie, there is neither the tragedy nor the time abroad. Instead, he simply starts compiling all of the notes he took over the years of the characters and events that have shaped his life. But he is not in a state of anguish as he does this, only focused creativity. And while it does give him some personal revelation, this is covered in an extremely cursory way and given probably about 30 seconds of screen time. So while the rest of the movie feels well-paced, the end feels rushed and less emotionally engaging than it could have been."
The Personal History of David Copperfield,92,53,audience,"Putting a fresh face on a classic is always a risky proposition, especially with a mob of purists on the sidelines ready to pounce on even the slightest transgression. However, director Armando Iannucci's latest effort takes a valiant stab at doing that with Charles Dickens's semi-autobiographical novel and mostly comes up a success. Note, though, that I said mostly. While the narrative deviates somewhat from its source material and condenses the overall story from its original voluminous length, this largely lighthearted take on the novel is whimsically entertaining, even if that whimsy sometimes goes over the top and becomes annoying as a result of its own self-congratulatory cleverness. Viewer engagement with the characters could have been bolstered as well, though this is compensated for by the excellent ensemble cast, particularly the fine performances of Dev Patel (his best work), Tilda Swinton, Hugh Laurie, Peter Capaldi and Ben Whishaw. The multiracial cast might strike some audience members as a bit odd at first given the story's Victorian English setting (think ""Hamilton"" meets Dickens), but that ""distraction"" tends to dissipate as the film moves along, especially since the film itself tends to get stronger the further it moves along. While this reworking of a classic may not succeed on every front, it's certainly novel enough to provide a lazy afternoon's entertainment and a nice escape from the everyday world."
The Personal History of David Copperfield,92,53,audience,"It's Wes Andersonesque, offbeat, weird, whacky and zany, and I really enjoyed it! Totally not what I expected it to be, and I'm glad. I've not seen any of Armando Iannucci's work before, but I shall be adding them to my Hit List right now!"
The Personal History of David Copperfield,92,53,audience,Saw it twice. Great acting and movie. Too many negative reviewers can't get over a brown man in a leading role.
The Personal History of David Copperfield,92,53,audience,A Whacky and surprising turn from Writer/ Director Armando Ianucci. TPHODC has the spirit of Dickens lively throughout.
The Personal History of David Copperfield,92,53,audience,"Hay comedias que llegan hasta un punto tan estúpido, que llegan a volverse cansonas a pesar de tener mucha comedia y trágicamente David Copperfield cae en esta categoría, además el personaje discriminado reprendido y abusado por la sociedad, termina siendo el malo, o sea ¿porque?, aunque si debo de decir que el clímax es lo que deja a la película con un propósito, además de que Dev Patel si le da una buena interpretación a este personaje y también esta muy bien los diseños de vestuarios y diseño de producción"

To borrow a couple of Dickensian phrases, it's a whizbang adaptation with a sassigassity to it.
 "
The Personal History of David Copperfield,92,53,critic,"
The Personal History of David Copperfield has to be one of the most unexpected creative pivots in recent memory. Not since Guy Ritchie decided to make a Disney musical has a filmmaker deviated so drastically from what is expected of them.
 "

Scrappy and stylized, it's a memorial celebration of loss and love - since 2020 marks the 150th year since the death of Charles Dickens.

This disappointment relies on far too many gimmicks in an effort to put a distinctive turn on Dickens' classic novel and falls flat at every turn.

Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,audience,"It's beyond apparent the admiration Werner Herzog had for his friend and subject in his latest documentary, Bruce Chatwin.  Herzog does his standard narration and he will once again polarize audiences who will inevitably dispute the value of his work.  Beauty is, after all, in the eye of the beholder.  Truth is we all should be lucky enough to be eulogized by Werner Herzog.  When the film wraps up and the pieces of it go through your mind you get a picture into the genius of our fabled filmmaker.  While this wasn't his best, it's still worth viewing especially if you're a fan!  Final Score: 6.5/10"
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,audience,"Good god this is an awful movie about nobody. Even worse, the soundtrack. Horrible music."
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,audience,Boring! I should have left halfway through the movie but I kept thinking it would get better. I can’t believe this movie was actually released for the theatre. It is something that is better seen at home on the Smithsonian channel or something similar. I thought the movie would have beautiful cinematography but that was far too rare of an occurrence. Don’t waste your money seeing this one! The worst movie I’ve seen in a long time!
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
Though the director employs considerable archival material, its footage of his own journeys - set to Ernst Reijseger's eclectic score - that really gets to the heart of Chatwin
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
One of the kindest things Herzog has ever made, even if it doesn't have the intellectual stamina to make it into the top tier of his filmography.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
[Werner Herzog] latest does not hit me with the usual intensity of his documentaries but it is still an interesting look into the full and varied life of his friend.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
This film holds up a mirror to Chapman's adventures and throws light upon his own in the process; and it's in that dance of light upon the screen that the magic happens.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
: In following some of the strands of Chatwin's life, we actually learn just as much about Herzog.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
Chatwin summoned Herzog, offering him the gift of the fine, brown leather rucksack that had accompanied him on all of his travels. (Another sturdy good that Chatwin's name is attached to is the Moleskine notebook, of which he filled scads.)
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
In seeing the world through Chatwin's eyes, Herzog has made one of his most unexpectedly personal films.
 "

If you can make it all the way to the end of the film, there's a sweet homage... But I did find it a bit tedious.

I had never heard of the British writer Bruce Chatwin before watching Werner Herzog's documentary - and now, I'm kind of obsessed with him, though not nearly as obsessed as Herzog is.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
Throughout this free-flowing documentary ... Herzog's admiration, respect, and love for his subject is always present.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
""Nomad"" has several indelible moments: seeing the backpack and annotated script, Herzog's account of visiting Chatwin just before his death. But overall the film is static and more wayward than not.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
This isn't the carefully curated version of Herzog, the affable old German quietly voicing wonder about the universe, or detached resignation for the fate of humanity. This is Herzog, looking back at a kindred spirit that he lost along the way.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
It's all stunningly visualized with sweeping drone footage, offering sumptuous perspectives on far-flung worlds that seem even further away as we're all homebound these days.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
Herzog has made a lumpy and rambling visual companion piece to Chatwin's books, veering from airy mystical talk to biographical snippets to Herzog's personal reminiscences about his friendship with Chatwin.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
As the movie's reach extends, Herzog limns an arc that stretches from Antarctica to Siberia and beyond, implying that, in a sense, we all came from the same unfixed place.
 "
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin,92,50,critic,"
Even if [Herzog] one day set out to make an overt cinematic self-portrait of his life and work, it is hard to believe that it could be as penetrating and insightful as this film.

It is a deplorable work, which ... espouses nauseating pro-military and patriotic sentiments.

Desert One has no real point of view. It doesn't offer much, beyond honoring the men who tried to rescue the hostages, and is by default but not by conviction militaristic.

It felt a little bit dry to me. Having a lot of perspectives is good, but it means that you have a long series of talking heads... That said, it was worth watching.

""Desert One"" is a comprehensive and informative documentary.

The movie is riveting because there is a legitimately great director behind the camera. Putting the pieces of the historical puzzle together is documentarian Barbara Kopple, who's a living legend in the field.
 "

Even if you're already keen to the mission's numerous SNAFUs, it's infinitely more compelling to hear it told by the men who were there, as well as a handful of the 53 hostages the special-ops team sought to extract.
 "
Desert One,88,100,critic,"
By giving the servicemen, world leaders and ordinary witnesses from both sides of the crisis the chance to tell their story, Kopple has taken what was becoming a forgotten chapter in history and turned it into compelling cinema.
 "
Desert One,88,100,critic,"
Kopple's approach is so thorough that the film often takes the breath away. The range of interviewees alone makes it worth a look, as they recount personal anecdotes and perceptions.
 "
Desert One,88,100,critic,"
Kopple finds a way to make Desert One a rousing film that ultimately works as a symbol for American imperialism. It makes patriotism out of the rubble of abject failure.
 "
Desert One,88,100,critic,"
The most powerful and moving section of the film is the telling of the how the operation itself went from bad to worse...

Desert One,88,100,critic,"
It's a masterly piece of cinema that courageously takes on a rarely-addressed theme: failure.

Song Without a Name,95,,audience,"Absolutely beautiful cinematography and an engaging, heartbreaking story."
Song Without a Name,95,,audience,"A striking, powerful and skillful directorial debut from Melina León, that with excellent performances, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, claustrophobic and haunting atmosphere, melancholic soundtrack and an emotionally affecting narrative, it serves as a sad, thought-provoking, heartbreaking, disturbing, evocative and gritty exploration of one of the darkest chapters in Peruvian history."
Song Without a Name,95,,audience,"This fact-based but atmospheric tale of the efforts of a young mother and a closeted journalist to uncover an infant selling ring in Peru during the country's political turmoil of the 1980s provides a unique take on a shocking news story told from a highly personal, exceedingly inventive perspective. With an excellent lead performance by Pamela Mendoza, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography and an ethereal original score, director Melina Leon's debut feature tells a captivating story all its own while simultaneously paying homage to Latin American political thrillers (most notably Chilean-based offerings like ""Missing"" and ""Spider""), as well as tales of minority disenfranchisement and exploitation (such as Mexico's ""Roma""). Admittedly, the film could use a little more back story for context, and it sometimes tries to do a little too much, with some story threads not fleshed out as thoroughly as they could be. Overall, though, this is a fine initial offering from another promising new talent, a filmmaker who clearly demonstrates a great deal of vision and imagination in telling a story that could have easily been presented much more conventionally in lesser skilled hands."
Song Without a Name,95,,audience,"The black and white camera work captures the story in a powerful way, depicting the time and place with incredible artistry."

Their worlds are caught in silvers and blacks by Inti Briones, constrained by the box-like restrictions of academy format filmstock - a deliberate claustrophobia similar to what Robert Eggers achieved by using Movietone ratio in The Lighthouse.

Train to Busan,94,89,critic,"
There is much to enjoy here, but is there ever really any justification for a two-hour long zombie movie? Train To Busan argues not.
 "
Train to Busan,94,89,critic,"
Yeon Sang-ho directs a film, which definitely moves towards being a blockbuster, but manages to induce it with a number of elements that make it much more meaningful than the majority of zombie and action films
 "
Train to Busan,94,89,critic,"
The amount of energy that director Yeon Sang-ho is able to infuse into Train to Busan is a welcome change from the stop and go nature of recent entries in the genre.
 "
Train to Busan,94,89,critic,"
No matter what angle you're looking at this from, we've seen it before.
 "
Train to Busan,94,89,critic,"
Seok-woo comes to realize that selfish short-sighted attention is inherently inhuman. Metaphorically, it's what separates us from the zombies.
 "
Train to Busan,94,89,critic,"
An entertaining and well crafted zombie-disaster film.
 "
Train to Busan,94,89,critic,"
With a combination of incredible casting, rapid pacing and great scripting, Train To Busan is the best South Korean zombie film you'll ever see.
 "
Train to Busan,94,89,critic,"
[It's] nothing we haven't seen before but Train to Busan takes a unique and surprisingly intimate spin on the high-octane zombie genre.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,audience,"Zombie for Sale is a lighthearted and cheeky addition to the zombie genre. It walks a fine line between Shaun of the Dead and Warm Bodies. Lee Min-jae's directorial debut isn't groundbreaking but it stands apart from the regular zom-com. If you're anticipating something with more horror elements, you could be disappointed, but with its array of comical characters and a new take on the genre, Zombie for Sale is a creative addition to the sub-genre everyone always thinks has been done to death."
Zombie for Sale,89,78,audience,"So funny. Between this one, Train to Busan and Alive, Koreans have become the masters of zombie movies."
Zombie for Sale,89,78,audience,"If you are watching this expecting to see a Zombie movie this is not the movie for you. They are trivializing the genere too much. No ""edge of your seat"" action, no horror, no post-apocalypse. Just a bad attempt at comedy."
Zombie for Sale,89,78,audience,The movie starts off really strong with its unique take on the zombie genre but with a run time of over 2 hrs the premise quickly loses steam and the movie becomes a chore to get through.
Zombie for Sale,89,78,audience,"Zany, hilarious and almost cartoon-like movie about a family offering at a cost to elderly villagers the opportunity to get bitten by a young zombie and thus get revitalised. Highly entertaining and sometimes thrilling."
Zombie for Sale,89,78,audience,Hilarious and heart-warming! Loved it :)
Zombie for Sale,89,78,audience,AWESOME ZOMBIE FILM EVER
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
The film riffs on a lot of previous zombie films from ""Land of the Dead"" to ""Warm Bodies"" to ""Zombieland,"" yet director Lee Min-jae manages to somehow keep it all fresh and decidedly funny.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
""Zombie for Sale"" hits an agreeable median between being slick, shaggy, grotesque and warmhearted.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
Audiences will be so connected with the characters that by the time it becomes a horror movie, Zombie for Sale will be all the more effective.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
This light-on-gore horror satire directed by Lee Min-jae is full of screwy, truly imaginative ideas, and delightfully acted by a terrific ensemble.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
When it finally does become a horror flick, the characters are so well-realized that the humor remains and the terror is that much more effective.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
If you're going to take the dread away from the horror, then the comedy needs to be front and center. Zombie For Sale just flounders around on dry land like an undead fish out of water.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
A fun movie.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
A quirky, often ingenious film, Zombie For Sale keeps things pretty light whilst bringing a series of surprises to the screen - and the genre. It's great entertainment throughout, if you allow its profound silliness to carry you along.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
Proves to be one of the most exhilarating efforts in recent years, making for a damn good time.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
A fun zombie comedy that is more about the laughs than the scares. Light and entertaining if a little too unoriginal at times.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
Zombie For Sale is just as competent as Train to Busan, which is a remarkable thing considering how it is director Lee Min-jae's first feature film.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
Simply not as infectious as its glowing reputation would have you believe.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
A hoot -- cleverly conceived, amusingly-executed, comically satisfying.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
I found The Odd Family: Zombie on Sale to be a surprisingly hilarious and moving take on the zombie genre that still traffics in the familiar tropes you'd expect.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
Lee Min-jae's feature debut is a smalltown romzomcom (with sly social commentary) that keeps gleefullly subverting the tropes of its own subgenre...
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
Working as an anti-Train to Busan, Zombie For Sale is light, breezy, oh so silly, and infectiously fun.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
You can't go wrong with a good zombie caper film, and first-time director Lee Min-Jae's great script is full of dry humour and lots of heart.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
Odd Family is solid proof that the horror-comedy genre continues to go from strength to strength and that Asian cinema, especially that of South Korean origin, is the best it has even been and we for one could not be happier.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
The film's flagrant disregard for logic in the name of gleeful entertainment is part of its charm.
 "
Zombie for Sale,89,78,critic,"
This film is a total mish mash and I mean that in a good/great way. A bit of romance, A bit of action. Tons of comedy. And zombies. What more could you ask from a film?

An honest documentary about Trejo's life that'll leave its audience believing in second chances.
 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"
Whether or not Trejo has actually paid his debt to society for the ills of his youth isn't for us to judge anyway. All we can know is that he's never stopped making amends.
 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"
Truly one of the most heartfelt documentaries I've seen in quite some time. There are emotional punches at every turn, strong interview choices to back the stories, and a figure at the center of the story that's awe-inspiring.
 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"
After a harrowing first hour, the rest of the documentary is almost relentlessly upbeat.
 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"

 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"
This would be the kind of documentary that makes itself-but Harvey, Scorgie, and company add a level of truth to the tale that makes it punch harder.
 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"
What sets Brett Harvey's slickly made documentary apart, besides its engaging subject, is its convincing portrayal of a man who saw the error of his ways and worked to change himself.
 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"
Like Trejo, the documentary is rough, rugged, and undeniably fascinating.
 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"
The astronomical rise that actor Danny Trejo has experienced, as told in the documentary Inmate #1, is fascinating. Not only did Trejo ascend from the ground up, he had to dig himself from the depths before even hitting the horizon.
 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo is not only the rare documentary about a living actor whose life truly deserves such treatment, his story and presence is so compelling and uplifting that you will come away from it wishing that there was more of it.

There are a lot of laughs in his Hollywood redemption story, which also reveals Trejo's hard-won gentleness.
 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"
Trejo fans will find a great deal to enjoy here and the film also offers an insight into aspects of the film industry that don't get much coverage, going back to his days as an extra and bit part actor.
 "
Inmate #1: The Rise of Danny Trejo,100,96,critic,"
Its subject is so inherently likable that a feature-length dose of Trejo's boundless energy feels like the kind of adrenaline shot we can use right about now.

Da 5 Bloods,92,54,audience,"Man, that was a large joint...

The intentions are good, the acting (respect for Delroy Lindo) is great, the cinematography and editing good. The problem I had is that I felt there was so much going on, it's way too loaded and overlong. It's not a war film per se. It's a film about the aftermath of war. It's about brotherhood. And treasure hunting. And the mob. And then comes the action (which works well, I guess), and also some cheap, even unnecessary melodramatic moments. And man, give me a break... is it really that easy to find a forty-something-year-old buried corpse? Please...

Rambo and The Expendables get a satisfying tribute, while Apocalypse Now just happens to be some nightclub's name (whoever thinks this film gets any close to this last one is just so wrong).

And to finish this review, the score. Why is no one talking about it? Terence Blanchard makes the greatest effort of all to try and make this film sound (and feel) as epic and adventurous as it can't be on its own."
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,audience,"It's good, has a lot of good history. But it tries to tell too many stories: black soldiers in Nam, how it shaped the country, PTSD, father and son relationships, land mind removal, and probably something else. It ended up being a bit too long because of it. If they cut out some stuff it could've been tighter and better for it. I liked the interspersal of pictures of the historical people they would talk about to highlight them."
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,audience,Great movie.  Delroy Lindo scared the crap out of me.  Only critique would be the mini dropped in history lessons seemed forced at times.
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,audience,"Spoilers ahead !Though one to follow, and not something  than I anticipated, I adored the present cultural references about the BLM  movement, on this note, the movie has been pretty upfront with its intentions. What I didn't see coming was the quest for literal gold that dehumanized the bond between veterans, a theme less likely to be brought together with the ones we all know and expected in this movie. The jungle unfolds a micro-universe where the blood blends with guilt, lies, and the fact that they return to die in the place they escaped of shows that a war, whether it is against others or yourself, can't  have its wounds compensated by no amount of gold, nor it can reassure a peace within yourself, unless  you forgive and give back for what's left of you. It was so much more emotional and devastating to see Chadwick in this movie as a character close to who he was and what he represented for everyone, it was a touching tribute for his kindness and humanity. In contrast to Normin, I wasn't  fond of Paul unleashing and the prevalence of his insanity (not even after finding why), so no compassion felt for his character's life story. 
Another key point that stuck with me is the entrance into the jungle on Marvin Gaye's song, that's about when the movie really begins. I thought Eddie exploding (a death a la Tarantino almost) would be a turnout point, but it was one to disaster. Many things still don't make enough sense for me in terms of impact (I find David a rather undeveloped character) and when we're reaching the end, I'm still a little disturbed about what had just happened. Jean Reno, Paul's fondness of Trump, that damn stupid hat were exceptional additions. The ending takes us all in a good place, of forgiveness, thirst for justice and makes the sacrifices pay off in a way, I like that we return from 2020 Vietnam post war jungle in our world, not just the characters'."
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,audience,preachy social commentary and filming style don't work. Delroy Lindo is great but I can't say the same thing for the rest of the cast.
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,audience,"Even with the odd pacing and not always efficient storytelling, this film has a good message that it is trying to get across. Spike Lee is one of the few directors that are able to tackle messages in both good and bad ways. In films like Da 5 Bloods, he is able to do it with a great amount of brilliance. This film is extremely thrilling at times and uses genre cliches in unique ways to reclaim a historical narrative. It works on pretty much every level. It will work as a conversation piece, an action movie, and a comedy. It gives the audience superb performances, especially by Lindo, and is able to bring back Marvin Gaye's ""What's Going On"" as one of the best anti-war songs of all time. Spike Lee has made a movie that not only speaks about the past but also feels very relevant for today.


Full analysis - https://backseatdirectors.com/2020/06/review-da-5-bloods/"
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,audience,"Da 5 Bloods is beautiful from start to finish.  It has Oscar worthy everything, ranging from acting to screenplay, especially from the late Chadwick Boseman as well as the brilliant Delroy Lindo.  It delves into many important topics, such as PTSD, mistreatment of vets, the African-American struggle, and more.  One of the best films of the year, everyone needs to see Da 5 Bloods, not only because it's an awesome ride, but it educates us on vital history."
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,audience,"Despite great performances from several of the lead characters, the story is awful. It's essentially ""City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold,"" except we're supposed to take it seriously because there's half a Wikipedia page with history thrown into the mix."
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,audience,Spike Lee film on Netflix where four African American Vietnam War vets return to the country to search for the remains of a fallen comrade and a hidden gold fortune. Delroy Lindo is the key here but it also features the late Chadwick Boseman in flashbacks as their deceased friend. Has a lot of ambition and is beautifully shot on location in Vietnam and Thailand.  Sometimes it has too much going on but thats cause Lee has a lot to say here.
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,audience,"Lengthy to weave in this The Warriors meets Full Metal Jacket vs. Raiders of the Lost Ark; Da 5 Bloods is a film about greed , pride, nationalism, and ignorance. The whimsical soundtrack doesn't fit the mines going off and the images of babies heads being blown off, but the story really puts emphasis on the brotherly love the term ""blood"" once meant, before gang culture turned the word into a thing of hate."
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Boseman's final scene, a mystical passage in which one of the Bloods envisions Norman visiting him with a message of forgiveness, was originally merely the emotional high point of the film; now it seems almost supernaturally inspired.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Da 5 Bloods has its faults, but it offers food for thought, and we can't really have enough of that right now.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Director Spike Lee is no stranger to highlighting forgotten heroes. His latest film Da5Bloods depicts the story of Black Vietnam Veterans.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Da 5 Bloods is a powerful blend of Spike Lee's skills as educator and entertainer.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Da 5 Bloods works equally as well as film that can entertain as it does in delivering a message for those willing to hear it.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Spike Lee movies are like onions. Peel off a layer and there's a new one beneath. Take that off and another reveals itself. His latest, Da 5 Bloods, is even more multi-faceted than usual.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
[Spike] Lee creates a powerful parallel to our dystopian times and raises an incisive commentary on racism through the lens of the Vietnam War.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Da 5 Bloods is quite some undertaking. By and large Lee succeeds, even if along the way the story hits some cul-de-sacs...
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Spike Lee has never been more vibrant or urgent.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Spike Lee hits it out of the park again with this time-hopping Vietnam War drama.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Parts of it are brilliant; other parts, frankly, tedious or undercooked.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
This is no dry history lesson about the past. It is a rousing adventure tale, that also happens to have lots to say about racism and history along the way. This is yet another excellent Spike Lee movie.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Da 5 Bloods accelerates Spike Lee's devolution into paranoid incoherence.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
With terrific editing pairing archival films of the Vietnam War with the present-day former veterans' visit, ""Da 5 Bloods"" could stand as this year's best ensemble work.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Protracted and unpolished, this post-war treasure-hunt film is somewhat repetitive in some of the ideas, and it could have been even worse if it wasn't for Lindo's strong performance.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
From its sweeping jungle vistas to its full-fat orchestral score from Terence Blanchard, Da 5 Bloods often feels like an old-fashioned Hollywood adventure. But reality keeps pushing its way through in ways that can't be ignored.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Spike Lee's body of work is a weaponised mirror of Black Lives in America. Nobody does it better.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
By the end, you'll be spent, dazed, perhaps even confused - but stunned, too, at the audacity of it all and the feeling that it is, so unequivocally, the right movie at the right time.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
Enervated by Lee's awesomely forthright style, it scrapes its fingernails against profundity. Lindo gives one of the performances of the year.
 "
Da 5 Bloods,92,54,critic,"
A melodrama with substance, a story that tends to be demonstrative and emotional, that instructs and excites. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Vast of Night,92,66,audience,"While it is beautifully shot and has a suitably bone-chilling atmosphere, creepy stories alone do not make a film worth watching. As someone who can sit down and listen to scary stories and UFO sitings for hours on end, this film kept me consistently disinterested with its choice to linger on shots and follow characters for minutes on end and its failure to present its creepy stories with any sort of panache or intrigue. The film has ideas that fall flat due to an inabillity to present anything of substance till the final 20 minutes."
The Vast of Night,92,66,audience,"After a confusing start, this micro-budgeted Alien Abduction movie really gets under your skin through pure ingenuity and suggestion. Rarely, since Gareth Edwards' Monsters (2010), has an indie genre movie been that efficient on this kind of budget."
The Vast of Night,92,66,audience,Interesting plot that moves quickly and holds your attention.
The Vast of Night,92,66,audience,"regardless of how much coffee you pumped in to your body, you will find yourself drifting off to sleep watching this. the scenes are way too long , the conversations tortuous and tedious. a 30 minute conversation should be not more than 20 seconds. even if you budget is only a few hundred bucks, there are much better ways to do a film than this."
The Vast of Night,92,66,audience,"I waited a long time to see this, and, now that I finally have, I can honestly say it wasn't at all worth it. This quasi-kitschy sci-fi offering exclusively from Amazon Prime is stylishly filmed with an inventive sound design, but that's about it. The tediously long-winded monologues in which characters expound on their allegedly extraordinary experiences are far from groundbreaking and told in such painfully dull detail that they could put even hard core insomniacs to sleep. If you're interested in hearing a more compelling account about lights in the sky and alien abduction, just tune in to any episode of Coast to Coast AM radio on the subject; you'll be better rewarded there. The treatment of such material here is so ordinary and already familiar that there is absolutely nothing new, original or imaginative about it. Even the camp factor, which could have been played up for laughs to relieve the incessant boredom, is largely left on the table. How this ended up on a number of Top 10 lists for 2019 is beyond me."
The Vast of Night,92,66,audience,"Man, that was nice and creepy. Sent chills through my spine. Really enjoyed it. Good concept, good execution. Great monologues too."
The Vast of Night,92,66,audience,Its like The X Files and The Twilight Zone had a baby and this is what it gets created. The best part of the movie it's the storytelling of the characters and how they make you play with your own imagination instead of showing you with movie scenes.
The Vast of Night,92,66,audience,"Tedious, tendentious, juvenile, plotless, and boring."
The Vast of Night,92,66,audience,They aimed for something with this movie and hit in in the exact right spot. Simply riveting.
The Vast of Night,92,66,audience,The richness of all the different types of audio in this was captivating. I was hanging on every word and every long shot.
The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
This captivating debut feature pays affectionate and mischievous homage to 1950s sci-fi.

The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
The Vast of Night is a master class in how to tell a compelling story with an economy of resources. Through stellar writing, great acting, and attention to detail, the film should be considered one of the best of 2020.
 "
The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
It's good, at times very good.
 "
The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
A thoroughly immersive time capsule that recreates an era when the space above our heads contained multitudes, rascally Soviets could be hiding around any corner, and the nighttime was full of terrifying possibility.

The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
""The Vast of Night"" is an entertaining sci-fi nostalgia piece that's made with an unusually high level of technical flair.

The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
A low-fi genre gem that proves the age-old maxim that less is often more-especially when such minimalism is wielded by gifted artists.
 "
The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
Between its two leads and fast-paced storytelling, THE VAST OF NIGHT is a dazzling tribute to the science fiction of the 1950s and the art of radio.
 "
The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
A dialogue-driven sci-fi stunner, The Vast of Night is a breath of fresh air.
 "
The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
This movie is said to be made on a shoestring budget, but this, save for a few minutes towards the end, does not show at all. Sure, it is no Interstellar, but the camerawork by Miguel Ioann Littin Menz is quite wonderful.
 "
The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
We've all stared up into the dark, knowing we can't really conceive of what we're looking at.
 "
The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
Despite the goofs, omissions and the obvious limitations of a low budget, this film is pretty effective because of its breathless pace and solid acting.

The technical proficiency of Patterson's debut is off the charts, and it'll be interesting to see if and how this gifted filmmaker manages to maintain his independence...
 "
The Vast of Night,92,66,critic,"
One of the most astonishing feature debuts in recent memory...
 "

There's simply no gainsaying the ambition, or the creativity in the problem solving. Whether it adds up to a movie worth watching... eh.

Ernesto's journey in this well-made, dramatic, and uncompromising movie reveals facts he believes all Guatemalans need to know. [Director Cesar] Diaz's story is personal and drawn from what happened to his own family.
 "

 "
Our Mothers,71,,critic,"
It wants to tell us the truth, rather than a story about the truth, and that dulls its emotional impact a little.
 "
Our Mothers,71,,critic,"
A moving story about a compassionate young man investigating the impact of genocide in his country.
 "

Trolls World Tour,70,58,audience,"I enjoyed this one with the family as I thought it was cleverly done to tie all genres of music together and the importance of each along with the importance of how it defines us. I also enjoyed the underlying theme that we may be all different and come from different lands, but we need to be united in our cause for humanity"
Trolls World Tour,70,58,audience,"This Movie is boring, has annoying characters, an unengaging story and put the nail in the coffin for the destruction of movie theatres."
Trolls World Tour,70,58,audience,"While Trolls World Tour doesn't out-sing the original, it makes up for it with incredible animation and talented voice actors. Co-directors Dohrn and Smith explore new characters and new music, delivering a bright and immersive world. Although the plot's derivative and struggles to stay within one lane, it's a brisk 90-minutes. One could argue that if Trolls World Tour had been released in cinemas, it would be considered a mediocre follow-up… but given to the world in times of uncertainty and segregation, it serves as a good-hearted metaphor to embrace diversity. Even if you're not a Trolls fan, the ultimate message is something that should be sung from the rooftops."
Trolls World Tour,70,58,audience,"If you are looking to recapture the magic that was the first film, you will be disappointed. Don't misunderstand me, I still think the movie is worth a watch with a kids. I see many mention their issues with the plot but I thought it was fine. Not the most original story but I would give it a pass. What killed this movie for me was some of the worst covers I have heard in music film. These are incredibly gifted singers but the only song I can say I honestly enjoyed was Kelly Clarkson with Born To Die. Perhaps a better song selection would have made this better, but the meat and potatoes of the Trolls series is it's music but that is what I feel was the most poorly executed."
Trolls World Tour,70,58,audience,"""Trolls World Tour"" é uma animação empolgante, que expande o que foi apresentado no primeiro filme. A trilha sonora é divertida, assim como a historia do filme em geral, só poderia ter um desfecho um pouco menos óbvio, com a vilã 100% do mal se arrependendo de seus atos e se juntando aos mocinhos. Já estamos cansados de ver isso, não é?"
Trolls World Tour,70,58,audience,"It's good, I'd recommend it"
Trolls World Tour,70,58,audience,"Having loved the first Trolls movie, me and my wife had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately it was one of the worst movies we had ever seen. It felt like it had no actual storyline, tried to force characters down our throats( especially one voiced by James Corden who was around the main characters for half the movie just because it's James Corden) The premise had so much potential to use an infinite amount of amazing songs from every genre instead felt so rushed and poor. Being the first movie to come straight to us instead of the cinemas, their failure to deliver was even more impactful."
Trolls World Tour,70,58,audience,"A few feel good moments, but this film is all over the place without any real plot. "
Trolls World Tour,70,58,audience,"It was a very fun and really entertaining DreamWorks animated movie sequel. It had really gorgeous animation, really well done voice cast, really great characters, really colorful visuals, really amazing magic, really excellent humor, really fun music, really astounding adventure and a really interesting story. In my opinion, I really like this one better than the first one. I really recommend this movie to both kids and adults."
Trolls World Tour,70,58,audience,"cavity inducing sugar nothingness. Bad covers of songs and nothing much else. It isn't terrible but there is nothing here with a generic message about being yourself and tolerance of other peoples music taste (and other things of course, accept differences kids!)"
Trolls World Tour,70,58,critic,"
Trolls World Tour is nowhere near the quality of the first film, with fleeting fun attached to mostly forgettable songs.
 "
Trolls World Tour,70,58,critic,"
What's missing is the wonderful weirdness that made the original Trolls film the strangest children's entertainment since H.R. Pufnstuf. Story wise, this one feels formulaic with less of an edge.

Once again, 'Trolls Word Tour' reiterates what we have known all along but some of us chose to ignore or may have forgotten: music is the universal language of the universe.

Even with so much spelled out, the significance of this very abstract parable will be best appreciated by the adults in the room, just as the trippy visuals (often quite imaginative) belong to the same tradition of knowingly warped storybook imagery.

Families are home craving content to entertain the kids. ""Trolls World Tour"" accomplishes this with flying colors (quite literally), as the folks at DreamWorks Animation turn an animated journey into a unique music history lesson.
 "
Trolls World Tour,70,58,critic,"
Trolls World Tour has a message that people can live peacefully while respecting each other's differences. It's a message that comes wrapped in a lot of musical numbers and action sequences, but it's something that audiences can take to heart.

There's just no heart, soul, or true purpose in this film; something generic and robotic about every aspect of its existence.

All you can really say about Trolls World Tour is that it is a fun, but forgettable formulaic follow-up.
 "
Trolls World Tour,70,58,critic,"
Even more than the original, Trolls World Tour, is a rainbow-swathed, glitter-drenched escape from reality, and it provides the full-on fantastical at-home experience that many families are probably craving right now.

The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,audience,A view of life of regular people in China.
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,audience,"The grit and uncertainty of where it’s going is enough to hold you on through it’s initial slow pace, then when the characters become engaging things pick up. I suppose it’s neo noir, from China no less, two characteristics I don’t see too often. There’s also flashes in the pan of artistry, and when thought about the film as a whole, there is social commentary. "
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,audience,The director is a great master of film noir. The movie is visually beautiful. Every actor is great.
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,audience,"Regardless of how you personally respond to this film's vaguely structured narrative, let there be no confusion about how endlessly watchable it is. Add yet another name to the list of young(er) international filmmakers to keep your eye on for the next several years. ""The Wild Goose Lake"" plays out in most unusual fashion, yet the few moments that distract from the experience with jarring edits, unresolved conflicts within a scene that just fizzle out – instead of reaching ANY sort of definite conclusion – only amount to little missteps, keeping the overall experience of the film mostly engaging, and – at times – absolutely stunning to regard.

Let this elliptical mystery-crime story unfold effortlessly with highly clever use of blocking via silhouettes & shadows – and always drenched thickly in the plume of cigarette smoke, fog, or both. You won't regret it."
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,audience,"On the docket today a Chinese neo-noir crime thriller and it was just what the doctor ordered.  I was engaged and the few fight scenes there are have an originality.  I loved the way this was shot, but there are a couple shock value moments that may not be for everyone.  Enjoyed the way this is edited and don't be confused with some intentional misdirections just to be sure you're on your toes.  This is a long chase and the rewarding finish makes it well worth the watch when it comes to a VOD sites!  Final Score: 8.2/10"
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,audience,I want the story to be about the gone in 60 seconds type car stealing spree to determine gang supremacy that is set up in the first 10 min. The story ends up being a weak John Wick revenge plot where a guy aimlessly goes around killing everyone for 2 hours. The characters aren't defined enough to care who he is killing or even know if they are cops or gang members. The visual appeal of this movie is it's saving grace keeping it from falling in the star ratings.
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,audience,"Zhou Zenong（Hu Ge), understands this truth that  running away is not the most effective way to resist death, on the contrary,  dealing with his death freely is the  only way to make his life more meaningful.
The bruised body of Zhou was clearly marked up as an expensive piece of prey. The party at the south station(which is the Chinese name of this film) was a brutal feast, with people from all walks of life circling around like vultures, waiting for the opportunity to pounce on the dying man and take their share of the surplus value. The director has rather capriciously placed a scene of killing secondary characters in a zoo at night, making the caged beast with its eyes wide open in the light and shadows an explicit rhetoric of Zhou Zenong's fate."
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,audience,"This is a nightmare where you're running away and being chased. This time through the underbelly of second-tier suburban China, hunted by policemen and gangster groups, motives every-changing and betrayals left and right. It's surreal and sleazy, dream-like. The pace is at once languid, and then abrupt. Super stylish film, fresh and original take on classic Hollywood noir, cast in neon tones in central China."
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,audience,"A fantastic modern noir! The film is stylish, but also has great suspense and action. If it's in your area, watch it!"
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,audience,"A film that I'll end up likening to Ridley Scott's 2010 iteration of ""Robin Hood"" more than I'd like to, ""The Wild Goose Lake"" features a terrifically thrilling first act, a pulse-pounding final few scenes, but one of the more frustrating middle acts I've seen in recent memory, filled with a seemingly innumerable amount of aimless scenes with scant amounts of weight loaded into any of them. It's a shame, too, because of the aesthetics that are in play in nearly every frame. There's so many images featuring expressive lighting, deliberate blocking, and brilliant camera movements -- it's just a drag that so many of the scenes that these things occur within have very little to them circumstantially speaking. If only as much were placed into the construction of this film's second act as there was placed in its sleek and potentially indelible look."

Watching Wild Goose Lake feels like watching a society crumble in real time...
 "
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,critic,"
The Wild Goose Lake is a hoot, a Chinese crime thriller that proves Diao Yinan is a new master of dark, thrilling noir.
 "
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,critic,"
While Chinese director Diao Yinan's The Wild Goose Lake hardly reconfigures the crime thriller afresh, it does pare it down to the essentials to exhilarating effect...
 "
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,critic,"
A perfect depiction of the inhumanity of an unfeeling city.
 "
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,critic,"
Diao has a knack for noir, but he puts his own stamp on the material with an occasionally quirky and idiosyncratic tone.
 "
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,critic,"
The innovative and slick cinematography by Dong Jingsong is a reason to see the film in its own right; Yinan's adroit ebb and flow of violence and plot twists is another, as is Gwei's alluringly enigmatic tagalong.
 "
The Wild Goose Lake,92,69,critic,"
Diao subtly combines crime and drama to underline a social commentary on the Chinese underworld, executed in a highly compelling visual style that portrays that section of society with sordid realism. [Full review in Spanish]

Wendy,38,75,audience,A spectacular reimagining of Peter Pan. Made me tear up at the end.
Wendy,38,75,audience,"Very strange! Beautiful scenery. Unbelievable, but it wasn't supposed to be believable. Seemed to drag on about in the middle and then got a little ""tied up"" and really didn't flow up until the end. I BELIEVE."
Wendy,38,75,audience,I looked at all the Bad Reviews and gave it try anyway . Benh Zeitlen reminds me of Terrance Malik. The films are wonderfully shot and our beautiful to look at. You often wonder a bit about the storyline none the less you find yourself moved.
Wendy,38,75,audience,Don't stop believing. This movie encourages you to stay true to who you are. Find that happy place and live. 
Wendy,38,75,audience,"This movie was an amazing retelling of the Peter Pan story. A little slow at times, but still worth the watch. The cinematography was beautiful and the kids were really great actors. Great family movie."

Wendy,38,75,critic,"
Wendy is a re-imagined story of one of the great classics, Peter Pan, that is better off untold.

Wendy,38,75,critic,"
This isn't a modern spin on a classic tale of fantasy and wonder, it's an outright nightmare I never want to think about ever again.
 "
Wendy,38,75,critic,"
A film of muddled mythology and listless characterization, burying its sense of childhood magic in drab new trappings that feel bland and uninspired.
 "
Wendy,38,75,critic,"
The twee onslaught of Wendy reinforces that filmmaker Benh Zeitlin's view of childhood wonder remains superficial--and racially problematic.
 "
Wendy,38,75,critic,"
The movie romanticizes young children wandering off - they're in a distant land where they don't grow old, and they run and play the whole damn time.
 "
Wendy,38,75,critic,"
Yes, it's Fantasy Island, too.
 "
Wendy,38,75,critic,"
You can find components of Peter Pan in Wendy, but locating the spirit is far more difficult. Peter had an easier time locating his shadow.

Gritty and evocative, the adventure captures the playful and imaginative spirit of its characters. However, Zeitlin's strained efforts to bridge fantasy and reality remain muddled and elusive.

Zombi Child,86,61,audience,"It may not catch your attention right away, but it clearly has plenty to look out for."
Zombi Child,86,61,audience,"Until the end, Bonello mostly suppresses traditional horror elements while favoring a more intriguing slow burn approach. This does make the finale a bit jarring but that does not undermine the film's interrogations of history."
Zombi Child,86,61,audience,"Visually beautiful.  The story lost the main character, but I enjoyed watching a lot."
Zombi Child,86,61,audience,Hard to understand voodoo!
Zombi Child,86,61,audience,Neither here nor there - didn’t really explore Haitian voodoo in full nor was it a true horror film.
Zombi Child,86,61,audience,Boring and pretentious mixture of Peter Weir's Dead poets society and Picnic at Hanging Rock + Wes Craven's Serpent and the Rainbow.
Zombi Child,86,61,audience,"Saw this at NYFF57. A muddled mess of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be. As if Bonello just took two movies he wanted to make, couldn't decide, and smashed them together like child's play-dough, trying to make the two disparate parts into one franken-film whole. The worst and most utterly ridiculous parts occur during the teen-girl horror half of the film. If this were a film school project, he get's a grade of ""D"", C- at best, if only for the effort of trying."

 "
Zombi Child,86,61,critic,"
Bonello's continent- and time-period-spanning film leads to a surprisingly emotional conclusion, and includes some beautifully haunting imagery.
 "
Zombi Child,86,61,critic,"
'Zombi Child' is not the zombie movie you're expecting. It's a wafting, interior movie, more 'I Walked with a Zombie' than 'Night of the Living Dead,' more whisper than scream.
 "
Zombi Child,86,61,critic,"
Overall, though, his ""Zombi Child"" is a haunting watch, with long sequences of girls lounging, tortured - so to speak - by boredom ... similar to the girls in Peter Weir's 1975 mystery classic ""Picnic at Hanging Rock.""

""Zombi Child"" seeks to interrogate the bitter legacy of French colonialism, from its brutal applications in the past to its spiritual and psychological reverberations in the present.

Bonello gives the film a hypnotic visual style and languorous, elliptical narrative style.
 "
Zombi Child,86,61,critic,"
Zombi Child fits neatly in with the rest of Bonello's oeuvre and is unashamed of exploring distinctly political narratives while being critical of the actions of his characters.
 "

A drearily paced drama with big ideas that is ironically as lifeless as the title suggests.

Uncut Gems,91,52,audience,"Adam Sandler is doing something amazing in this film .. working hard at acting .. This film is an edge of the seat , stressfully energetic thriller that gives the audience no time to relax. Even a performance by The Weeknd is laced with energetic performances by the whole on screen cast . I went into this film blind with no expectation and came out believing I had just watched an amazing film and witnessed the best performance Adam Sandler has ever given."
Uncut Gems,91,52,audience,"I would rather get a prostate exam than watch one of Adam Sandler's ""comedies"" but he was fantastic here.  He plays a degenerate gambler who just can't help himself  and drives everyone around him crazy while making bad decision after bad decision.  The camera and the editing help capture just how chaotic this kind of life is.  Highly recommended."
Uncut Gems,91,52,audience,"This looked pretty interesting from the previews and at times it seemed to move pretty fast but at other times, it seemed to repeat itself. Honestly, one of, if not the best Adam Sandler role I've ever seen him in. I'd like to say he deserves at least an Academy Award nomination for this, but with all of the other competition (some of which I agree with and some of which I don't), I wouldn't be surprised if they squeezed him out of the Best Actor category. I also thought they found an interesting way to incorporate Kevin Garnett throughout the film, as he is an integral part in the film and doesn't just make a cameo. An interesting study of sports gambling addiction with a depressing ending."
Uncut Gems,91,52,audience,Uncut Gems is absolutely an outstanding powerful performance by the sandman himself Adam Sandler with great script and brilliant directing by the Safdie Brothers.
Uncut Gems,91,52,audience,"The worst 2 hours of my life. Adam Sandler's Worst Role than Mr. Deeds and Little Nicky, this is terrible and painful to watch. Makes you rather watch Jack and Jill than Netflix's poor excuse to get more people on their streaming service."
Uncut Gems,91,52,audience,Watching Uncut Gems is an intense and stressful experience. Every scene feels like its infused with energy and a lot of that is achieved by an accomplished performance from Sandler. It goes to show he has the skills in his locker to pull off a dramatic role playing a degenerate gambler. There are funny moments and the movie is laced with cameo appearances from the likes of Kevin Garnett and The Weekend. I wasn't as impressed with some of the shaky 'Go Pro' style cinematography but this film is a veritable rollercoaster from start to finish.
Uncut Gems,91,52,audience,Garbage. Haven't seem such grotesque waste of film making efforts. Even tougher to watch.
Uncut Gems,91,52,audience,"Quality!

'Uncut Gems' is an absolutely thoroughly thrilling watch, the plot is so chaotic and high paced that it's practically impossible to not have a fun time with it. The cast do terrific work, typified by the tremendous Adam Sandler.

Sandler (Howard) is unquestionably the star of the film, he gets a lot of stick for a lot of the roles he usually plays but this is far from anything I've seen him portray. He still shows his funny side no doubt, but he adds much more to make it a memorable character - which is a rarity for him.

Lakeith Stanfield, Julia Fox, Kevin Garnett and Eric Bogosian are all good too. The score is pretty solid, also. There isn't much more to note really, it's a crime thriller and it absolutely nails that realm. Great film."
Uncut Gems,91,52,audience,It is just another Sandler movie with a touch of unsettling drama in a reality where Sandler's usually self entitled pricky character doesn't get everything he wants just because. I couldn't care less about the outcome of all the dumb decisions and actions of such a dumb and destructive character.
Uncut Gems,91,52,audience,I was expecting to watch a good movie. But it seems like this is just an excuse for Adam Sandler to hang with Kevin Garnett. Once again Sandler disappoints.

Sandler brings his natural likability to the role but layers it with Howard's neurosis, frustration, conniving and even joy. It's a remarkable performance powered by jet fuel

Manic and pulse-pounding, with a blistering energy, this is one hell of a ride.
 "
Uncut Gems,91,52,critic,"
Uncut Gems is driven by a solid performance by Adam Sandler in an enthralling story of gambling addiction. Above anything else, you're watching this to see Adam Sandler shine, and the chaotic drama will only keep you tuned in until the very end.

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,51,86,audience,Only good thing about whole sequels is Kylo Ren
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,51,86,audience,"A satisfying end to the Skywalker saga.

The Rise of Skywalker was a total improvement over The Last Jedi and brought back fun and action packed adventure.

Even though JJ Abrams played it safe and predictable, The Rise of Skywalker is a solid final film."

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,51,86,audience,Pace is unbearable. Story line is congested. Just entirely too ambitious and ready to serve. You expect steak but get an old school TV dinner. I lived for SW as a kid- but can’t rewatch this one. It’s jacked.

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,51,86,audience,"I genuinely really like this movie. It's definitely not the best star wars movie in my books, but it's still great. I don't know if I just absolutely LOVE star wars, but this movie was great. I'm not ashamed to say that some scenes made me cry, LOL. Overall, great movie, not the best, but great."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,51,86,audience,"Good special effects, but they butchered the franchise. Sadly"
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,51,86,audience,"For anyone who hated THE LAST JEDI, rest assured, JJ Abrams gave you a worthy conclusion to this trilogy. This is on par with THE FORCE AWAKENS (if not better). At times a wonderfully dark film that paces well as the longest Star Wars at 2 hours and 21 minutes. For everything that has been written about this new trilogy over the years, while I was never a big fan of it and I won't miss these characters as much as other characters from the past, I hope this is indeed the end of the cannon. If Disney wants to do spinoffs or movies with new characters, that's fine. I think over the course of the last 40+ years, this cow's been milked dry."

 "
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,51,86,critic,"
Attempting to reverse all of the details in the prior film, this hackneyed adventure finishes out the third ""Star Wars"" trilogy well enough, but does so in a surprisingly disappointing fashion in spite of its own positive qualities.

Waves,84,81,audience,"From the trailer the movie seemed like it had great potential though after watching the film it did not live up to my expectations with to much experimental cinematography, dragged out story line split into what seems to be two different movies with a lot of popular music aimed to captivate the younger generation thrown in. Overall not worth the time."
Waves,84,81,audience,"Waves easily becomes one of my favorite films in the long run. Stunning visually and poetically, it offers a range of emotions that we all have but are afraid to confront."
Waves,84,81,audience,extremely important story and visually gorgeous 
Waves,84,81,audience,"Alluring camerawork, an arresting score and lighting and excellent acting performances are among the stand-out features in this absorbing, sometimes intense and always excellent family drama"
Waves,84,81,audience,"Didn't know much about this movie, decided to watch it because of the good reviews and a great rating. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of it and the performances of the cast.

Sterling K.Brown plays perfectly the role of a father who pushes his kid too much, Kelvin Harrison Jr. does a brilliant job portraying an athlete who is dealing with many problems at once that eventually become his downfall, Lucas Hedges and Taylor Russell bring a beautiful and tragic story to the second part of this movie that is very well acted and delivered.

Alexa Demie's acting was a bit underwhelming for my taste but overall a very good movie.

The cinematography is quite unusual, in a positive way, using circling shots throughout the movie but also choosing gorgeous scenery that represent the characters, like when Kelvin's character is running alongside many bridges that seem like they are intertwining depicting his life at that moment and Taylor's character freely riding a bike with her arms wide open like a moment of acceptance after everything she's been through.

I would definitely recommend this movie."
Waves,84,81,audience,"It's a deep movie, with a introspective point in all of it. Great soundtrack too"
Waves,84,81,audience,"Tough, punchy, vibey. A24 in spades. Good writing, but felt like it pulls its punches in the second half after such a hard-hitting first act."
Waves,84,81,audience,"The performances are good, but this is one of the most depressing films I've seen."
Waves,84,81,audience,"Will surely go down as one on of the best films of the year. It's so beautiful, and so brilliantly acted. I couldn't take my eyes off it."
Waves,84,81,audience,"The first half of Waves was well-executed (though heinous and not what people will expect based on the trailer).  The second half of Waves is a waste of time.   And the 2 halves are not persuasively thematically connected to each other.  They are 'factually' connected: both involve the same family.  And I appreciate (a) the value of follow up re: the consequences of the 1st half on everyone and (b) the symmetry played out in the hour of the 2nd half, that the Brother did something unforgivable but the Sister is not prepared to forgive him, but the Boyfriend's Father did something unforgivable but the Sister encourages the Boyfriend to forgive his father... However, the follow up in the 2nd half should have been alot tighter and more focused on the thematic ties to the first half.  As it is, 2nd half feels weak, meaningless, 'tacked on', a waste of time."

Waves is both an emotionally rewarding and shattering experience. No one would want to confront the demons that the family in this film have to face, but Trey Shults has made a film journey that's well worth taking.

Although well-paced, largely due to the zippy cinematographic gimmicks, there's essentially more than one film here.
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
A poetically visceral gem about masculinity, forgiveness, and family.
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
Waves simply cannot be viewed as a passive, cinematic experience; Its upfront, rollercoaster refusal to entertain that perspective just highlights how uniquely rare it is to watch a film that purposely leaves a profound effect on you.
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
Waves is a tense, unrelenting film. There's not a lot of reprieve for audiences. It's like watching someone self-destruct in slow motion and yet be powerless to stop them.
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
""Waves"" is a journey not easily forgotten. This is a film where romance, family relations, and heartache are all delved into insightfully, as the emotional experiences go from the raw to the tender.

I will be watching the career of Kelvin Harrison jr, his performance here as Tyler is so very powerful and anchors one of the best films of the year so far.
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
It deals with some very serious material in a raw, disturbing way, but I promise you will never forget it. It's a thoughtful film that teaches us life lessons about parenting, self control, forgiveness and unconditional love.
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
The audacious stylistic choices and powerful performances immerse us into a downward spiral before gentle acts of solidarity reconnect the characters.
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
All the performances are excellent and perfectly pitched between reality and melodrama. And visually the film follows the same pattern: very creatively photographed by Drew Daniels, it also succeeds in being both ""real"" and heightened...
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
The success of this unpredictable melodrama... hinges upon the breakout performances of its two young leads.
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
Shults is saying nothing new here. Nor does he exploit or trivialise the African-American experience. It's a powerful and plausible tale but it's told with such a bombardment of sound and image that he leaves you no opportunity to think for yourself.
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
Both a stirring and sobering experience, a film that tests your nerves before calming them exponentially
 "
Waves,84,81,critic,"
It's not subtle, and it could have lost twenty minutes easily, but Waves is a stylish, moving film that's more than worth a look
 "

The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,28,78,audience,"This is a fascinating story, the lead actress does a great job adding humanity to this larger than life historical figure, and the battle scenes are awesome.

The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,28,78,audience,We really liked this film because: 1) it is a very interesting story 2) it is filmed and performed by East Asian Indians so it has an authentic feel 3) it shows the British as bigoted invaders and the Indians as compassionate humans 4) and it is inspirational.

The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,28,78,audience,"The Warrior Queen of Jhansi disposes of the idea that biopics about the geopolitical disputes of colonial era royalty must be boring. Not coincidentally, it also disposes of the idea that the only worthy subjects of ""serious"" historical films are old white men. Both the action and the subject matter are refreshing. The cinematography and directing are both beautiful. And Devika Bhise delivers an absolutely exceptional performance as the main protagonist. You must go see this film!"

Altogether it's a rousing, passionate bit of film-making on a reasonably epic scale, with a cast of hundreds deployed for some big dusty battle scenes, which are duly impressive.
 "
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,28,78,critic,"
For the lack of good acting, mostly resulting from poor dialogue, the movie at least manages to represent its characters as genuinely believable figures of a real history. That's the least you can ask for from a historical biopic.

There's little doubt that Rani's story is an engaging and undertold chapter of history, but The Warrior Queen of Jhansi is not the best way to tell it.

 "
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,28,78,critic,"
While I am glad it opened my eyes to this warrior woman of the 1800s who dared defy the British, I'm frustrated that the filmmakers failed to find a way to bring the story to life with more artistry.

Created by a mother/daughter team, they seem more concerned about enlightening audience instead of telling a compelling narrative. A phenomenal freedom fighter like Rani Lakshmibai deserves a much more thrilling depiction, but it's still worth a watch.
 "
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi,28,78,critic,"
The Warrior Queen of Jhansi is not just about a warrior queen... Bringing emotion, drama, and truth to the forefront, this is a film for every mother, daughter, grandmother, sister, and friend - each a warrior every day of their lives.

Such reports confirm that transparency is possible, and that light can dispel darkness"

The Report,82,83,audience,"Adam Driver eccezionale, posato e determinato, senza mai un eccesso nella frustrazione.
Il film racconta di una storia veramente complessa da portare sul grande schermo; nel complesso lo fa bene."
The Report,82,83,audience,Made politics interesting but also very infuriating 
The Report,82,83,audience,"Stellar performances by Adam Driver, matches the intense storytelling skills of director Scott Burns.

It gives you a behind the scenes look at how something like a Senate Investigation Report comes into being, especially when dealing with a crime of magnitude no less than damaging America's credibility in the world as moral leader.

I have much to say, but a lot of it would tread on the familiar political divide of Republican and Democrat. Suffice it to say, this movie and the true story is above that, it's about the courageous men and women who stand up to fight the good fight and follow the law and uphold the rule of law - and are not afraid to speak out against anyone, especially their own party.

A  true story that's matched by a great film. 
Adam Driver plays the Senate investigator Daniel J. Jones (@DanielJJonesUS) who is now my favorite human of 2020!"
The Report,82,83,audience,"I’m a big fan of a legal drama, and when you raise the stakes and make it all about a governmental cover-up, then you’ve really piqued my interest. I expected to like The Report a lot, and it did deliver some of the thrills that I enjoy from this type of drama. It’s also extra impactful because it is all based on the real history of our nation. The other thing I appreciated about The Report is that it felt fairly apolitical. Sure, there are politicians who were involved in the planning and coverup of these detention centers, but there were definite mistakes made on both sides of the aisle when it comes to the handling of this information and the movie didn’t shy away from that point. I also thought Adam Driver did a good job of playing a character who slowly escalates from dispassionate to fanatical as he spends more time working on this project. Perhaps my only complaint in the actors is that many of the CIA agents were played a bit over-the-top as conniving bad guys. The unfortunate thing is that I don’t think they did the best job of making The Report cinematic, and it lacked something in the story-telling department. Constantly recounting the atrocities done by members of the CIA, while showing many of them re-enacted, works to make a point and to shock the audience. However, at a certain point we get what they are trying to say, and yet they keep saying it for another hour. It begins to feel like the film-makers are reveling in the display of torture as much as those who performed the tortures. I can’t count the number of times they repeat things in this film, and it wasn’t advancing the story in any way. Meanwhile, there are more compelling parts of the movie that stall out with no explanation of any kind (like the main character’s meeting with a lawyer.) I certainly think The Report contains important information and it is a story that needed to be told, I only wish it was told by someone who was more skilled than a guy who wrote a few mediocre Soderbergh movies."
The Report,82,83,audience,Absolutly horrific - must see.
The Report,82,83,audience,"The movie does a very good job of condensing a very complicated subject, encompassing a long period of time, into an understandable and comprehensive summary.  The device of coupling a lie told by the agency/administration with a statement of truth from the investigation in order made the impact necessary to get the point across.  This should not be confused with being a documentary.  The bias shows through, from the tone and posture certain characters use, tot the settings in which certain conversations take place.  However, to those who are interested, this movie is a good starter to finding out more information about these disturbing events."
The Report,82,83,audience,"This movie tells an important story, so it's great to have it made into an entertaining movie that kept my attention from start to finish. I particularly liked the recorded John McCain speech from the senate floor that ends the movie (don't worry - not a spoiler)."

The film's closing sequence that sees Jones walk out of the Senate building after the report is finally made public is testament to Burns' steely determination to make a movie that didn't get lost in its theatrics.

Ford v Ferrari,92,98,audience,Everything that you would expect from Bale and Damon in a project together.
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,audience,Muito bom! Mas não assistiria de novo. O ponto mais forte pra mim é a amizade dos dois. A parte de corrida ficou lindo de ver também.
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,audience,"James Mangold is a little hit (COP LAND, WALK THE LINE, LOGAN) and miss for me (3:10 TO YUMA, THE WOLVERINE). But I went in to this expecting good things and while it's entertaining, with a lot of racing, the films seems basic to me. I've heard Oscar rumors swirling around Bale's and Damon's performances (Bale's I can agree with, Damon's is a bit of a stretch for me). Other than that duo, the film is pretty flat."
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,audience,"O filme é uma belíssima obra de arte, com diálogos interessantes e relevantes, as cenas de corridas fazem você não tirar o olho da tela por um segundo, a história e roteiro são quase que totalmente fiéis aos acontecimentos reais, para mim o filme só tem uns errinhos quase imperceptíveis o que faz ele ser quase perfeito."
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,audience,"The film is very well written and acted. All relevant characters are fun to follow, Cristian Bale is a standout.  The levels of conflict are well interwoven, very impressive considering that it's based on real events. The film also looks very nice, especially during the racing scenes."
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,audience,I enjoyed this movie so much. The ending is a bit disappointing but life is sad in that way. The acting is great and it was suspenseful.
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,audience,Wow. I can't believe Hollywood can still produce a movie this good. You have to watch this movie.
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,audience,"Ford v Ferrari is a dramatization of developments within Ford's racing program during the mid 60's.  Matt Damon and Christian Bale star in dual lead roles.  Damon delivers a solid performance while Bale's may be a little lacking.  For his role, Bale must adopt an English accent.  Rather than sounding like a Brit from Birmingham, he sounds like an American impersonating Michael Caine.  The acting chemistry between Damon and Bale is poor.  A really big asset in this movie is the performance of the supporting cast.  Most notable is Josh Lucas as the unlikable, power hungry executive who steps in the way.  Ray McKinnon also deserves high praise.  The film has good production value, with technological advancements over the last few decades resulting in vastly improved action scenes (as compared to older racing films).  Numerous sub-plots exist within the movie to keep things interesting.  A really good film that does not emotionally drain nor intellectually overtax the audience."
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,audience,"While I'm happy that audiences and critics alike aren't as firmly against cliches as they once were, this movie pushed me over the edge a bit. This movie was just not for me. At all."
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,audience,"While I enjoyed the movie and thought it did a pretty good job of telling the story, I did notice a number of technical glitches. Most people who are interested in a movie such as this are gearheads like myself and pay particular attention to the technical details. Here are a couple of the goof-ups; the scene of an engine running on a dyno without a single fuel line connected to the carburetor; the scene where Ken Miles comes in from a test drive complaining of the car's power and Phil Remington says to rebuild the Holley carburetor throttle shafts, yet fuel injector or Weber carb stacks can clearly be seen behind Ken's head. There are several others but I just wish film makers would pay more attention to the technical details in movies like this."
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,critic,"
Ford v Ferrari could have been better, delving into more specifics for those of us who aren't intimately familiar with the history. But the performances of the stacked cast and the intensity of the various racing scenes make up for that lack.

[Director James Mangold] humanizes this true story, making it interesting for those with extensive car knowledge and palatable for others, like this reviewer, who wouldn't be able to locate the engine with a gun to her head.

It's not often a movie breaks no ground whatsoever, is chock full of clichés, is two-and-a-half hours long, and somehow still finds a way to be completely entertaining.
 "
Ford v Ferrari,92,98,critic,"
As expected, Damon and Bale are very good here, the former finding ways to inject sly humor into the stoic Shelby, the later reveling in Miles broad nature.

The Midnight Sky,51,26,audience,"Cant believe how bad this movie is. Its mind numbingly boring and full of dumb writing. Pregnant astronaut. That should be enough to tell you how bad this film is. Here's some more. Something destroyed the entire planet Earth, but nobody ever even mentions it, and its never explained in the slightest. Young Clooney is played by some random guy that looks nothing like he did 20 years ago, when anyone with an internet connection could just deepfake that shit. And MASSIVE SPOILER!!!!! The friggin kid isnt even real. She's just a figment, despite them showing her off doing her own thing out of Clooney's point if view numerous times and even picking up his gun at one point. F#@K YOU movie. Hell, even the music sucked."
The Midnight Sky,51,26,audience,"What a snooze-fest! What's with all these sci-fi movies nowadays that think they can be ""atmospheric"" and get away with not telling an actual story? Tone alone does not a movie make..."
The Midnight Sky,51,26,audience,It was bad. Really bad. No surprises. Just long drawn out plot going nowhere.
The Midnight Sky,51,26,audience,The reason for so many story lines is that otherwise they couldn't pack in every cliche imaginable.
The Midnight Sky,51,26,audience,This was the worst George Clooney movie i've ever seen
The Midnight Sky,51,26,audience,"I suppose it may be some people's cup of tea, but for me the story is just way to depressing. There is no value in this film, it's beautifully shot, well acted and deeply emotional, yes, but ultimately it's devoid of any purpose other than to make us all feel sad. There's enough of that around as it is."
The Midnight Sky,51,26,audience,"This movie was amazing, it has convinced me to spend the rest of my life actually creating a flux capacitor and installing it in a deLorean in order to go back in time to warn myself to do something better with my time."
The Midnight Sky,51,26,audience,"The second worse space movie since Ad Astra. This movie is a prime example of how poor directing, editing, and timing can destroy an entire production."
The Midnight Sky,51,26,audience,"A solemn, poignant watch with whispers of hope. Midnight Sky unveils a massive premise with a much smaller human story. Clooney directs and stars in this carefully crafted piece of filmmaking full of subtlety that's unfortunately, not seen as much in new media."
The Midnight Sky,51,26,audience,Great movie! Death scenes were quite sad. Loved the acting of George Clooney and the rest of the cast.
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
George Clooney's ""The Midnight Sky,"" like ""Monuments Men"" before it - chokes on a combination concept and a casting slam dunk.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
As the movie's focal point, Clooney is as soulful and grizzled as he's ever been. As a filmmaker, he certainly gifts himself the feature's best moments.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
Aside from Clooney looking like Lee Marvin, there's nothing interesting or all that memorable about his portrayal of a man full of regrets.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
The thoughtful, if sorrowful, post-apocalyptic drama - an adaptation of Lily Brooks-Dalton's 2016 novel Good Morning, Midnight - pulls you in and keeps you invested in its parallel stories set on earth and in space.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
The Midnight Sky doesn't have the execution to match its shoot-for-the-stars ambition. A frustrating and lethargic missed opportunity.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
Clooney uses silence to speak loudly about the film's most timely and important theme, the need for connection. It's the lesson of the film and, these days, in real life.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
The Midnight Sky is a pot of science fiction stew. It's a concoction of The Martian, Gravity, Ad Astra, and Passengers all mixed together, and because it reminds us of all of those other movies, it winds up tasting slightly unoriginal.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
The ending will almost certainly be divisive, but if you're willing to suspend disbelief a smidge and go along with it, you're sure to feel the full weight of its emotional wallop.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
The Midnight Sky is a consortium of parts that don't equal a whole. ... something for everyone, yet perhaps not enough for one person.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
Clooney has a nice feel for how to direct this type of film. The scenes in the Arctic are particularly effective, although the space-set scenes are hit-and-miss.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
Despite some impressive visuals and a compelling lead performance, The Midnight Sky stretches credulity and fails to make much of an emotional impact.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
While not a malicious film, more than anything else, it is unserious.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
I'm a fan of a tale well done that takes its time. But Midnight Sky, while well done, is simply ponderous.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
I was rooting for it...
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
Too much of it is too familiar from other places, and what it goes into isn't terribly interesting. It has all the ingredients of a great movie but it somehow does not come together.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
The Midnight Sky's reach far exceeds its grasp.
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
At worst it seems like a cheeky pastiche between 'Gravity' and the short 'Aningaaq'. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Midnight Sky,51,26,critic,"
Clooney, as well as the entire Aether crew, make the implausible plausible. That is a credit to their acting.

Peril, language in gloomy, character-driven apocalypse tale.

Summerland,77,73,audience,The child's innocence reminds me of My Girl
Summerland,77,73,audience,"Stunning scenery, pleasing plot, lovely period film ."
Summerland,77,73,audience,Like watching molasses through a sieve. Too sickening sweetsie piesie. Loads of long winded reaction shots and always yelling out for Frankie or Eddie or whoever else you want to put in a long shot. The swaying back and forth of the girl girl relationship omg just derobe them and throw them into bed  in the first five seconds why don't you. Oh dear I really hate being so negative in these difficult times. I have the luxury of sitting in a movie theatre here downunder. I was the only goon that paid for my ho hum time. The kids great actors & of course the mighty Tom who will be forever amazing. I did like the white cliffs and the beach scenes. I have never enjoyed watching actors act trying not to act. The bitch Alice a bit too bitchy and then of course she really turns into a sweet old 'gel' loved the token brown people. Being an ageing brown person trying to get work over the years in film TV and theatre always a challenge. A forgettable film but I always applaude writers who get their work on the big screen. I did stay to the end but it was only because Gizzie NZ 27° outside. Apologies if I have offended but I did enjoy the 40's costumes. Was looking for a cloche hat.
Summerland,77,73,audience,What a wonderful story great acting made me cry absolutely loved it .
Summerland,77,73,audience,This movie is not very good.  Reading some of the other reviews that loved it makes me think my DVD case must have contained a completely different movie. There's very little to like here. None of the various plot lines are explored - they are all superficial. I'd say more but there's little to comment on. It's just not worth 2 hours of anyone's time.
Summerland,77,73,audience,"Terrible, another H movie."
Summerland,77,73,audience,"I found the characters interesting and convincing. Overall, a nice film."
Summerland,77,73,audience,"Stunning, raw and real
Loved this movie in its entirety - such realistic expression of how we cope with the presentation of crisis in our lives - 100%  - good on you all"
Summerland,77,73,audience,"SUMMERLAND is a beautiful film as it explores the impact of war on children, the challenges of raising someone else's child, grief, sexuality, and more. Gemma Arterton is the backbone of this movie and her performance is outstanding — one of her best, I'd say. And Lucas Bond does a wonderful job of the child. And both of them have a genuine chemistry on screen that is delightful to watch. Their dialogues are believable and both of their characters are carefully developed so we empathise with them. The photography is beautiful. One of the better British films I've seen of late. Refreshing, charming, and uncompromising. And a nice twist at the end."
Summerland,77,73,audience,The twist is much too much
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
It's often a straightforward affair, but it also demonstrates that a feature can be neat, obvious, heartfelt and rivetingly acted all at once.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
Summerland is an auspicious debut for director Jessica Swale, one that shows her skills as both a storyteller and a filmmaker. It's a deeply personal film whose characters pop off the screen thanks to a great combination of writing and acting.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
It's the epitome of a comfort food period drama with characters that are easy to get attached to and beautiful views of the English coast.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
It's a story whose twists you can see coming a mile off, but that doesn't stop Summerland being a deeply satisfying watch.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
Made with great panache, this is a real gem of understated poignancy; about summers as lovely as they are fraught.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
Arterton towers in the role, not always in a good way. A stronger director might have reined her in, but Swale is not yet that experienced. When you add a large amount of treacle to the mix, the film becomes cloying and pushy.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
The child actors - Bond and Dixie Egerickx who plays a schoolfriend - are the most convincing elements of this woefully unconvincing romantic drama.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
As with any weepie there is a degree of contrivance involved in the story, but what matters is how well it is fashioned. Glad to say writer/director Jessica Swale knows how to hit the right beat at the right time.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
Summerland's lilting, soft-focus approach is part of its considerable appeal, but there is sharpness here too, where it counts.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
Despite its name (and July release date), Summerland  is a film for cozy times, bundled up in a sweater with a honeyed mug of tea cupped in hands.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
Summerland shows us how being robbed of self-expression - sexual or emotional - can feel like slow suffocation. But it's too afraid of uncertainty.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
May be a familiar destination at its core, but viewed through [Jessica] Swale's fresh eyes gives this trip a new lease of undiscovered territory.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
While Summerland possesses some period piece cliches, it still overcomes them with its storytelling verve and of course, its commendable performances.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
Summerland is sweet but fairly predictable. The English coast and countryside are gorgeous. And, the film's ending is uplifting and gratifying. All in all, the film is a little too lightweight, despite its excellent cast, but definitely enjoyable.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
[Director Jessica Swale] galvanizes her story about lost and forbidden love, as well as updating the mythical substrate with images that stylize and question the validity... of a story that supports current British identity. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
Swale is working towards a moral that is well-intentioned and progressive, but Summerland only understands these women as means to an easily predicted end.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
A luminous... romance, although, somewhat predictable. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
If you're the kind of gay who is as tired of melancholy endings as you are tragic endings, then trust that you'll be very pleased.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
...not the most original framing device, but Summerland isn't interested breaking all the rules.
 "
Summerland,77,73,critic,"
Summerland may not be the greatest show on Earth, but it is firmly Arterton's show - and deserves more attention than most anyone on these shores will likely give it.

Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,audience,Best Disney movie of all time? Possibly! Could be some recency bias because I haven’t seen a movie in imax in over a year but it certainly grabbed my interest instantly and the fun and surprises never let up! 
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,audience,Such a great movie with a wonderful message of unity! We loved this one!
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,audience,"Visually, this movie is stunning, which is to be expected from Disney. And while the world the movie takes place in is interesting, the plot is very cliche and there are WAY too many side characters to really become connected to any of them let alone develop them beyond surface level. I feel like this movie wanted to become the next Moana but Moana already perfected this genre, so this one feels less successful. Also, Awkwafina was just annoying and really took away from the world building (since you have a dragon using 21st century language/jokes in this mystical world)."
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,audience,"Full of a Disney's historical cliches, The last Air Bender storyline on this movie."
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,audience,¡Beautiful and fun story!
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,audience,"Childish, misleading 
Maybe only suitable for kids who are still in primary school 
However,  graphics are good"
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,audience,"Heartwarming story about the age old human themes of greed, jealousy and discord, with a clear message of what is needed to overcome. Humor throughout and delightful characters - loved it!"
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,audience,Really nice visuals and smooth effects. It's typical Disney characters but the world they've created is fresh. Overall it's a lot of fun.
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,audience,"Amazing, beautiful and soul caressing movie ❤ I specially loved Awkwafina as sisu ❤"

It's impossible to not be stunned by the beauty of the different scenes that Raya travels [to]. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
It's pure formula, but on the whole, it's a reasonably diverting family-friendly showcase for Disney's characteristic blend of humor, heart and artistry.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
However, even though the story arc presents nothing new, the messages within are delivered in unique ways by faces we don't frequently see. This is well worth noting, and these messages never get old.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
Certainly pitched well within the Disney formula - a princess-based tale of heroism - but it's also a monster step up in epic scale and action spectacle.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
Creating a better world is not a solo venture; it takes a village. Raya and the Last Dragon is freshly inclusive, lush and adventurous.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
Raya isn't groundbreaking; she's even better. Raya is the new norm.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
[I]ts tale of a young woman (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran) going on a quest is blandly formulaic, although the action scenes are lively.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
Raya's storyline is beat-for-beat, a traditional Disney story, but its nuances are what make it stand out.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
Unlike Disney's dreary live-action update of Mulan, the studio's latest animation epic Raya and the Last Dragon makes a virtue of its female-fronted cast of characters...
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
It's simplistic in its depiction of ""heroes"" and ""villains"" to the point where it feels more like a cheap Saturday morning cartoon than a rich animated feature.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
...merely serviceable...
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
The combination of action, drama, sentimentality and wackiness isn't always smooth, but the film looks so good, and the characters are so vivid, that it's easy to enjoy the ride.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
Albeit messy, Raya is a wonderment, most notably in its quieter observed moments that touch on grief, determination and companionship.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
""Raya and the Last Dragon"" has the laughs and tear-jerker moments we've come to expect and love but tries for more and succeeds on a supremely fun scale.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
A compelling enough story with well crafted, conceived and staged action sequences. Thematically, reminiscent of 'Star Trek' in that it's about a kind of future you want to believe in.

Raya and the Last Dragon might be conventional in its storytelling, but the stunning animation, lovely characters, beautiful music, and heartfelt messages won me over in the end.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
Raya and The Last Dragon provide spectacular performances from Kelly Marie Tran and Awkwafina, but will encourage conversations about trust, forgiveness, courage and fear,. Global leaders could take notes form this animated lesson for sure
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
It proves to be a joyful fantasy adventure.
 "
Raya and the Last Dragon,95,85,critic,"
The message is that you have to put aside differences and learn to trust and find common ground. It feels like it's hitting the right notes, with spectacular visuals.

My Zoe,63,,audience,"After trashing the sacrifices of motherhood in Before Midnight, Delpy celebrates the institution, albeit in a twisted, modern way that declares my body and my life are my own, even though I had nothing to do with bringing it into existence. Not up to her previous work."
My Zoe,63,,audience,"This was poorly executed and drowning in expository, dragging dialogue. We only saw it through to the end because we found the writing and Delphy's performance so ridiculously humorous. Made us in the mood to watch Tommy Wiseau's The Room! Shame!"
My Zoe,63,,audience,Love Julie Delpy from Before Sunrise etc and she apparently directed this family drama which has sci-fi elements. Bit of a tear-jerker be warned
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
Julie Delpy's intriguing My Zoe is an intimate and ambitious take on motherhood that mixes heart wrenching divorce drama, science fiction and thorny moral questions regarding reproduction.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
Brittle and clinical...
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
Something that feels almost like science fiction, but isn't.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
Intense drama has difficult adult themes, some language.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
The talented Julie Delpy misfires as director and star of a clumsy combo of domestic tragedy and sci-fi that comes to a maddening conclusion.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
... feels like two films crammed together, with the result more effective in its first half as a portrait of a fractured family navigating difficult circumstances.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
The love two people have for a child, no matter how difficult a divorce can be, what still remains is this beautiful creation. I loved My Zoe and it deserves to be discovered by all.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
The film isn't entirely a miss as Delpy gives an excellent leading performance and her direction is serviceable. But the story feels like it never wholly comes together.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
My Zoe dares to lead with its feelings, and that fearlessness provides a striking spectacle itself.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
Delpy's approach is patient and observant in its depiction of lingering grief, so the movie's second half ... comes ... as a disappointing anticlimax.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
[Delpy] proves to be a triple threat as the female lead, director and writer.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
Delpy tries something original with the writing, taking viewers on a different journey, exploring clouded decision-making abilities during an overwhelming time of sadness.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
This family drama from writer/director/star Julie Delpy is actually two different movies, each promising but incompatible.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
Delpy writes these characters with such depth, and stages their interactions with such sensitivity, that you understand them without necessarily approving of them.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
""My Zoe"" is well acted and well filmed, yes, but the storytelling, in which Delpy stitches together mismatched parts like a Dr. Frankenstein, is its weak suit.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
'My Zoe' is such a confused mess of pretension and anticlimax that it's hard to recommend as anything but a showcase of wasted potential.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
Delpy's film does what it sets out to do, which is show how deeply Isabelle loves Zoe. Again, that was never in doubt, and the actress' gutsy film and performance drive that obvious message home.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
Just when the drama seems too much to take, Delpy veers into unexpected, sci-fi- inflected territory and slyly refocuses our attention on the importance of remembering what matters in life.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
My Zoe is an ambitious family drama that goes to some unlikely and undercooked places, but it is hard to not admire the work from triple-threat Julie Delpy.
 "
My Zoe,63,,critic,"
Delpy sells it hard with her performance but the supporting cast are unconvincing, and the whole thing is a waste of everyone's time.

Cherry,37,74,audience,Best movie I saw all year. Very accurate depiction of PTSD and drug addiction within the frame of an artistic film.

Cherry,37,74,audience,"Beautifully acted and a compelling story however at times questionable direction, a near pointless voice over and a very slow second half dampen the experience of Cherry as a whole."
Cherry,37,74,audience,I loved this movie. Tom was amazing.
Cherry,37,74,audience,I actually didn't mind this movie at all. It had a good plot and was enjoyable to watch
Cherry,37,74,audience,"Good story, Good cast, Great performances by Holland and Bravo, Great Direction from the Russo brothers. It's only fault I can see is that it maybe runs 30 minutes too long."
Cherry,37,74,audience,Holland gives a great performance but I’m not sure the movie is totally aware of the seriousness of it’s own subject matter. Something about it felt overall off.
Cherry,37,74,audience,"Great performances by Tom and Ciara, but it's too long. Not boring, but too long and sometimes, less is more."
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
[A] flawed film, one that doesn't reach the heights of its obvious ambition...those flaws aren't enough to outweigh the quality performances and thoughtful aesthetic choices. It wins some battles, though perhaps not quite enough to win the war.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
Holland the heart and soul of the Russos' film, and even at just 24 years old, he shows he's got the chops to hoist the whole shebang onto his shoulders and carry it.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
Not perfect by any means, with many things wrong with it, but Tom Holland's performance pulls you through it, with the genre changing in each different section of his life.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
Casting is key, and this movie's biggest flaw. He's out of his element in the bigness of this role...the film is too showy with too many tricks, none of which work...
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
Young leads Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo make PTSD and drug abuse drama Cherry memorable.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
Rather than generating excitement, the insistence on momentum at all costs makes the film resemble an endless series of TV commercials strung together.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
You'll admire Holland's efforts here, but Cherry is a misfire as both drama and comedy.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
Cherry may look sugary and sweet, but don't let your Spidey senses fool you after seeing Tom Holland. He is not Peter Parker. This movie is a bitter pill that will make you wish that you reclaimed your time and never had the curiosity to sample it.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
Good movies have a runtime. Bad movies never end. Cherry is eternal.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
The main issue with Cherry is that it needed a more intimate style for its subject matter, and instead received the full blockbuster treatment.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
The result: all the shallowness of a superhero movie, but none of the fun.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
""Cherry"" is three movies in one, none of them fresh, all of them overlong.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
""Cherry"" is an over-directed near miss.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
""Cherry"" feels like the cinematic embodiment of the expression ""throw everything at the wall to see if it sticks.""
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
Irrefutable proof that the creative constraints of Kevin Feige and the MCU weren't, in fact, holding the Russos back. In fact, it seems unlikely the duo is capable of creating much value outside of its walled garden.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
Try as they might, the Russos' flashy filmmaking style can't mask the fact that ""Cherry"" lacks emotional heft while the story feels too distanced for its own good.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
The rot goes deeper than being ludicrously bloated and shapeless.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
A long winded, throw-the-kitchen sink epic that is more concerned with the next camera move than the next character move, but cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel does pull off some dazzling imagery...in the relationship between Cherry and the camera.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
Holland shows us, in one small scene, this movie's otherwise missing-in-action soul. But there's not much he can do about its tedium.
 "
Cherry,37,74,critic,"
The Russos sometimes succeed in delivering a visceral butt-kicker of a movie, but in its overall arc, Cherry feels an exclamation point on a tale that's been told before.

To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,audience,Cliché! Predictable! First one was better.
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,audience,I love the movie series. I want you to watch it.
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,audience,"As a fan of both the book series and the movies, I've enjoyed this final chapter a lot.
True to its source material and with satisfying endings."
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,audience,I thought the first one is better. It made me feel sleepy. Its just so so
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,audience,"The plotline is completely farfetched at this point and, IMO, this should've been one film, not a trilogy. This time it tried to get into some real topics on family relationships and coming of age life decisions, but the focus on the main character's relationship status is beyond annoying. It still shows a good effort on representation though."
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,audience,Definitely a movie worth watching if you're already invested in this trilogy. Lana Condor brings back every ounce of charm for a sweet and satisfying conclusion.
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,audience,"This film is not bad, but it's very boring. There was really no drama and even the small inklings of conflict were solved almost immediately."
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,audience,ahhhhhh; these movies are too cute & set standards way too high; i'm gonna go cry by myself now.
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,audience,"Non avevo la più pallida idea che appartenesse ad una effettiva trilogia, visto che l'ho scoperto solo a film finito. E' stata un'esperienza un po' cheesy e cento per cento americana, dove vengono seguite le principali linee guida per la classica commedia di fine liceo ambientata negli Stati Uniti. Nonostante questo, il film funziona. Funziona per la sintonia fantastica tra gli attori protagonisti, funziona per una sceneggiatura essenziale, leggermente sporcata da alcune convenienze, ma efficace, funziona per il tono generale che si riesce ad ottenere attraverso tutti gli aspetti tecnici. Mi ha piacevolmente sorpreso, un film tiepido ma funzionale che non ha fatto altro che mettermi di buon umore."
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,audience,"First of all amazing movie to watch during the night as i enjoyed it  with my cup of coffee. From starting out looks to be a mediocre sequel to the original turns out to be wonderful wrap and perhaps the best out of all the trilogy. It was 4/10 but as the movie progress it was definitely a 7/10, to me that says a lot about a movie as in between i was writing out notes longer than i expected. In short , this movie is recommended to everyone as you might discover new paths to your awakening during your adolescents as it holds to some beliefs that i have shared and hold on to. Since this is the first time for me to watch this it might seems bias so do take my opinion with context as i will watch again this again in the near future but as of now there are many things that makes this movie works. If you do not resonate with this film you might enjoy yourself some after we collided and kissing booth or maybe tall girl (jk these sucks)."
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,critic,"
As the series' conclusion, Always and Forever is a love letter in and of itself; not just to Lara Jean and Peter, but to Kitty and Dr. Covey, to rebellious Chris (and former mean girl Gen.

Some might call it saccharine or a self-serving ending, but Lara Jean and Peter have proven themselves to be stronger than the haters.
 "
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,critic,"
Components of Always and Forever are easy to indulge in while you're watching, but the film ultimately lacks the essential nutrients of a satisfying conclusion.

If Lara Jean wants to start writing her college chronicles, I'm completely down for a fourth, fifth, etc. installment.

Rom-com cinema gets a box-ticking new entry-cum-tribute that eagerly goes weak at the knees for the genre's fantasies.

A tasty, risk-free treat that's a little too sweet at times, but is full of heart and flavor and sprinkles.

Always and Forever's schmaltzy energy likely won't resonate outside of its target demographic.

Lara Jean is always delightful, but too many holes in the story left me frustrated. I wanted something better for Lara Jean. Will the teen crowd like it? Absolutely.

While I wanted more out of the film in regards to developing Lara Jean's sisterly bonds, To All The Boys: Always and Forever delivers a fantastic end to her high school years.

Like the latest dilemma it depicts, the franchise feels as if it has run its course, and it's time to move on.
 "
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,critic,"
Fans of the first two films already know they're going to watch this, at least out of curiosity, and it's wonderful to report that this Ben and Jerry's flavored trilogy ends on about as good a note as we can reasonably expect.
 "
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,critic,"
Frantic pacing and too much noise tarnish the gold in this last 'Boys.' Yet tender love scenes make us smile and entertain us for a while.

It's a comfort and a balm, the type of movie that makes you want to write love letters.

Always and Forever makes the frustrating mistake of not following through on the more bittersweet promises of its premise.
 "
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,critic,"
Condor holds down the emotional core of the movie, as always, and watching her embody Lara Jean through a massively transformative time in her life is as satisfying as it is bittersweet.

Lana Condor and Noah Centineo are as lovely and charismatic as ever as Lara Jean Covey and Peter Kavinsky in this final film of the rom-com trilogy.
 "
To All the Boys: Always and Forever,78,61,critic,"
Centineo and Condor remain the best part of Always and Forever, as they were the best part of P.S. I Still Love You... But like P.S. I Still Love You, Always and Forever fails to find strong, specific details in which to ground this love story.

Look Away,33,47,audience,"Love Is Blind on Netflix is a fetish-fest. Beautifully acted by the quirkiest of beautiful people, beautifully-filmed, set in a magically-real science based world of ""logic and reason."" Aesthetically-fetishy, architecturally-fetishy, archetypically-fetishy. Extremely male gaze. Extremely voyeuristic. Loved it."
Look Away,33,47,audience,"Did not like it over-all. Potrayed autism in a very bad light. And a woman should never want to be seen as anything more than a mother or if her kid is really 'sensitive', she will stop seeing you!?"
Look Away,33,47,audience,"The premise was a good one, but it just didn't work. I kept waiting for something to happen, any excitement whatsoever, and nothing. It was beautifully shot, but the script and pace made it unbearable."

I, Mr. Andre Locust Negro, found the LOVE IS BLIND Film to be an Interesting ""Chick Flick"" with a Bittersweet Ending.
•That is My Story, and I am Sticking to It•"
Look Away,33,47,audience,very shallow storytelling and characters acting in ways that make no sense to you.
Look Away,33,47,critic,"
It has interesting things to say about grief and relationships and good performances, but it fails to sell the audience on the romance.
 "
Look Away,33,47,critic,"
For a nothing of a movie, the vibe is pleasant and it's an easy enough sit-through.
 "
Look Away,33,47,critic,"
Shot by Whitebloom, ""Love Is Blind"" bursts with saturated colors and well-framed shots, but it's simply a layer of artifice that can't distract from the shoddy script.
 "
Look Away,33,47,critic,"
Love Is Blind is indeed the quirky romantic drama that the advertising suggests. ... In execution, however, it just doesn't fall into place in a manner befitting a clear and cohesive narrative.
 "
Look Away,33,47,critic,"
Unique and lovely, LOVE IS BLIND enchants us as one-of-a-kind. It opens your heart and your eyes. A romance film full of surprise
 "
Look Away,33,47,critic,"
Much too precious to be believed.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,audience,"A very poignant tale that makes you question what you'd do in their position. Everyone delivers a heartfelt performance, illustrating different examples of grief beautifully. The plot is loosely-structured and may annoy some viewers, but I think it is purposeful to allow the modest yet powerful performances shine."
The Farewell,98,87,audience,Laborious to watch. It has very little character development and the most dysfunctional group of men I have seen in a movie in ages.
The Farewell,98,87,audience,"It started out on a good note...and had promise, but the last 15-20 minutes got stranger and stranger.  In the end, and now that I'm done, I still have no idea what the take-home message is supposed to me.  Is there a moral?  Is there a message?  If so, it completed escaped me.  

Sorry, but all I can do is give this movie one star and wish I had the last two hours of my life back."
The Farewell,98,87,audience,Beautifully made. Authentic. It resonates.
The Farewell,98,87,audience,You can't watch this movie without finishing it with some minor change to your outlook on life. Life is a gift... And this movie was one to show it. It pulls at your heart with a ton of emotion while also giving subtle messages about culture and society.
The Farewell,98,87,audience,"RATING: A+  Director: Lulu Wang
The Farewell's story is utterly sad and at some points Hilarious at the same time. The film has a beautiful Cinematography and Akwafina is amazing as is the rest of the cast. I gotta say at some points I didn't know if I rather should laugh or cry. But Lulu Wang created something unique with this film, there will be many more amazing films in her career."
The Farewell,98,87,audience,"The strange and slow story of The Farewell is an important one, particularly a year after its release when so many are losing their loved ones.  Awkwafina as a person and character is aptly situated in the friction between two cultures and as a result her emotions feel fresh and genuine.  Many scenes such as the wedding photoshoot and the cemetery visit are strange in a lightly humorous way but like most of the scenes in the film, they fall a little flat.  From the onset the characters are all emotionally drained and the experience of watching The Farewell is a bit draining too.  The film is heartfelt but lacks vigor, and there are many touching moments but ultimately the film fails to come to life."
The Farewell,98,87,audience,"I love how films are becoming more representative of different human experiences--it's so more fun to watch these than the white male protagonist films of my youth! This is a perfect example of this. Fresh voice, fresh story."
The Farewell,98,87,audience,An interesting snapshot of a family moment
The Farewell,98,87,audience,"The film is a substantive work, unlike the shamelessly superficial ""Crazy Rich Asians."" Nora Lum, Awkwafina's real name, has superpowers of talent.  She's a rapper, comedian, writer and fabulous actress and for The Farewell she won the Golden Globe for Best Actress, Comedy or Musical. She has one hell of a sexy speaking voice, too."
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
No matter where you come from, you'll likely find some point of connection with The Farewell. The film's themes of love and loss resonate far beyond its Chinese location, thanks to a talented cast and deft writing and directing.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
Isn't this life? Nobody really knows, we just do the best we can.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
It is remarkable that Wang created this film...steeped in Chinese and Chinese-American culture and yet has a message so strong that it can appeal to wide audiences.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
A slow burn, a movie that builds to a poignant climax that not only feels earned but deserved.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
A profound meditation on young vs. old and East vs. West, [The Farewell] looks to bridge a generational and cultural divide...through reconciliation and understanding.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
It is exactly what it is, unapologetically. A funny, sweet, heart-felt, heart-wrenching film about family, identity, love and loss.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
Such an average, uneventful, small, intimately-designed, down-to-earth, slice-of-life drama that very little of it is memorable.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
The fact it's based on writer-director Lulu Wang's real life experiences only adds the poignancy.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
As authentic and involving as a family drama could hope to be, and one of the most effective takes on the tension between culture and identity seen in the last few years
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
The Farewell packs a powerful emotional punch while still offering plenty of humor to give it some levity.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
Wang has produced an utter marvel of a film. The Farewell is a beautiful, resonating gem, fuelled by some standout performances and told with touches of pure grace.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
It's about watching, about waiting. It's when it's at its most natural that The Farewell connects the inside and the outside with an honesty that's hard to resist.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
The second film as director of Lulu Wang doesn't move me nor does it seem funny, but I can't deny that it contains a certain intimacy with the intercultural treaty that describes the vicissitudes of a Chinese family. [Full review in Spanish]

""The Farewell"" will fill you with the same feeling as Yasujirô Ozu's Japanese masterpiece ""Tokyo Story."" You'll want to immediately pick up the phone, call your grandparents and tell them how much you love them.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
Injecting what is a tragic setup with comic elements requires a precarious balancing act from the filmmaker and star alike, but Wang and Awkwafina traverse the tightrope without a wobble.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
The Farewell becomes a gentle, universal plea that showcases all the perks and drawbacks of having a family.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
It's endearing and sad, but Wang's approach has a rather optimistic tone that serves perfectly with a fantastic cast. [Full review in Spanish].
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
A poignant look at cultural identity and its place in modern society.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
The Farewell may be a difficult sit for anyone who has lost a loved one, but it's a worthwhile one as it keenly captures the glorious awfulness and fabulous ridiculousness of family.
 "
The Farewell,98,87,critic,"
What The Farewell isolates so incisively is a sense of cultural melancholia specific to the immigrant experience, a mourning for something lost in the process of existing between worlds.

The Gentlemen,75,84,audience,"Love the sequencing and manner the story is presented.  Good acting, good plot and good fun."
The Gentlemen,75,84,audience,"Solid Guy Ritchie movie nothing more, nothing less."
The Gentlemen,75,84,audience,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I particularly liked the relationship between Mickey and his wife.  I would definitely watch a sequel, if made.  All the stars were top notch. Loved smarmy Hugh Grant!  Far jump from Daniel Cleaver!  Highest marks."
The Gentlemen,75,84,audience,"Guy Ritchie is back to his old tricks and this film is more in the vein of LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS and SNATCH. However, compared to those, this film desperately tries to recreate the magic of those films but fails in its attempt. As Ritchie is known for, many characters to introduce at the beginning, followed by a lot of misdirection before the final reveal. While it has an impressive cast and McConaughey star shines the brightest, the film was too loquacious for me. Most of the film is told from Hugh Grants POV, who plays an investigative journalist, who's blackmailing McConaughey via his right hand man, Ray (played by Charlie Hunnam). The film will either grip you or leave you bored. And while I wasn't entirely bored, I was somewhat ready for the credits to roll earlier than I would have wished."
The Gentlemen,75,84,audience,"I just can't with movies like this, Snatch, Layer Cake, etc.  I don't know if they're good, or bad, or what... it's like they make a movie I would like but then they do something in the editing room and I don't know what I am watching.  Do they just send different edited versions to different audiences and is that why I don't see what I think I'm going to see or what other reviewers suggest they saw?"
The Gentlemen,75,84,audience,"Guy Ritchie does wonders with this riveting, clever tale of a flamboyant drug criminal underground. It's stylish and exceedingly fun with a colorful cast of characters portrayed by a foray of skilled high profile actors. 

I regret not being able to catch this film in theaters, just a entertaining ride thru and thru"
The Gentlemen,75,84,audience,"It has its moments. Great cast, I've never been a huge Guy Ritchie fan though. I found this movie to be very forgettable"
The Gentlemen,75,84,audience,"Hilarious, and very riveting. Sometimes a little hard to follow what's real and what isn't, but that doesn't make the movie any less fun."
The Gentlemen,75,84,audience,"Ritchie's best work in a long time, if not THE best he's ever done. Everything from the dialogue, to the editing and the wild set pieces pop, helping to balance out some of the more outlandish elements. Small nit-picks aside, it's pure fun, so strap in and enjoy!"
The Gentlemen,75,84,audience,Like how they put this together Mickey Pearson was ruthless
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
Like the vast majority of Ritchie's work, The Gentlemen is both entertaining and almost instantly forgettable
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
The cast is top notch and everyone is on their A-game, and it gives more fodder for Sons of Anarchy fans to boast about what Hunnam can do when he's directed well.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
The Gentlemen is easily Ritchie's best movie in years. Each of the actors, from the big stars to the bit players, is a joy to watch, and they bring the story to life even when the plot mechanics threaten to drive it into a ditch.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
London underworld story, Guy Ritchie style, but with maturity and Hollywood faces to reward the two decades experience.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
Sometimes, The Gentlemen gives the impression that Ritchie doesn't consider this a return to form so much as an insistence that no number of flops would dare issue him a comeuppance.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
But it feels sloppily made without a coherent tone and while there are some great performances, they don't entirely work next to each other.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
As rock 'n rolling as the filmmaking is, the story acts as an anchor, bogging things down as it gets more and more convoluted.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
The Gentlemen is a crisp and comedic action entertainer with fascinating characters.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
Guy Ritchie returns to his British crime caper roots with this fun but disposable bit of malarky.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
This is not a bad crime drama, it's an awful one.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
Cool, snappy, fun and stupidly entertaining, this is evidence of a director flexing his established genre muscles and allowing himself to have a bit of fun once more.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
Yes, Ritchie's been down this narrative road before but his approach in realizing it on screen is far less manic and self-conscious, making for a far mature, grounded work than his previous efforts
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
Leaving aside the story about the marijuana boss played by Matthew McConaughey (love u), I want to focus on Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell. Both are superb, eclipsing the rest of the cast and, at times, the film itself. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
The Gentlemen does amuse at times thanks to the efforts of the cast. It is too bad that it adds up to less than the sum of its parts due to its aggressive self-referential attitude and its blatant racism.

The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
I never imagined this filme would have so much to do with the art of storytelling. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
The Gentlemen tries to be a little too clever for its own good, but if you're curious to see [Guy] Ritchie's take on a backstabbing criminal subculture, then The Gentlemen might be your stinging cup of tea.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
Guy Ritchie is back in his wheelhouse, spinning tales about flawed yet addicting criminals trying to outwit the next bad guy on the block. The cast is perfectly assembled.
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
Class meets crass in Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen . This film goes down like a good bourbon: smooth, expensive-feeling, and when it burns, it burns good. It's refined but feels a little dirty, like taking a joyride in a Porsche
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
I am very glad to see 'The Gentlemen', because it's a film in which Ritchie finally returns to the style that characterizes him. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Gentlemen,75,84,critic,"
With Guy Ritchie behind the screenplay and in the director's chair, it's not surprising that there are enough twists and turns to fill a hedge maze.

Mr. Jones,85,,audience,An excellent examination of a significant historical event.
Mr. Jones,85,,audience,"Media on the Holodomor is yet rare and unpopular. This movie is a great introduction to the younger generation, especially those who have read Orwell in school and are not aware of the historical context of his works. This is my favorite movie."
Mr. Jones,85,,audience,One of 2020's strongest offerings.  4.25/5
Mr. Jones,85,,audience,"Mr. Jones should be required viewing for every American. It's a gripping historical thriller that tells the story of Stalin's Soviet Union man-made famine, also known as the Holodomor. This is through the lens of Gareth Jones, a Welsh journalist who traveled to Ukraine to see it for himself and then was the first to report it under his real name and without equivocation. Estimates vary between 3 to 12 million were killed in the span of two years. The film should also remind us of how the Moscow editor of one of our own newspapers (The New York Times) covered it up."
Mr. Jones,85,,audience,Riveting period thriller set in 1930s USSR about the Red Terror and Famine. Provides high drama and important perspective.
Mr. Jones,85,,audience,"Despite its brutal honesty about the horrors of communism, Agnieszka Holland's treatment fails to conjure the spirited emotion necessary to make the story of Gareth Jones come alive. What's left is a cold, drab depiction of the uncovering of the Holodomor and Walter Duranty's complicity in its coverup."
Mr. Jones,85,,audience,An interesting but underdeveloped George Orwell sub-plot is one of the only deficits in this otherwise compelling period piece about the journalistic search for truth and the cost of utopian vision under Stalin's communist regime.
Mr. Jones,85,,audience,"The appearance of Orwell, both in the prologue sequence and then again periodically throughout the narrative, is a bit heavy handed and unnecessary. Outside of that this is still one of the stronger films about journalists witnessing historical atrocities. It lacks the self-righteousness these kinds of movies often have, often focusing on the ways in which members of the media can deliberately obscure the facts in favor of their own ideology just as often as they can expose the truth."
Mr. Jones,85,,audience,A bit muted in impact but a fascinating history shines through.
Mr. Jones,85,,audience,"Good acting, fair script. Skipped some elements..."
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
Agnieszka Holland is directing the heck out of this. But she's directing to compensate for the script, not to augment or accentuate it.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
Jones's story has been largely forgotten, so it's commendable that this film is bringing it back to the forefront.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
Despite some slack pacing Mr. Jones is an absorbing history lesson with a timely message for today. It's a rejection of fake news and those who belittle the life-saving value of journalism.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
An effective and harrowing period drama, one that you may struggle to shake off for some time.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
A powerful story of a horrific crime rarely told on screen. Brilliantly-directed from a solid script that feels personal, featuring a compelling performance from James Norton that made you invested in Jones' journey right from the start.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
Perhaps in the 1990s, MR. JONES would have gained some mild attention from Academy voters for telling a dark story with just the right amount of frankness and Hollywood sheen.

This powerful depiction of that journey and its muddy political consequences spurs some of Holland's best work ever, with Jones' excursion into a countryside of frozen corpses assuming the tenor of a surreal nightmare.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
A biographical thriller that has an intriguing opening capturing the political paranoia of the period, but unfortunately loses its pulse when it reiterates the manichean discourse on the fallacies of a regime. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
Mr. Jones is thrilling, sad and above all, well acted.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
Powerful messages here. Messages which are important to hear today. At all times.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
A well-made, uneven film...[with]top-notch performances, particularly from Peter Sarsgaard who brilliantly captures Duranty's complicated personality, certainly make it a satisfying watch.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
While the battle for the necessity of clear-eyed journalism has never seemed more fraught, Agnieszka Holland's no-nonsense ""Mr. Jones"" is a timely reminder that this push-and-pull between reporters and political power is as old as the printing press.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
Mr. Jones is a worthy addition to the canon.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
For all the horror, Mr. Jones is ultimately an uplifting film. The fact that producers made it at all, with such an impressive cast, is something of a minor miracle.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
[An] engrossing, intelligent, visually gripping film from director Agnieszka Holland, working from a well-researched script by Andrea Chalupa.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
Holland films Mr. Jones with the same humanistic approach she takes in her World War II drama Europa, Europa. The director captures the subtle emotions of every major and minor character and then sets them against chilling political backdrops.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
The tremendously interesting and subtle screenplay from Andrea Chalupa asks larger and more complicated questions than: Why did Stalin starve the Ukraine? Mr. Jones is more interested in the complicity of the West.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
While there are genuinely moving moments peppered throughout Mr. Jones, the overall film is frustratingly inconsistent, and fails to fulfill the potential of its extraordinary source material.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
The starkness of this oft-forgotten period of history is not diminished by its stylistic portrayal. Indeed, it only further emphasizes the brutality of what millions of Ukrainians were forced to live through and the importance of bearing witness to it.
 "
Mr. Jones,85,,critic,"
It's an important and compelling story, but oddly bloodless in the telling.

Onward,88,95,audience,"Uma história fofa e divertida, com protagonistas super divertidos, com vários artifícios super criativos, mas que ainda assim a gente conheça, e com um final emocionante."
Onward,88,95,audience,"This film is very good for me, it explores a story that is very interesting and that entertained every second, the end is very sad and if I leave myself reflecting so I can make the most of it with my family. I feel that the way in which they try to recover the Pope is well achieved since it does not feel forced at all, the voice of Tom Holland and Chris Pratt feels natural and fresh, well if it suits their characters."
Onward,88,95,audience,"Beautiful movie, must see"
Onward,88,95,audience,"""Onward"" is a decent film with immense creativity, but the repetitive and forgettable story, and some annoying characters."
Onward,88,95,audience,"Another hit for Disney, funny, unique world building, relatable and mature characters and a unforgettable story. Onward isnt for everyone, but the messages it leaves at the end of the film is sure to warm anyones heart."
Onward,88,95,audience,Perfectly funny and a heartwarming story. Pixar really knows how to make heartwarming storys. Grade: B+
Onward,88,95,audience,"Pixar's most underrated movie is Onward, despite the slow pacing in the story"
Onward,88,95,audience,A heartwarming tale of growing up and coming to terms with your choices of the past. A cute adventure with relatable characters and a fantasy meets modern times feel I love.
Onward,88,95,audience,"It's funny, all sorts of nerdy, but also heartfelt and emotional. I was invested the whole time. The characters are really the heart of this story - The relationships in this movie seem very ""real,"" despite that fact that they're elves (and other creatures). No one comes off as extremely stereotypical. They might seem a certain way on the outside, but as you get to know them throughout the movie they seem more complex."
Onward,88,95,audience,"Beautifully Animated and Hilarious, This Is The Pinnacle of Pixar"
Onward,88,95,critic,"
A very nicely crafted story that pays off on seemingly every little thing it sets up, a steady stream of laughs and endearing voice performances.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
That Pixar magic, that sprinkling of Pixar dust... makes Onward as spellbinding as it is enriching.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
While perhaps not a top-tier Pixar release, Onward is still head and shoulders above most other animated fare. It delivers the emotional release it promises in its premise in a slightly unexpected way, something that makes up for whatever it lacks.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
[I]t's a touching tale of brotherly love that deals with grief, learning to believe in yourself, and the awkwardness of your teenage years.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
What it lacks in storytelling innovation it makes up for in heart. The movie's strength is in the way it handles the somber subject matter - the loss of Ian and Barley's father - in the context of an exciting adventure filled with optimism.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
If you can hold fast through its plodding fantasy clichés, there won't be a dry eye in the room.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
Pixar has the uncanny ability to take ridiculous storylines that, on paper, seem too outlandish to work and humanize them through detail, wit and the wizardry of animation. Onward is a sweet, heartfelt ode to brotherly love.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
I cried like a baby at the ending. I like this film. That said... Pixar films have a very unnerving obsession with the concept that some people are inherently special, and that the democratization of ability is corrupting.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
The characters are well built, animation is outstanding and it has a tenderness that shows how Pixar, even when it's not excellent, gets to the heart. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
Despite...superbly rendered (but not particularly imaginative), ultra-realistic animation, Onward is arguably the weakest Pixar release since the Cars sequels.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
Onward manages to take its dialogue and have it push you to tears. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
It's a jagged narrative that doesn't flow smoothly from scene-to-scene.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
Onward might not quite hit the zenith of the gargantuan Pixar mountain, but it's just one more burst of gas away from that sky-high summit.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
Predictable but not compliant, I really liked the the feeling of satisfaction controversy the ending brings. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
A truly magical end product.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
A fantastic, original premise, but... I do feel like I've seen similar adventures from other studios... Regardless, with Pixar putting their own spin on it... you simply forgive its few flaws thanks to the heart and soul of the story and its characters.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
Your enjoyment will hinge on whether you can get past the concept of a deceased father's severed body bouncing around screen. Thankfully, it's played for comedy, not morbidity.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
The visual effects in ""Onward"" are perfectly fine and much better than most animated films. But compared to other Pixar movies ... Onward is on the lower end of the quality scale.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
Tom Holland and Chris Pratt make for a killer combo in Pixar's latest tear-jerking animation that will have you ugly crying.
 "
Onward,88,95,critic,"
I wouldn't say Onward is a mediocre to poor film, but I wouldn't label it as an instant classic either. It's a pleasant and most of the time enjoyable romp.
 "
Bombshells and Dollies,,,critic,"
It's a great watch simply to appreciate how this group of women have found something that makes them feel empowered and beautiful.
 "
Bombshells and Dollies,,,critic,"
Bombshells and Dollies may not entirely convert people who judge the Pin-Up lifestyle at face value, but it shows how much fun and confidence it gives the people who indulge in the lifestyle...
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,audience,"Although the premise of 'The Virgin Suicides' is disturbing, the film itself is not, because it doesn't take itself too seriously despite the subject matter. However, I felt unsatisfied by the end, because I guess I was hoping for more context...a sensible explanation. But maybe that's the whole point of the film?"
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,audience,"Sofia Coppola directed this movie with some very beautiful shots really mesmerizing, the plot although a bit Hollywood it serves as a message of teenagehood that is true today as it was during the time of the movie and before."
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,audience,"I rate this for being weird and unique but still entertaining whilst daring to inject humour into such a morbid topic. There's a bit of everything in this film. Whilst it's about a serious topic I can't take the film seriously and I'm not sure I'm even meant to. Either way, I enjoyed it whilst it lasted."
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,audience,"I don't understand why so many gave this such a high rating. Not that it's a bad film, just not exceptional. Just a coming of age film witb a quirky twist. One thing for sure, if the girls were imprisoned like that today, child services would make a visit. What are the chances of an entire family, sans the mom and dad, comitting suicide? Hell, i was depressed just watching them cooked up all day, never mind living like that. Life is can get depressing enough, why subject yourself to something like this in a film. Meh ..."
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,audience,"too slow and strange for me,but I could see how people like it"
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,audience,"This movie looks great and was a starmaker, but I didn't like it when it first came out and there's so much I dislike now.

First: if the parents are so vanilla and bland, why did they name a daughter ""Lux?"" It sounds like they wanted boys to take a ride in their daughter.

How did the parents not hear anyone running around in their house?

This film is showy -- it looks great! The substance is really lacking: we spend a lot of time listening to the boys but none learning of their individual secrets. We never learn squat about the parents."
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,audience,Strange film. Like a teenage dream. My reading of it is that the parents were psychopaths and the girls too. Psychopaths are mostly happy when they kill. Which is somewhat what happened.
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,audience,Really good and nervewrecking
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,audience,"Whilst its way of exploring its main subject is both pretentious and perfunctory, Sofia Coppola's nuanced and sensitive direction conveyed almost everything the screenplay aspired, yet failed, to do. Plus, the soundtrack of this film has I'm Not in Love: I think this is everything a film of this kind needed to be great!

(8/10)"
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,audience,"Haunting and powerful. It shows off just how brilliant Coppola was growing to be. A coming of age teen angst story, that doesn't quite end as cleanly as most. It's tragic, dreamy and leaves a lot for you to chew on."
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
But the film's core has much more to say about how someone's suicide is perceived and remembered by society as a whole than about the act of suicide itself.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
Sofia Coppola's directorial debut is a dark, gauzy adaptation...The laconic style of the film purposefully and poetically echoes the emotionally troubled tide that grips the sisters.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
By the end, The Virgin Suicides is a rare thing, an anti-coming-of-age movie.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
A uniquely unforgettable movie experience.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
The Virgin Suicides offers a glimpse into the murky unknowability of adolescence, and its legacy is tied to the portraits of femininity with which Sofia Coppola has crafted her filmography.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
A brilliant external commentary on patriarchy, affluence and homogeneity, as well as an experiential ode to the intangibles and inherent mysteries of the human condition.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
A surprisingly intricate struggle with absence, grief, and memory.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
Intense, imperfect movie about teen suicide.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
Sofia Coppola's compelling, ethereal fable about adolescent loss of innocence is claustrophobic and uncomfortable, but profoundly affecting and gently funny. ""The Virgin Suicides"" advises teen years are sometimes best remembered as a long-ago vacation.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
Sofia Coppola's adaptation of Jeffery Eugenides' 1993 novel plays like a sweet, sad dream.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
It's yet another case of blame-the-parents, and, more precisely, blame-the-overprotective-mother.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
Sofia Coppola tackles the issue of teenage suicide with an assured treatment in The Virgin Suicides, effectively employing a seriocomic tone.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
A very curious and eclectic piece of work.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
An assured feature debut, this darkly humorous exploration of a tough subject benefits from an original narrative and the fact that the appealing cast consists of actors who are the same age as the characters they play.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
The strongest directorial debut of the year.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
The tone of wistful regret and longing doesn't preclude a good deal of gentle humour. It's a restrained, subtly suggestive piece which disintegrates if you try to get a fix on it.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
A rather stunted and sliggish exercise in style whose sporadically haunting visual quality doesn't make up for its shallowness and ponderous pace.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
A stellar debut feature from Sofia Coppola and it's a must see.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
Concentration on either the writing or the direction, but not both, may have spawned a better film from first-timer Sofia C.
 "
The Virgin Suicides,77,81,critic,"
Mergulhando com sensibilidade na amargura do universo adolescente, com seus anseios e frustraes, Coppola estria de forma memorvel na direo.

Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,audience,"Not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but not as good or raw (when it comes to singing) as the first film.
As a stand alone it would have been ok, but following the joyous first film it was always going to struggle somewhat for me.
Lily James isn't bad at all, indeed for me she is so much better than Amanda Seyfried, but this is balanced by the superfluous arrival of Cher at the end of the film, and who's appearance suggests that the film makers were desperate to attract viewers by the addition of a big name (and knowing that this film isn't as good as the first)
Should you watch it?
Yes if you have nothing else to watch on a miserable and wet winters afternoon, but otherwise I'd give it a miss.
That's not saying it's bad, it's just not as good as it could have been...."
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,audience,"If I could fast forward half of the movie and only watch the parts with Lily James (the prequel parts) it would be a good movie. The problem is the recycled songs, lack of Meryl Streep, and the stiltedness of the reopening plot. The parts of the sequel plot seem forced and the choreography is just bad. It makes the My Big Fat Greek Wedding seem like an Oscar contender. The prequel parts with Lily James and Co are great, just fast forward to the end to see Meryl Streep in Donna glory (it's a blast)."
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,audience,"With more humour, more emotion, more ABBA hits and more glitter, this sequel is a joy to witness! Managing to outshine its predecessor, this fun musical will have you laughing and singing along the whole way through."
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,audience,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was entertaining. However, aspects such as the plot and the fact that they used every single opportunity to just shove an extra song in there is what makes this movie suffer. It builds on us already having a connection with the characters, so it fails to give us a reason to care about them. All the characters were pretty stagnate and didn't show any development. The scene in which the grandma sings would have been amazing, if not for the fact that the viewer knows nothing about her therefor doesn't care. Overall, the film was entertaining and passed the time but failed to give us a reason as to why we should care."
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,audience,"Having seen this musical several times since its opening (and once again just now on a TV broadcast, complete with jarring commercial breaks) I find it gets even better with age.  It's definitely primarily for those of us who love all-stops-out, unapologetic movie musicals (thankfully with no attempts at hiding or apologizing for it being a movie musical to try and lure non-musical fans).  I'll add it's also for movie musical fans who may not be fans of ABBA's music, which is the primary reason this sequel and the original ""Mamma Mia"" musical even exist:  I'm a casual listener to their many hits over the years, not a big fan, and this film uses their music so well I discovered a newfound appreciation for the bubbly, and at times quietly lilting, nature of much of it, enjoying it more than I ever have.  Most all of the musical numbers are filmed beautifully, made to look visually glowing and using the breathtaking on-location surroundings incredibly well (I'm guessing this film inspired quite a bit of travel to this particular island off the coast of Croatia, which stood in for the Greek island used in the first film), with genuine zest and amusingly creative touches, and with one of the most lively and committed cast of dozens of fluidly-choreographed extras wildly singing and dancing with the principals I've ever seen in any musical.  (You know how you can sometimes glance at a background extra and notice they're bored, unengaged, or even grandstanding for the camera?  I've yet to see even one extra doing that in this film, even after multiple viewings.)  Everyone looks like they're having a ball, from the stars to the tiniest roles, there are some truly funny and talented small-part actors featured in standout moments, which I always love to discover in a film, and it completely caught me up once again, even with those frustrating TV commercial breaks stopping the action dead every 15 minutes or so on this particular viewing.  I laughed, tapped my foot, swayed with the music when prompted by the cast, hummed along with the songs I knew, joyously teared-up during the several sentimental, touching moments, and love the way the whole thing's tied up at the end with one of the best (and glitziest and goofiest) closing-credits set of scenes ever:  Colin Firth's first reaction to his over-the-top credit-sequence costume, as only one example, made me laugh out loud.  Kudos to all involved--and I mean everyone, especially the director and anyone else onboard who managed to keep so many actors looking so rapturous and sunny throughout filming (we all know how much time actually elapsed in real time between those big dance numbers).  I would've liked to have seen a ""making of"" documentary focused on how the biggest dance/song numbers were staged, especially the one with the fleet of boats with dozens of extras on each one dancing and singing in perfect synch.  To all of you:  Your work and unflagging upbeat energy in making the film sure did successfully shine through!  Congratulations, and thank you.  It's been a rough period of time (I'm writing this during the COVID-19 pandemic, and now the added unrest in Washington, D.C.) and your film was a welcome escape from all of it for a couple of hours."
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,audience,"Wayyy Better Than The First!!!!!
A brilliant feel good film with much better singing, much more comedy and excellent dancing. Julie Walters and Christine Barankski get a lot more to do and altogether it is amazing!! Definitely 5 stars and I definitely recommend it, even to those who hated the first. Absolutely brilliant Escapism Fun."
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,audience,"It is a nonesense story but when the music kicks in you can't help but feel joy.

As enjoyable as the first one, unnecessary but they didn't screw it."
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,audience,"Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again (2018) is an amazing romantic comedy / film, with a very creative and well-crafted story, with a strong humor, and fun and clean jokes. My grade is 10/10."
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,audience,Such a good movie with classic songs by Abba 
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,audience,"First off, this movie is EXCEEDINGLY better than the first Mamma Mia! in 2008. However, even though the plot is stronger than the first, overall it's still pretty weak. The numbers were twice as fun as the first and Lily James just glows throughout the whole film. Totally a must-watch for ABBA fans and those who were fans of the original looking for a good time, with a little tear-jerker at the end :)"

The movie is a significant improvement on its predecessor. Then again, it's difficult to state just how incompetently made the first movie is.

ABBA. Sequins. Cher. You can't go wrong.

Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again should once again get fans standing in the aisles, dancing and singing along to their favourite hits and having a blast with a charming cast.

As a prequel dressed as a sequel, it's too much and not enough.
 "
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,critic,"
Utterly ludicrous, joyously fun and has an emotional arc which will stick in the back of your throat. If you are expecting that all glittery, spandex-wearing cast number you will not be disappointed with copious amounts of laughter bringing you to tears.

Better than the first, but not by much.

Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,critic,"
In Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, things just kind of happen to provide excuses to sing listlessly. These renditions are so flat and lifeless, they make the original versions sound raw and edgy.
 "
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,critic,"
Sequels generally are diminishing in returns, but this one seems like such a shadow of the first. Waiting 10 years did it no favors. Most of it feels old, tired, and very ""been there, done that.""

Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again blends kitsch and nostalgia delightfully, dressing it up in Greek shades of white and blue and vivid '70s style.

Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again outshines the original in virtually every department, with better singing, better dancing, and better humor.

Songs were the strength of Mamma Mia in 2008, they are doubly so now. So take two hours of your life to sing your heart out and watch beautiful people in sunny places. Escape.
 "
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,critic,"
It isn't until Cher's arrival on the island that the film becomes the kooky, campy free-for-all that it always should have been.
 "
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,79,65,critic,"
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, like its predecessor, is silly from start to finish. It is goofy and predictable and kitschy and absurd. It is also wonderful.

Hanna,71,66,audience,Just a very good action movie with a simple yet fun premise. Saoirse Ronan is her usual great self and there's just enough kickass action in this to keep you engaged.
Hanna,71,66,audience,"Action adventure, coming-of-age, some fitting comedic elements - this film delivers on many levels not the least of which is remarkable work from Ronan , Blanchett and Bana"
Hanna,71,66,audience,"While I was saddened by how the movie ended with me asking a lot of questions, despite the solid book-ends and had a feeling this wasn't the best movie it could've been, Hanna is definitely a more notable action thriller. There are great performances, well-choreographed action sequences, equally thrilling chase scenes, a few legitimately funny moments and a great score that the movie would fare worse without. But what really makes this well-shot movie stand out is its unique take on the ""coming-of-age"" subgenre through the eyes of a girl trained to be the perfect assassin. While I'm not sure how well I can go into detail about it, my point is that Hanna does have more on its mind than being Lady Bourne (no pun intended). I may not love this movie but I was definitely on board all the way through with what the director intended to make."
Hanna,71,66,audience,"Story/Screenplay: (3.5/5) Super soldier films are not uncommon, but make the super soldier a teenage girl and you've got something more rare.  Doing it well is even rarer.

Duration/Tempo: (3.5/5) At 1 hour and 51 minutes, it's an average length movie that felt short to average in length.  The steady and well timed changes in scenes and settings probably contributed towards the feel that the film was moving forward and faster than it actually was.

Cast & Crew: (4.5/5) Saoirse Ronan was outstanding.  One of the better performances I've seen from a teen actor.  Excellent support from Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett.

Summary: (3.5/5) The story was good, the cast was excellent, and the film didn't feel long.  A thumbs up."
Hanna,71,66,audience,"An arthouse action film that never becomes pretentious. Hanna is a fun and exciting action thriller delivering strong performances, thrilling action scenes and a cool soundtrack "
Hanna,71,66,audience,"Hanna was a great action movie with good cast of characters well directed by Wright. I could have given 5 stars if not for totally annoying music by The Chemical Brothers, bad decision on using them for music."
Hanna,71,66,audience,"Grande cast e duello al femminile a suon di fughe e combattimenti.
Rimangono abbastanza oscure le motivazioni che spingono tutti i personaggi.
godibile ma non ho provato particolare empatia, Cate Blanchett non mi è sembrata particolarmente interessante come villain."
Hanna,71,66,audience,Saoirse Ronan is great in what is an implausible plot but still this is a fun action film
Hanna,71,66,audience,Incredible story with the intrepid Saoirse Ronan leading the ensemble on the journey into super agent status. Incredible fight sequences put this film in the category of superb.  Also Cate Blanchett as the villain is quite the curve ball. Highly recommended for an enjoyable film. Check it out!
Hanna,71,66,audience,"This movie, is so underrated, more people need to see it, it's not just an action movie, it's suspense too, when i first saw it, I clapped when it ended. FANTASTIC"
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
Perhaps Hanna is a good film because the action is part of the narrative rather than the narrative being a part of the action.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
Even though there are misogynistic undercurrents to the fatal gunshot wound Hanna delivers... Weigler will never die because she lives on in Hanna, and her story will be retold and revised just like the fables women and girls pass on to one another.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
Tries so hard to be edgy and different that desperation trumps the minor intrigue brought about by bizarre characters and situations.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
Never quite gels into a cohesive cinematic experience and is, far too often, simply boring.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
We walk out of it with more questions than anything else, which can sometimes be a film's strength ... but that's not the case here.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
Ostensibly a thriller about a teenage assassin, Hanna reveals itself to be a fairytale with a modern twist.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
A unique, often strange take on both an action film and a growing-up story
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
Explosive, intense, heart pounding, riveting, pulsating...and these are just a few of the adjectives to describe Hanna.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
It's one hell of a letdown.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
A sleek, willfully preposterous action movie...This is a rare action movie where women rule.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
The deeper the story gets, the more convoluted and preposterous it becomes. Still, ""Hanna"" is a lot of fun, thanks to Ronan and two great action sequences.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
The thing with Joe Wright's beautifully shot movie is that it never really feels true.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
Overall, Saoirse Ronan is a marvelous, powerful actress and Hanna is a great character. Perhaps a sequel to the film Hanna will have a script worthier of both.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
Hanna is a pulse-pounding, lethal fairy-tale actioner.

Hanna,71,66,critic,"
The soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers is outstanding. It makes the film look rather like a series of music videos, but so well shot and energetic, the viewer doesn't really mind.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
A dark, twisted fairy tale. 'I just missed your heart,' Hanna says to an elk she shoots at the beginning of the film. The film itself, however, is almost right on target.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
A perfect package of pulsating chills and pulpy thrills.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
Beautifully shot sequences and little character moments kept me leaning forward in excitement.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
When a storyline is this flat, the characters need to be all the more engaging and Hanna fails in this regard.
 "
Hanna,71,66,critic,"
Hanna wouldn't have been convincing with any other star in the title role.

Girlhood,96,73,audience,Excellent movie. Highly recommend. I thought it depicted very well the life in some of the suburbs around Paris.
Girlhood,96,73,audience,"A beautiful, brilliant, moving study of a teenage girl in the Paris projects discovering herself, the city, and the complexity of relationships. At times the film is a little self-consciously staged - and this works beautifully as if to emphasise the universal aspects of these very personal experiences. Music is important, punctuating the film at times close to a sense of the musical numbers of musical theatre; in particular is one scene, as the girls dance and sing along to Rhianna's 'Diamonds' in stolen dresses in a hotel room. It's a beautifully conceived, staged and played scene that is allowed to run the length of the song - a moment of care-free self-identification for the girls without the world's prying eyes to shape them into something other. This latter trap is one the central character repeatedly is drawn to and burned by throughout the film, the periodic briefly extended black screens functioning as marker points for something akin to scene changes as she discovers something new, more dangerous or significant than before. The ending manages to combine deep sadness and some kind of grounded hope against the expanse of the city, Marieme's internal struggle for identity continuing to be played out on a scale at once epic and intimate. An essential and masterful film."
Girlhood,96,73,audience,"Impeccably paced and directed, well shot, and very naturally acted coming-of-age story. Lead Karidja Touré turns in an amazing and impressively nuanced performance."
Girlhood,96,73,audience,Niet zo speciaal als verwacht
Girlhood,96,73,audience,"The appeal here isn't in presenting a story that's never been told before, but taking a common story and doing an excellent job at telling it. And once again, like all Céline Sciamma films, we're treated to some world class casting."
Girlhood,96,73,audience,"This film had great potential; however, it is so drawn out it gets tiring to watch. I had to take several breaks to get through it; boring would be a compliment. An hour-long movie was all that was needed to convey the message or if there really was one. Probably rates as one of the worse movies I've seen in a while, sadly."
Girlhood,96,73,audience,"- Black skin and poverty can really f@ck with Girlhood -

At first look, things can be misleading.

I didn't do any reading about Girlhood before sitting down to watch it.  The poster grabbed my attention.  It's of a beautiful, young, black girl and it's not something I see that often.  I was into it.  

In the opening scene, I settled in to watch a montage of an American football game, which is fine-great even. Then as the scene played out, I realized it was women playing football-not soccer, not futbol, but football. Next I realized I hadn't heard any English dialogue, but instead it sounded like French. Now I'm thinking, ""okay cool, I feel cultured now, no big deal.  I've been meaning to watch some foreign films.""  Then, I realize I see a plethora of dark faces. I try to suppress the distressing truth of how ignorant and uninformed I am (I blame America), when I think ""Oh yeah, France has black people toooooooooooo!!!!""  As a side note, I'm a Black American dude.  I still blame America.

I could feel my head exploding with the outrageous juxtaposition.  I thought to myself, ""enlightenment is a journey, not a destination."" I still feel pretty dumb though.  I'm not going to lie.

Girlhood is not the girl version of Boyhood, by any means. That's the first thing that you thought of, don't deny it.

It's a story of a young girl fed up with her circumstance in a working-class suburb of Paris.  Marieme (Karidja Toure, Skoken, Le grand journal de Canal) grew up poor with a struggling, hard working single mom, an abusive brother and a younger sister in need of protection.  Her opportunities are limited.  She aspires to go to academic high school but her grades are pushing her closer to vocational education.  She isn't exactly Cambridge bound.

With so little opportunity, Marieme falls in with a girl gang, is given the new name ""Vic"" and begins stealing to be accepted by the other girls.  It gets pretty dark pretty fast.
Girlhood definitely gave me a Fruitvale Station vibe. "" How could this not end badly?""

Honestly, it's very difficult to feel for Vic. Every time she played with my heart strings by being sweet, loving, and sensitive, she'd do something moronic.  She'd bully or rob some innocent, which apparently is a gateway to selling drugs.  I began doing what I hate.  I judged every life decision she'd make for my own convenience so that I'd feel better about myself.

Despite all of this, the movie was completely engrossing.

The duo who truly stole the show for a fella like myself were the director Celine Sciamma (Tomboy) and the cinematographer Crystel Fournier (Paris Can Wait, Tomboy). One of my favorite feelings to experience in life, is witnessing someone take a camera, and make a professional film on an amateur budget.

Fournier's skill was a pure exhibition in mise-en-cine leaving nothing to bare. It's always refreshing to see a film in her natural beauty. I go the theater to see films, my video games provide plenty of special effects.

If you love a raw, gritty indie, you'll bathe in Girlhood and feel good and dirty.  You'll smell like a bouquet of documentaries.

It wasn't long before I'd gotten used to the beautiful black faces speaking French while I read the subtitles. I'm ashamed that it was so jarring.  Maybe I'm not as open as I thought I was. However, I know admitting is the first step.

Girlhood,96,73,audience,I just didn't get into this movie like I had expected. It is extremely slow moving with lots of character development. I just didn't get attached to the main character. I appreciate that it was a low budget film with a large amount of thought and meaning to each scene. I understand that the director wanted to delve into the life of a black 16 year old girl from the projects as she navigates herself through different stages of development. Her life was terribly difficult but she still manages to be a girl. Just not that memorable of a film.
Girlhood,96,73,audience,"Unconvincing set up, leaving us with a patronising image of working class black girls (and to a much lesser extent working class black men) unable to escape their ""fates"", their choices reduced to automated responses, mixed in with boring plotting and direction that seeks the incidentally startling over the informative."
Girlhood,96,73,audience,Not sweet but a bitter coming of age film for these girls at the bottom of every social and economic ladder.
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
One of the many things I really like about Girlhood is how Sciamma's script manages to avoid all the 'urban genre trappings' while managing to see the affecting, clear-eyed coming-of-age narrative through.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
Girlhood is a very unique film that gives the viewer much to reflect on about the experiences of young black girls in Paris.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
[Celine] Sciamma is unflinching in her depiction of the physical, emotional and sociological warfare of adolescence - specifically, female adolescence.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
Girlhood stands as a singular, rarely-seen through a female-centric lens, a film about a disenfranchised group of teenage Black girls.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
Sciamma's latest is an adrenaline shot of socially aware filmmaking that's an invigorating and perspicacious exploration of adolescence.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
[Céline] Sciamma is at her best when the girls are alone together and also as in her earlier films when her characters seem to be exploring their sexual orientation and gender expression.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
Set in the lower class suburbs of France, Girlhood is as much an emotional journey as it is a visual one and a satisfying film from beginning to end.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
In this working-class setting, Sciamma conveys with naturalistic immediacy, it's their gender that renders them second-class citizens.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
Girlhood shines a poignant light on black female friendship, and the presence of violence feels like an unfortunate attempt at projecting racial verisimilitude. What's far more interesting is the sight of these four girls enjoying each other's company.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
This is a simple, clean film and (apart from the clumpy English title) very good.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
The complicated truth expressed in Girlhood is that it's often a survivor's strength that forges identities and occupations condemned by the rest of society-not weakness or hormonal confusion
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
A robust, forceful depiction this is of a type of personal story that gets virtually no screen time.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
Symptomatic of the national picture, Girlhood is an unflinching portrait into the seething cauldron of interminable chaos created by the fractured social structures in contemporary Paris.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
Compassionate, profound and pertinent...
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
Girlhood captures how wonderful it is to even briefly belong.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
[Marieme] has a long road into the seemingly inescapable marginalization of poor young black women ahead of her. But Girlhood offers some hope that the fleeting moments remain.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
More in common with the French New Wave than Italian neorealism, this is a film that both celebrates and sheds tears over gansta life. It is the French version of ""New Jack City"" in some ways.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
Girlhood stands on its own as a thoughtful, nonjudgmental look at a lost teen who finds definition over the course of a few rocky months.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
An uneasy but ultimately resilient view of inner-city femininity and self-discovery, Girlhood reminds viewers that no matter where you're from, going from girl to woman is always going to be a struggle.
 "
Girlhood,96,73,critic,"
In her previous features, Water Lilies and Tomboy, Sciamma focused on young characters in states of transition and discovery. Girlhood follows a trajectory of transformation, something that Toure achieves with effortless fluidity.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,audience,"Easily one of the best films of 2020. Kate Winslet slays in her performance alongside of Saiorse. Truly impressed by their courage to engage very naturally in intimate scenes that leave little to the imagination. Now I have two unforgetable 'nature pee' scenes of Kate. Her iconic nude scence in one of my personal favorites, ""Holy Smoke"" and a descreet quick relief moment while sitting on the rocks by the beach on Ammonite. Thank you Kate!"
Ammonite,68,85,audience,"A film I appreciate, but don't like, 'Ammonite' does a lot wrong despite some fantastic performances by the stars and supporting players.  The sound design is calming, but the slow burn didn't work for me with the end result.  There are several plot holes, not the least is a baby that is mentioned and then never acknowledged.  There are better films in this genre.  A major disappointment from Francis Lee is her sophomore feature film.  Final Score: 5/10"
Ammonite,68,85,audience,works as an enjoyable lesbian romance but im left craving something new 
Ammonite,68,85,audience,Generic - nothing new here and done much better elsewhere. Usual agenda pushing cash-in from Hollywood.
Ammonite,68,85,audience,"There are films that are better in terms of the theme of love between two women, an example of this is Carol (2015). Ammonite manages to create a remarkable atmosphere and setting, and you can see the care not only in the details, but in that the light, silences, etc. reflect an emotional state of sadness and loneliness. However, the biggest problem is that despite having two talented actresses (Ronan and Winslet), the film wastes their talent, and the characters are quite one-dimensional, it is not the fault of the actresses (who are proven talent) but of a lazy script that did not bother to provide us with information about those characters, in fact, about Ronan's character we know almost nothing, while Mary Anning (Winslet) reflects her only as a fossil trader, this in particular is misleading, because they could perfectly have replaced Mary Anning by a pearl hunter, a weaver, a seamstress, etc. and gived her with any entirely fictitious name and the result would be the same. When you take a real historical personality (in this case Anning) as a reference to shape your story and what results is a totally replaceable character, there is the feeling of deception: that they only took that historical character to attract the interest of the audience, but without a real narrative contribution. The open ending, rather than stimulating the imagination (as in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), only deepens that sense of ambiguity."
Ammonite,68,85,audience,Great acting and an interesting story about an unknown but fascinating real person from history. Some of the lesbian story matter was a little cliched but I was much relieved that the ending did not include a death and actually left open the possibility of a happy ending. Would very much recommend.
Ammonite,68,85,audience,"Yeah it passed the time and was quite boring and disappointing. It has lots of what I call ""emotional inaccuracies"". I love Kate Winslet and she played this part very well, up until Saoirse Ronan left in the carriage. Then she made some very bad acting choices that spoiled the film from then on. Saorse, after leaving in the carraige, then came alive at that point with her acting. We did not like Kate's Mary by the end and just wanted her to go home. Played very dead pan, no emotion by winslet who you just don't believe even loves Ronans character. Plus my wife (yes I'm gay) and I felt there was not enough dialogue in order to develop the characters relationship further through the whole middle part so we just didn't really believe these two REALLY loved each other. Due to lack of dialogue we felt that it contributed to the two characters not being fully explored, which was a real shame. It was too slow and boring to be honest."
Ammonite,68,85,audience,"I've been a fan of Saoirse Ronan since Brooklyn and she didn't disappoint in Ammonite.  Beware if you're an action aficionado, this is not your movie.  Those who enjoy getting into the heads of the characters might enjoy watching the decision processes they both go through.  You shouldn't watch this one with the kiddies, there is only one scene but it's very hot.  I prepared by being at my most laid back and it worked, I enjoyed the movie."
Ammonite,68,85,audience,Kind of cute? Kind of sexy? Not the most interesting story there ever was. But the setting is beautiful. It was pleasant. Had a vibe! I enjoyed.
Ammonite,68,85,audience,"Immersive, beautiful and fascinating."
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
In the same way Anning used her environment, Ammonite leans heavily on the natural beauty and decay of Lyme Regis.

Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Romantic story of two women scientists written out of history [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Ammonite swells with foreboding, rather than with astonishment. Viewers know where the narrative is heading, and soak in every moment of the gradual journey along the way.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Ammonite might be one of this year's biggest disappointments.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
If one were to be slightly facetious, an alternate title for Ammonite might be Portrait of a (Cornish) Lady on Fire.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
The film is often as chilly as the weather in this English seaside community.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
In comparison to other recent sapphic period dramas such as Portrait of a Lady on Fire and The Favourite, there is a distinct lack of spark between Ammonite's leads.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Despite solid performances by Kate Winslet & Saoirse Ronan, this stark, slow-simmering romance lacks the spark it needs to make it memorable.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Rejects the picturesque for something much more bracing - and certainly believable
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Stars Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan are terrific, both apart and together... However, it feels like a film of moments, rather than a truly compelling whole.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Ammonite has the talent bona fides and type of story to be an awards contender, but there's just that ineffable something missing from the narrative that holds it back.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Unfortunately, Ammonite is a prime example of a film based on real events that is significantly less interesting than the true story.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
While Mary never married, and carried on a lively correspondence with Charlotte and other women, it's a big leap to suggest she was a powderkeg of repressed sapphic longings
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Despite the passion from the leads Ammonite feels listless for much of its running time.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Ammonite starts as a small seed and quickly blossoms into a passionate expression of love.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
It's a lesbian love story that has great heart, but can't quite escape the dreariness of its setting and the bipolar emotions of its protagonist.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
Winslet gives one of the best performances of her career ...
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
It's always welcome to see more films that feature strong female characters, but there's so much here that feels too familiar.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
With its Oscar-bait November opening and lots of meaningful emotional glances, the lesbian love story loosely based on the life of famed paleontologist Mary Anning (1799-1847) will no doubt get some recognition this year.
 "
Ammonite,68,85,critic,"
It is unfair to judge a film for what it does not tell, rather than focusing on what it does. But the story here is not enough, and allows the mind to wander.
 "
Gideon's Army,100,88,audience,A raw look at the impossible job that public defenders have. An incredibly inspirational story of 3 individuals who fight for those society would turn away from and abandon.
Gideon's Army,100,88,audience,"As someone who studied Criminal Justice, nothing in this documentary really stood out or was new to me. It'd be good for someone who has little to no idea about what public defenders go through on a day to day basis."
Gideon's Army,100,88,audience,"This was an awesome documentary showing the hectic lives of public defenders. It shows public defenders deal with a lot of shit and not as much money as you think. And, they are not heartless. It breaks the stereotypes for defense lawyers, at least for public lawyers anyways. Definitely watch if you think justice systems are a joke."
Gideon's Army,100,88,audience,"A wonderful documentary about a very important topic. Director Nyree Dawn Porter really cares about her subjects, and chooses to give us a human story rather than just focus on the bigger issues. Like any good ""true story"" the characters are at the forefront, and the issue of the documentary becomes clear as we care about the people involved. It's so much easier to care about an issue when you're emotionally invested in the lives of people who are affected by the issue. This is what Porter does so effectively in Gideon's Army, and it's a film everyone in America should see."
Gideon's Army,100,88,audience,An inside look at public defenders. It will give you a newfound respect for these hardworking professionals.
Gideon's Army,100,88,audience,"interesting and touching exploration behind the scenes, what public defenders go through."
Gideon's Army,100,88,audience,"Millions of Americans are arrested each year, many of them obviously for crimes they did not commit. and the only legal representation that more than half of these people receive is provided by just a few thousand Public Defenders across the country. This heart-warming and heart-breaking documentary gives viewers a realistic picture of the consequences."
Gideon's Army,100,88,audience,Extremely well produced and directed documentary about public defenders in the Deep South. They have really opened up and you see just why they stay with the job. I was extremely moved.
Gideon's Army,100,88,audience,Excellent documentary.  Inspiring.
Gideon's Army,100,88,audience,"Often it's not the good fight, but it may still be right."

While not necessarily groundbreaking film work, it's a much needed piece to reveal what the people who work this largely thankless job go through daily.
 "
Gideon's Army,100,88,critic,"
Gideon's Army is a straightforward, eye-opening snapshot at the uncelebrated, but incredibly crucial work done by a relatively invisible population comprised of government employees.
 "
Gideon's Army,100,88,critic,"
While both the structure and most of the content of Gideon's Army are familiar, it does raise a few issues often left out of similar issues docs. One is the fact that many of the defendants are in fact guilty...
 "
Gideon's Army,100,88,critic,"
For all the harrowing truth here, about race and poverty and justice, the film is brisk and tight, alive with everyday detail and flashes of humor.
 "
Gideon's Army,100,88,critic,"
If Gideon's Army underscores anything it's that the right to counsel is being following in America by the letter of the law, but not the spirit.
 "
Gideon's Army,100,88,critic,"
Gideon's Army does what the best documentaries have always done: It makes us think about something we'd rather not.
 "
Gideon's Army,100,88,critic,"
Like the film itself, Porter's handful of devoted, charismatic attorneys do a righteous job of reminding people that the accused are innocent until proven guilty, and that the criminal justice system seems otherwise disposed.
 "
Gideon's Army,100,88,critic,"
The [public defenders'] personal stories turn out to be every bit as challenging as those of their clients, and their personal investment every bit as crucial.
 "
Gideon's Army,100,88,critic,"
""Gideon's Army"" is a bare film with no narrator and a minimal soundtrack. That's all it needs to grab you by the throat.
 "
Gideon's Army,100,88,critic,"
Dawn Porter's engrossing HBO documentary profiles three public defenders in the Deep South.

Gideon's Army,100,88,critic,"
Compelling insight into the staggering pressures faced by court-appointed public defenders.

John Lewis: Good Trouble,94,70,audience,Not very interesting.
John Lewis: Good Trouble,94,70,audience,"An excellent, moving film. It gives us the viewers a crystal clear insight into the late Rep. John Lewis's life through interviews with him, family, friends, staff, and colleagues. It's portrayal of Lewis shows a man with imperfections but of integrity and strength of character and conviction."
John Lewis: Good Trouble,94,70,audience,"This documentary is about the life of John Lewis, congressman and civil rights icon. The film uses interviews (many of them with Lewis as a much older but still committed fighter for civil rights) and archival film and photo sources to tell his story. It is a pretty ""standard"" documentary; there is nothing extraordinary about the filming or the approach. However, it is an inspiring story about a man who marched with Martin Luther King Jr and found himself arrested and sometimes beaten in his fight for civil rights. He became famous for saying that people should get into ""good trouble"". There is a lot of very important history here that still has relevance in 21st century America. We seem to live in a time when people who protest are considered anti-American or are otherwise vilified, but this is a wonderful call to arms that the fight is not anywhere near being over and that we all need to find ways to get into ""good trouble"" and make the change that needs to happen. The stage changes, but the play seems to remain the same. Big thumbs up for a powerful story of a man who devoted his life to making change. I highly recommend this film."
John Lewis: Good Trouble,94,70,audience,Congressman Lewis inspired me to get into some good trouble! It's been 55 years and the right to vote is still under attack today. Time to make a difference!
John Lewis: Good Trouble,94,70,audience,"It's been decades since Bloody Sunday, nearly 2 months since protests erupted over George Floyd's death and the fight is still not close to being over. The world lost another truly special soul and hope you will all take a moment to watch this inspirational film and think deeply about how we can honor him by getting into some ""good, necessary trouble."""
John Lewis: Good Trouble,94,70,audience,"A bio-pic of a real American hero.  This film puts John Lewis's life in context, and shows how the struggles of the Civil Rights Era are relevant today (and not in the ways that you'd think)."
John Lewis: Good Trouble,94,70,audience,"There is an old African proverb: ""When you pray, you move your feet.""   The proverb resonates powerfully in this quote from John Lewis' memoir, Walking in the Wind: ""As a nation if we care for the beloved community, we must move our feet, our hands, our hearts, our resources to build and not tear down, to reconcile and not to divide, to love and not to hate, to heal and not to kill.  In the final analysis, we are one people, one family, one house, the American house, the American family."" 

John Lewis is a powerful writer.  I read  Walking in the Wind several years ago, and it had a  powerful impact on me.  John Lewis: Good Trouble, the documentary, makes that same powerful impact:   It brings his story to life!  As in his memoir, the film reveals the man behind the legend.   

I was moved to tears by the footage from the 1960s.  I was beginning my teenage years back in 1963. Television was still a young medium, and it showed us all that was going on in the world daily.  I was learning about the world and its ways in the ‘60s—the injustices, the fight for dignity, freedom, equality and decency.  These were my middle school years, my high school years, formative years brought back to life as I watched this film. 

History repeats itself until we learn.  John Lewis: Good Trouble follows John Lewis throughout his young life in Alabama, working on his parent's farm, feeding chickens, picking cotton.  Mr. Lewis' narration of waking up early, hiding under the porch to wait for the school bus, running onto the bus to get to school to his wonderful teachers where he says he read everything, is a powerful visual image.  I love what one of his sisters says about John wearing a tie and carrying the Bible to school every day.  John was a serious student.  He wanted more in his life.  Clearly, he wanted to make a difference in our country for racial justice for African American people. His tireless work and dedication started as a college student. From SNCC leader to Congressman from Georgia, John Lewis fought the good fight for voter's rights, for civil rights, for the right to eat at the same restaurant as white people, for integration, not segregation.  His marches, his belief in nonviolence and commitment to the cause have continued for 65 years.

One story that Henry Gates Jr. tells about John Lewis' great-great grandfather getting his voting card back in the 1800s has a powerful twist. So many stories, so much history where he worked so hard from the time of Dr. Martin Luther King to President Barack Obama to now! 

This inspirational documentary is a must see.  John Lewis: Good Trouble weaves an important story about an exceptional man, shows us our history from the ‘60s to today, and demonstrates the part John Lewis played, and continues to play, as the fight for racial justice and equality is at a pivotal moment in time with the Black Lives Matter movement. 

I give John Lewis: Good Trouble 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it for 9 to 18-year-olds to learn about an effective leader and his plight—and to understand even further the times we are currently living through. I also recommend it to adults, to remember all that has transpired through the years, to reflect and act on how we can all move forward once and for all to make the change that is way long overdue.

John Lewis: Good Trouble,94,70,audience,"This is a necessary, timely portrait of an American hero who we all should know more about. Rep. Lewis has walked the walk for justice and equality for decades. As I watched, I realized how many intersecting points exist between him and iconic organizations, individuals and moments in our nation's history. SNCC, Freedom Rides, Marching in Selma … this man is a national treasure and I'm happy this film does justice to his remarkable story."

This Is the Sea,,17,audience,"I missed the first 15 minutes so it took a while to get into it. Funnily enough had just been talking about Gabriel Byrne and here he is! Northern Ireland, car bombs and a romea and juliet story in the middle.  Plus a weird old man and Samantha Morton in a thin white night gown in the rain!!"
Lourdes,93,68,audience,"Genteel to a fault but enormous detail in action, direction and intention by Testud and Seydoux"
Lourdes,93,68,audience,"There's much going on in this 'fly on the wall' style drama that is reminiscent (or perhaps prescient) of Ulrich Seidl's locked-off camera style that allows us to observe details at the edges of a shot that reveal much about the individuals involved. It takes loose aim at the fakery of the Lourdes 'experience', the battle that takes place between the enormous hope and optimism of the faithful and those who no longer believe in the possibility of miracles, with a beautifully orchestrated ending that leaves you wondering whether our heroine has won or lost her battle."
Lourdes,93,68,audience,Man...religion is so weird. Beautiful movie though.
Lourdes,93,68,audience,"It just dragged on and didn't engage me whatsoever despite the fact that my love was in it, Lea Seydoux....but hell, she was barely in it!"
Lourdes,93,68,audience,"I can't recall ever being disappointed by Sylvie Testud. She is akin to a younger generation Isabelle Huppert in that she is happy to work in areas about as far from the Multiplex circuit as you can get.
 Here she is again, acting largely with her eyes as a wheelchair confined invalid going along for the ride on a pilgrimage to Lourdes, by which I mean that it is a pilgrimage only for the group she is with, as 1) a sceptic and 2) bored and lonely because of her condition, she has more or less tagged along for lack of an alternative. There's a nice mix of satire and sentiment at work here as we note the commercial aspects of organised religion and the negative aspects of human nature masquerading as piety. Testud as always is superb and the film should be seen for her alone if nothing else."
Lourdes,93,68,audience,"A beautifully subtle lead performance from Sylvie Testud truly gifts this unusual and enigmatic film that can be read a multitude of ways (undoubtedly depending on the viewers own spirituality and/or religious beliefs), even to the point where it becomes unclassifiable (drama, black comedy, satire)."
Lourdes,93,68,audience,"Excellent, moving film."
Lourdes,93,68,audience,"Davvero uno dei migliori film sulla fede, sulle sue incertezze e sui suoi paradossi. La figura di Christine, unita a quella degli altri malati, condannati a vivere nella solitudine e nell'invidia, rappresenta al meglio l'imperfezione e la miseria dell'essere umano. Ma la vita è difficile anche quando si cammina con le proprie gambe e l'infelicità sembra una condizione insita nell'essere umano. Un film scomodo per la Chiesa ma anche per la stessa Lourdes."
Lourdes,93,68,audience,"It is a small and moderate, but very interesting human drama. Was it a miracle by God or not ? they relegate the judgment  to us."
Lourdes,93,68,audience,"Although the slow pace can be off-putting, there's a deeper investigation about miracles in this open-minded film.  Both reverent and skeptical, the story deals with both the commercialization of a holy site and the consequences of what could be a miracle."
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
Hausner's quietly provocative piece of arthouse cinema is a great example of her ever-expanding oeuvre as she continues her ingenious investigation into human behaviour.

Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
Hausner's 'Lourdes' handles religious faith and miracles with delicacy
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
Hausner directs with a kind of tremulous beauty, every frame, every nuance has a kind of gossamer perfection, luring the audience into a kind of spiritual experience all its own.
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
[Jessica Hausner's] thought experiment is an emotionally potent one.
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
Hausner frequently composes pictures in which our view is cut off by a wall, a pillar, or a pilgrim ... but like God's silence, these obstructions remain impenetrable.
 "

"
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
The withholding of judgment persists across Lourdes, which is comic, haunting, sweet, pious, unsettling, agnostic, and wholly deadpan at various moments.
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
Movies about miracles range from the awful to the unwatchable... that all changes with Jessica Hausner's Lourdes; it's a visually-striking, beautifully-realised, emotionally-devastating drama that both salutes and skewers the deeply-religious.

An odd, dispassionate religious film that will likely be more powerful for skeptics than true believers, it manages to most strongly suggest the possibility of grace by so clinically observing its opposite.
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
Spiritually flawed and often cynical though Hausner's pilgrims undoubtedly are, they're all too recognisably human.
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
The film was primarily shot on location, which gives it a heaviness, an historic weight, that dominates the movie much more than anything to do with character or plot does.
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
This off-centre film looks like a paean to devotion ... and yet Hausner quietly and cleverly undermines this
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
In a film rich with provocative questions, Hausner audaciously examines the ambivalent nature of miracles. Are they gifts from a loving God or random occurrences, bereft of any moral or meaning?
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
Hausner manages and controls our expectations in this superbly subtle, mysterious and brilliantly composed film.
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
At the heart of the film is Sylvie Testud, one of the most beguiling actresses in the world, and whom I would happily pay to watch do nothing more than sleep for 24 hours.
 "
Lourdes,93,68,critic,"
A film featuring the kind of compelling, textured female character that most serious Hollywood actresses would trade at least a decade's worth of Botox to get their claws into.

It's beautifully shot, nicely acted and about as dry as comedies get. In fact, it's so dry it might not be a comedy at all.

This film is both good and powerful. It saves the God debate, still intact, for another round. It is as magically, richly ambivalent as life itself.

Party Girl,79,76,audience,"Parker Posey stars as an all-nighter, Mary in the big city but her life seems to be going nowhere for the most part 
because of a recent rave she hosts Mary ends up getting arrested and must find a way to pay for her income as well as her lifestyle
she decides to get a job as a librarian and prove she can actually make something for herself
Omar Townsend plays a charming Lebanon food vendor who takes quite the liking towards her, being a teacher he can't go any further 
Mary's life pretty much plays out like a library of books that's out of order; if it isn't organized the system falls apart as does everything around her 
Maybe working as a librarian will help run some of the intelligent literacy Mary desperately needs, she's so worried she's not qualified for anything she may end up like her mother 
Even her Aunt Judy nudges her to absorb some education to stop ruining her life filled with mistakes and excessive partying 
It's only after Mary gets a taste of reality she switches from the all-nighters to focusing on acquiring life skills 
Yes we can stay out all night but sooner or later we have to set goals for ourselves down the line, life can still be a party as long as we can still teach ourselves what others can teach, most librarians who are women have fought long and hard to make the establishment organized but also accessible to everyone willing to learn 
This is Parker Posey's movie truly being an inspiration for any young woman or person to be something wanting to not be lost in life 
She is a diva but also somebody not completely devoid of capable thought and higher-learning
It's hip, sexy, filled with rocking beats of the era, and has a lesson of books opening up our minds to passions and dreams that would rarely come to us on our own 
Posey is a lot of fun and so full of energy in this early indie flick"

Children of a Lesser God,79,78,audience,"A romantic version of The Miracle Worker with education subplots that would suggest the coming of films like Stand and Deliver and Dead Poets Society, Children of a Lesser God may have been legitimately innovative in its treatment of deaf characters but its love story feels pretty predictable, intermittently sappy, and drawn out. Much of this is offset by the performances of both Hurt and Matlin, who are energetic, involved, passionate, and play off one another very well, even with Hurt echoing Matlin's lines so that the audience can understand them (which may have been a necessity in the original stage play, but subtitles might have been more suitable in a film adaptation, allowing the pace of conversations to be better preserved). A big detractor for the film is the soundtrack, with strange, creaky instrumentals hanging over pivotal scenes that sound as if they were made by barn door hinges. External threats and secondary subplots are established but never followed up on, as James unorthodox teaching methods are initially called into question but never condemned, and the rebellious members of class are never given enough attention to matter, but instead just break up the monotony of the protagonists' relationship. Well-intentioned, but poorly aged. (3/5)"

Children of a Lesser God,79,78,audience,"Marlee Matlin is fantastic. Bill Hurt is always wonderful—ditto for Piper Laurie. The silent arguments between the romantic leads are surprisingly effective. But the story is thin, and often carried by a relentlessly romantic score.

Children of a Lesser God,79,78,audience,"I think the film, although strong minded at it's base, is horribly dated. The leading man comes off incredibly controlling and chauvinistic, whereas I think in 1986 he probably appealed romantically, passionately. I also strongly think the film should use subtitles for when Matlin speaks in ASL. I understand it is based off the stage play, however it takes away from her power as a performer and a woman to constantly have the male translating for her to the audience."
Children of a Lesser God,79,78,audience,"A classic, they don't make movies like this anymore!!!"
Children of a Lesser God,79,78,audience,"I have a tendency to enjoy romantic dramas more than most and therefore I was highly susceptible to the charms of this film as cliché as they sometimes were. What breathes new life into this story of a couple facing a disability is the impressive acting from William Hurt and Marlee Matlin and the film's sensitive treatment of it's subject matter. Many films do not manage to convince of a romantic connection between two people but this is that rare film that does and despite how cheesy the film is it goes a lot deeper than most romantic films in explaining the breakdown of a relationship.

A teacher for deaf children with unorthodox methods, James Leeds, William Hurt, moves to a small town to teach at a new school where he encounters a beautiful but troubled young deaf janitor, Sarah Norman, Marlee Matlin. He pursues a romantic relationship with her while also urging her to speak and read lips which she is made uncomfortable by. The two do eventually commit to one another and she moves out of the house of her overbearing mother, Mrs. Norman, Piper Laurie, in addition to quitting her job to be with him. This puts even more strain on their relationship as she resents the way she is condescended to and this causes their relationship to collapse. They experience extreme loneliness and longing for one another when separated and are eventually able to reconcile.

One of the biggest difficulties that the film faces in working is communicating to the audience, usually not fluent in sign language, what the main female character is saying. They get around this by having Hurt incredulously say everything that Matlin is communicating, this sounds ridiculous and in theory is frustrating to the audience but Hurt is such a great actor that he makes it work. We feel all of the emotions in the conversations as Matlin is able to convey so much without even speaking as her face contorts itself into expressions of rage and regret. We very quickly forget about the device being used to dispense information to us about what Matlin is saying, it really doesn't matter because we care more about the emotional conflict than the verbal sparring.

The film also succeeds in building up a very sweet, enjoyable to watch courtship between our two main characters that climaxes in a rather beautiful love scene. We see the two of them flirt as she is perennially annoyed and upset, we later find out why, while he is desperate to get to know her better and the push and pull between them is electric because of the chemistry between Hurt and Matlin. Their first date is excellent as it introduces all of the conflicts that will later bring their relationship to an end as he is simultaneously able to make her more secure and bring her out of her shell while also overwhelming her and making her feel shameful over her condition. The pool love scene has an unexpected eroticism to it as we see Matlin's naked figure floating in the water and yet she is not filmed with an aggressive male gaze, the director is female, but with a touch that feels as though it appreciates the beauty of her body but also the strength she possesses. The coming together of the two is seen in a soft light as we see the expressions of the actors faces more than their bodies or actions and we feel a certain joy for these characters.

Director Randa Haines deserves a lot of credit for her work here as she brings the correct sensibility to material like this indulging the sweeter moments while seeing the hard realism necessary to confront the issues that the film could have just touched upon. She introduces us to our characters very quickly but we know immediately who they are and after this point we get to settle in to spending time in their company and witness them change each other. She brings elements of the classical romantic melodrama to the picture and some of the visuals certainly recall Douglas Sirk but she makes us feel that we are watching something wholly original because we are so swept up in the story."
Children of a Lesser God,79,78,audience,The best inspiring romance movie ever made!
Children of a Lesser God,79,78,audience,"Children of a Lesser God is the story of a hearing man who falls in love with a deaf woman. It’s probably best that I don’t go into too much personal detail about my passion for the Deaf community, but it is hard for me to talk about this movie without at least mentioning it. I’ve wanted to learn ASL basically my entire life (at least since elementary school) but I haven’t taken the time to get good at it, and working with the Deaf or any special needs group is kind of a dream job of mine. So I had an instant connection to this film, because the subject matter is something I already care about deeply. I appreciated that they cast a large number of real deaf people, including the astounding Marlee Matlin, because it stopped this movie from any mockery or condescension. Instead the film celebrated those who can’t hear, while also confronting some of the challenges they face when interacting with a hearing world. I wish more of the film was spent focusing on the students in the school, because I thought there were some interesting dynamics in that classroom. However, the film leans hard into the romantic relationship, and doesn’t leave much time to deal with anything else. Some of the struggles that they faced all were rooted in the same couple of problems, so it made the arguments feel repetitive. I think this is true to life, because most real relationships have a tendency to deal with the same issues over and over again, but it can get tedious to watch in a film. But my biggest complaint in Children of a Lesser God was the fact that they decided to omit subtitles. It gets so tedious having William Hurt translate almost all the sign language in the film. It doesn’t seem natural for him to do this, particularly when alone with Marlee Matlin. The easy solution would be to subtitle what is being signed, but at the time studios were too afraid reading would turn off American viewers. The best aspect of Children of a Lesser God is that it doesn’t succumb to an unrealistic or clichéd Hollywood ending. There isn’t a simple solution that fixes everything, Marlee Matlin doesn’t have to alter her convictions to accommodate William Hurt, and there’s no miraculous healing that makes it seem like deafness (or not speaking) is the flaw that was ruining everything. There is more going on in this film than I initially thought, which makes it one I want to see again. The characters have problems that they cannot clearly articulate, and the problems don’t have simple solutions. It’s a drama that happens to involve deafness as a central theme, but it uses that theme as a way of exploring the kind of human issues that we all deal with, particularly in romantic relationships. While I think the film is flawed, and the fixes for those flaws would have been relatively simple, I still enjoyed watching Children of a Lesser God a lot, and it makes me want to get back to learning ASL.

The Artist's Wife,64,78,audience,"A moving, if sometimes slightly disjointed look at the life of a wife who gave up her pursuit to be an artist to support the painting career of her talented, famous and affluent but capricious and egotistical husband, a challenge made all the more difficult by the onset of Alzheimer's disease, making him more volatile and unpredictable than ever. The dynamics of a woman torn between wanting to support her beloved and pull away to attend to her own needs are examined in multiple permutations, presenting a profile of a character frustrated while attempting to be conciliatory in multiple regards. The superb lead performances by Lena Olin and Bruce Dern, backed by a fine supporting cast, really make this picture, helping it shine even when its sometimes-meandering narrative lets them down. A worthwhile candidate for awards season, especially in the acting categories."
The Artist's Wife,64,78,audience,"Good actoing, trite plot."

The picture of the artist in Dolby's film has very little to do with the history of genuine art, which involves immense sacrifice, suffering and struggle, and protest.

The Artist's Wife isn't a film that has any clear resolution at the end and it leaves the viewer feeling somewhat hopeless.
 "
The Artist's Wife,64,78,critic,"
The Artist's Wife is a complicated story that weaves together issues of father-daughter relationships, the role of a step-mother, and the need to be wanted as Claire's artistic talents are reawakened.

Olin's dynamic performance is worth the price of admission.
 "
The Artist's Wife,64,78,critic,"
The paired performances, by Dern as the painter losing control and Olin as the helpmeet trying to keep him together, have a lived-in quality that put ""The Artist's Wife"" a rung or two above the average melodrama.
 "
The Artist's Wife,64,78,critic,"
Ultimately, the movie's occasional lack of cohesion is superseded by the good (but not great) performances by lead actors Lena Olin and Bruce Dern.

By refusing to compromise about life's messiness, it makes an art of chaos in elegantly composed vignettes filmed with a chilly beauty, and gives us an ending that is maddening, yet absolutely true.

""The Artist's Wife"" is not without similarities to the 2017 Glenn Close-Jonathan Pryce vehicle ""The Wife."" Yet, the elegiac tone Dolby adapts is markedly different, lending a melancholy but ultimately hopeful feel to the story.
 "
The Artist's Wife,64,78,critic,"
It's not difficult to see where ""The Artist's Wife"" is going. It gets there with a soft, syrupy piano score..., with Dolby's pretty compositions; and characters forever posed in front of gorgeous art or architecture.

Bull,90,65,audience,Bull is a film about a young teen girl who has been on the wrong side of the tracks and how she winds up bonding with an aging bullfighter.  The two actors are pretty good here and make the story compelling...supporting players are a bit lacking and the ending just kinda is.... but the film was going for a level of observant realism
Bull,90,65,audience,"What starts out with much promise unfortunately loses its way in the final act with far too many underdeveloped and unresolved story threads. This tale of a wayward teen who starts finding her way in life under the reluctant mentorship of her crusty neighbor, a onetime rodeo bull rider beset by borderline addiction issues and chronic health problems, veers off in too many directions that one hopes will eventually come together but don't. While director Annie Silverstein's refreshingly unconventional approach frequently defies expectation in many entertaining and enlightening ways, the filmmaker frequently doesn't seem to know what to do with these developments once she introduces them, especially in the area of character development. Thus the powerful and intriguing setup that emerges in the first two acts is regrettably squandered in the home stretch as the narrative fails to coalesce in a cohesive and impactful way. To the film's credit, Rob Bowman's outstanding lead performance as the aging former rodeo star helps to hold things together well, but even that is ultimately not enough to save this aspiring but wanting debut feature."
Bull,90,65,audience,"I love Rob Morgan and he's great, but there just ins't enough connective tissue or words on the page to recommend this.  The husband and wife ""writing"" team of Annie Silverstein (Directed) and Johnny McAllister just don't seem to have a handle on this from jump. Allow me to use that word ""writing"" LOOSELY as this duo give us a clunker and that's no 'Bull'.   It's cast (other than Morgan) poorly and it's a slog.  This could have easily and should have been a short.  It wasn't worth my time.  Final Score: 3.8/10"
Bull,90,65,audience,"Black Snake Moan meets Lean On Pete.
Pretty conventional story of a young girl overcoming obstacles with the help of a beaten-down old man. 
If this movie got picked up by someone like A24 I think it would've gotten a little more acclaim. 
As a Houstonian I really wanted this to be better than it was, and at the same time, it was much better than I was expecting.
Rob Morgan is really terrific and there is a really effective display of naturalism that balances the dangerous with mundane. 
There are a number of scenes (like the last meeting of Kris and her Mom in prison) that make Bull worth visiting."
Bull,90,65,audience,One of the slowest movies I have ever watched.
Bull,90,65,audience,I thought this movie was going to be absolutely inspiring from the trailer it  turned into the most boring uneventful ridiculous movie wasted two hours of my life could've gone in an absolute incredible inspiring direction and went nowhere disaster
Bull,90,65,audience,"Kris and her sister live with her grandma in a poor neighborhood in Houston, TX while her mother serves a prison sentence. Abe, Kris' neighbor, used to ride bulls on the Black rodeo circuit but, due to injuries now works on the circuit as the guy who deflects the bulls when riders fall off. Kris and her friends break into Abe's house while he is gone, drink his booze, and trash his house. Rather than send her to juvie, he agrees to allow her to clean up his house and work for him in exchange. The film is about the relationship that develops between them. I really enjoyed the film. Rob Morgan who plays Abe and Amber Harvard (who plays Kris and appears to be a newcomer) are both strong actors who make great co-leads and have great chemistry. I also really liked the story; it is similar to the Florida Project in its depiction of the lives of people who live on the economic margins and like The Rider in its story about a bull rider who suddenly has to find a new identity. The screenplay wanders somewhat, and it lacks the depth of either of the two films described above but thumbs up for a compelling, sensitive, and believable examination of the ways the relationship changes both of them."
Bull,90,65,audience,"Best drama of 2020!!! 

Bull has a heartwarming story line and the acting is incredible! The movie explores the complex and heartfelt relationship between the two characters and once again prove that genuine connections can be found in the most unexpected places. This is an absolute must see!"
Bull,90,65,audience,Even though the setting and acting felt genuine and realistic the movie did not gain my interest at any time ultimately leading to boredom and disappointment.
Bull,90,65,audience,"I'm sure adjectives like 'quiet', 'understated', and 'intimate' have been used for this film. They are fitting descriptions in some aspects, but do not think this is a film that is easily summed up with just a few apt descriptive words. 
𝘉𝘶𝘭𝘭 is a film that deals head on with characters who see no real better lot in life than the one they're already in, though Kris can see on with a trailer she can live in for free in exchange for 'a little work on the farm'. Rob could have one with his ex, who clearly has feelings for him beyond an occasional hook-up. But we never really get a sense of anyone in this town/movie truly excited or joyous about anything. 
It is also a film that shows just how much we lie, deceive, fabricate excuses, live in denial. And the more desperate and disenfranchised of us do it to ourselves nearly as much as we do it unto others. Though it may range from a more innocuous brushing off a hurtful word to blatantly ignoring a serious medical issue, it is something that far too many of us do far too often. With Rob Morgan's Abe, such deception will mean an even more broken body, and will, and an empty bed. With Kris, it's as if her life is an after thought, as she is herself in much of the movie, so lying or even criminal behavior seem to not mean what they do to most of us. She just seems very much adrift, as someone would likely be with no father or mother present. These two people are better for knowing each other, as unlikely as that is. 
Morgan and Havard are exceptional. 3.6 stars"

What it lacks in focus and narrative drive, it makes up for in authenticity and grittiness.

Bull had the makings of a powerful story... Yet, it gets abandoned in favor of a typical and slightly undercooked friendship story.
 "
Bull,90,65,critic,"
It's disarming and unflinchingly humane.
 "
Bull,90,65,critic,"
Bull is too rooted in gritty realism to fall into easy clichés about redemption or to offer pat resolutions.
 "
Bull,90,65,critic,"
In its best moments, Bull's close, direct observation of character and intimate rendition of time and place reminded me of the films of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne.
 "
Bull,90,65,critic,"
Maudlin, quiet, and natural, 'Bull' captures, with a raw edge, the lives of a marginalized society within a marginalized society, and how human connection can still grow therein.
 "
Bull,90,65,critic,"
Low-key, naturalistic drama with a lot of familiar beats whose strength is in depicting a child at the crossroads.
 "
Bull,90,65,critic,"
As Abe, Rob Morgan carries a weary self-assurance and the bone-deep wisdom of a survivor, and it's heartbreaking, in this story about found family and forgiveness.
 "

Rob Morgan has always been a gifted character actor, but here Silverstein gives him the opportunity to show how formidable he is at shepherding the narrative.

Silverstein gives us a window onto the lives of people passed over in America, who nonetheless manage to find glimmers of joy, even as they fight against those who would bring them down.

Bull,90,65,critic,"
An honest and raw look at rodeo life and the everyday pain from which it serves as a distraction.
 "

How Bull finds connection between people living in the margins is successful thanks primarily to Rob Morgan, whose work here deserves the notice he should have had his entire career.

The risk to a story like Bull's is the potential pitfall of the endless stories of Black victims shown as admirable by overcoming their victimhood with service.

A Call to Spy,72,82,audience,A thought provoking and insightful movie about British spy activity in France. Definitely recommended- the best movie I have watched in a while!
A Call to Spy,72,82,audience,A bit of a waste of the subject matter.
A Call to Spy,72,82,audience,"A gripping veridical spy movie whose gritty realism can only truly be appreciated when one steps in the shoes of the protagonists, two brave women spies who go into Nazi controlled France. Radhika Apte, as Noor Inaya Khan, Britain's first Muslim war hero and Sarah Megan Thomas as Virginia Hall, an ambitious American woman with a wooden leg, give brilliant performances as civilian women who turn into  indomitable spies. 

Based on real events, one of the best spy movies I have seen."
A Call to Spy,72,82,audience,"Littered with historical inaccuracies, wooden and confusing. Gave up after 2/3 way through. One of the worst movies of this genre I have ever seen"
A Call to Spy,72,82,audience,"Supposedly giving a version of the female contribution to WW2, sacrifice etc. And ironically I was listening to Us and Them this morning, which makes this all the more perverse with the usual instigators lolling back in England drinking scotch while millions were murdered around the world."
A Call to Spy,72,82,audience,"I don't write movie reviews but I had to for this one. The contributions of women to the war effort in World War II is a tale that needs to be told, but this is not the movie to do so. Like so many modern movies it feels the need to layer over present day sensibilities to past events, with such heavy handed posturing you can feel yourself being bashed over the head. Particularly disturbing is the strong hint dotted about the movie that anti-Semitism in Britain is not much different to nazi Germany, ""they're not much safer here"" is thrown in early and a main character Vera fears she must hide her Jewish heritage to get a chance at gaining British citizenship being hamstrung by ‘xenophobic' higher echelons. Especially insulting to the many Jews that fled to Britain and made it their home. 

The cinematography is low budget, the acting poor. Characters are not introduced so lack depth. The plot is barely strung together and lacks suspense. I think the ratings are only so high because so few people watched it."
A Call to Spy,72,82,audience,"The script was so-so, as was the directing. Acting again was okay, but nothing outstanding.  For me the film lacked energy - the pacing was too even - it just went along without any real peaks and troughs. Given the subject matter, the moments where we might have been on the edge of our seats, left me laid back. I think a re-edit with some sharper cutting, inventive use of sound and some period music would have pepped it up a bit."
A Call to Spy,72,82,audience,"I really really liked this movie. Pace may have lagged in a few places but it was still extremely engaging and the courage, uplifting. I appreciated it being family friendly as regards sex/language but there are some torture scenes."
A Call to Spy,72,82,audience,"this movie was enjoyable, it was nice to a majority of women playing the lead roles, not so much factual, but you intriguing, it brings light and spark to 1945, over all enjoyable but did drag out, just a bit"
A Call to Spy,72,82,audience,"Astonishly well-made, poorly scripted, horribly directed, comedically acted travesty to honour true heroes. Interesting."

It helps that Katic, Thomas and Khan all turn in involving performances, although Thomas wrote herself the best role.

 "
A Call to Spy,72,82,critic,"
The film serves as a fine, honourable tribute to the incredible bravery of those unheralded women who formed a crucial part of the Allied spy operation... though, sprinkled throughout are tell-tale signs that it did not have much of a budget.

A Call to Spy,72,82,critic,"
Dramatically inert and oddly unaffecting, A Call to Spy does a disservice to the incredible women that it wants to honour
 "
A Call to Spy,72,82,critic,"
It's worth seeing for a portrayal of World War II female espionage that's not really taught in history classes. However, the movie gives the impression that people would be better off reading nonfiction books to get a sense of who these women really were.
 "
A Call to Spy,72,82,critic,"
This is a film with big ideas but a modest budget, and sadly that is its biggest downfall.
 "
A Call to Spy,72,82,critic,"
A Call to Spy will be of some small interest to those studying how feminist politics can be co-opted, but the poor script and uneven structure make it a miss for all but the most ardent fans of wartime dramas.

Telling her story on screen, along with those of other undersung heroines, is a more dynamic living tribute than any building could be.

It's no big-budget epic, but director Lydia Dean Pilcher's second feature proves to be a fascinating tale of distaff derring-do.

There's nothing at all wrong with the performances, but there's nothing terribly remarkable, either.

Chemical Hearts,60,70,audience,me encanto el final y la actuacion de lili reinhart
Chemical Hearts,60,70,audience,Es una pelicula muy real!!!
Chemical Hearts,60,70,audience,"Lili Reinhardt is amazing in this role as is her costar. Character driven, romantic, and touches on the reality of trauma. I love the way the relationship between the characters slowly progresses and how they're there for each other."
Chemical Hearts,60,70,audience,"Melodramatic teenage story about the relationship between a shy inexperienced boy and an emotionally and physically damaged girl... Austin Abrams and ""Riverdale's"" Lili Reinhart star in this and they have some good chemistry and the story does have some resonance but it never strays all that far from the formulaic elements."
Chemical Hearts,60,70,audience,"Chemical Hearts is a fairly bland teenage drama. Lili Reinhart was great in her role. I wish the film focused on her. Austin Abrams was a pretty bland lead. The film doesn’t really capture how teenagers act or talk. You can tell the dialogue was written by adults who have a tenuous grasp on teenage interaction. The film hits nearly every single cliche one would expect to see. It doesn’t do a thing original. Overall, a good performance can’t make up for a cliches story and bad writing. There are so many good teen movies out there, even from 2020 (Spontaneous and Babyteeth come to mind). Watch one of those instead of this. "
Chemical Hearts,60,70,audience,"Henry Page wants to be editor of his newspaper in school. 
Writing has always been his passion. But nothing has happened to him to make things extraordinary. Until he meets Grace Town who transfers from another school. 
The movie is pretty much two high school students played by Austin Abrams and Lilli Reinhart meeting and falling in love. Grace and Henry are totally different but one of them holds a secret that could change things. Grace has to use a cane because of an injury. So she acts dismissive and surly to everyone that tries to be friendly.
Is she ready to move on and be happy with Henry or will she always be stuck backwards?
The world wants us to express ourselves but the problem is when we actually try to do it they tell you to shut up. Being young is so painful it's what every author can't avoid when they write. Teenage years are limbo being between a kid an adult etc. For some it's easier to slip into their own abyss and forget the world exists. Maybe some are so messed up that they can't be fixed like a broken vase. Love is a chemical reaction that comes and goes. Scars are not reminders for what's been broken but rather what can be created.
A movie that shows it's hard to let go of the past especially when you're at such a young age when you're not ready for it so early.
Abrams and Reinhart have palpable chemistry. It's true too that certain chemicals make you do strange things. As a teenager you're prone to feel loneliness and powerlessness. Anyone can feel these giant confusing emotions whether young or old.
'Chemical Hearts' is all about self discovery and the many ups and downs of falling in love, grief, heartbreak, and learning to deal with the harshness."
Chemical Hearts,60,70,audience,"""Chemical Hearts"" is a pretty standard teenage melodrama, and that is its greatest strength and weakness. If you like these types of movies, this one plays it fairly safe and delivers what it promises. The problem is that the movie doesn't have enough substance to be one of the greats. I also think the tone is constantly bleak and it could have benefitted from a little humor, even just a handful of scenes could have made a difference. Overall, it is a decent teenage romance with solid chemistry between the two leads, but left more to be desired as far as the story goes."
Chemical Hearts,60,70,audience,"Chemical Hearts somehow felt emotionally manipulative and sadly genuine at the same time, and I believe that was a product of a uniquely somber story mixed with extremely earnest, almost precocious acting by Lili Reinhart and Austin Abrams. Reinhart is especially good at playing the mature, but emotionally wooden characters she's done in the past, and director Richard Tanne and his crew did a very good job making the film from a technical perspective. His filmy, contrasted lighting style emulates what pleases young viewers aesthetically, and he knows how to make a film of teens for teens."
Chemical Hearts,60,70,audience,"It is one of the better Coming Of Age movies. It is actually impressing. The acting is surprising, the story flows nicely and the relationship is handled pretty well. The ending is something fresh and new. Other moves like that would make them get back together. This movie tries to stay true to reality. Makes sense. And it is handled really well. I just wanted both of them to be happy in the end, which makes the conclusion to the movie even better. It actually feels like teenagers are trying to get into a relationship. Feel pretty real. Check it out!"

If your bad poetry from high school about unrequited love was made into a film, it would be Chemical Hearts, an angsty young adult mope fest that beats the cliches of teenage soap operas to a plaid-wearing, meet-in-an-abandoned-factory pulp.

Chemical Hearts may not distinguish itself among the glut of movies about sensitive high-schoolers enjoying romance and emotional challenges, but its leads have charm and chemistry.

The film still follows the same formula of many young adult adaptations, albeit with its own handful of variables to try and change things up to varying success.

I still feel a strong connection to the teenage girl who felt too much, who sometimes wasn't very attached to the idea of being alive, who experienced the hardships of first love, and this movie was made for that girl.

Chemical Hearts,60,70,critic,"
There was clearly love poured into the project, and it teases more to come from young talents like Abrams and Reinhart. The film shows there's more to come from this pool of talent. Unfortunately, it doesn't allow them much room to show off.

What I really liked best about ""Chemical Hearts"" is how it subtly allows the story to breathe.
 "

With solid acting from its two leads and sharp direction from Richard Tanne, Chemical Hearts is a well-told tale about first love that takes the high road in its storytelling; making it more dramatically satisfying and substantial than expected.
 "
Chemical Hearts,60,70,critic,"
For YA movie fans, it may offer a nice change of pace from the recent glut of cheerier rom coms, but the best of those titles capture the prickliness of adolescence far more effectively than Chemical Hearts.
 "
Chemical Hearts,60,70,critic,"
There's a darkly intriguing tone to this thoughtful teen drama. Although it's rather mopey and naggingly disconnected from reality, like most films based on young-adult novels.

The Dig,88,78,audience,This has no business being interesting so I give the actors and writers credit because I remained interested 3.2
The Dig,88,78,audience,"The kind of film you'll enjoy on a bad weather day. There are some things here that I felt I've seen in other films before, so the experience as a whole was like walking on known, flat grounds. Some potential wasted here and there, lifted by the good performances and a beautiful score. The warm, earthy cinematography was also good, with some Malick vibes there.

I repeat, I'm not a huge fan of period films, but I know fans of this genre will find it entertaining."
The Dig,88,78,audience,"While I enjoyed the premise and individual performances, the movie lacks enough connective tissue to make it all coherent - but, I still gave it a 70% as encouragement"
The Dig,88,78,audience,"A film that resonates with the soul. Captures something of humanity, in our suffering and desires. Made my heart long, I'm not sure what for...

The only shame was the cliched message that love is simply about following one's heart; nothing to do with commitment and sacrifice in order to build something beautiful and lasting.

Nevertheless, a great film and another top class performance from Ralph Fiennes."
The Dig,88,78,audience,"The Dig is a finely observed, elegant film about history, humanity and human connection. It's a very good film that has shades of greatness thanks to two stellar lead performances. Australian theatre director Simon Stone has brought his nuanced theatre work to this project and his film shows care and aptitude for the story. It's a true story, based on the 1939 excavation of Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. Land owner Edith Pretty employs excavator Basil Brown to 'dig' into burial mounds on her property. After much hard work he discovers rivets from an ancient ship from possibly the 6th century. It's a huge discovery, bringing a major response from the British Museum. The centre of the film, apart from the excavation, is the story of the people involved. Edith and Basil develop a strong bond. Likewise Basil and Edith's son Robert. It's a lovely intertwining of the story of the past and of the present. It delicately looks at how humans have lived and live now. It's all made more dramatic as World War Two approaches. It does get slightly derivative in parts, especially with a superfluous romantic sub plot. But it's a fine film with Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes absolutely superb in the feaure roles. Their grace and humanity shine through leaving quite an indelible impression."
The Dig,88,78,audience,"Despite fine production values and an excellent performance by Ralph Fiennes, this elegant period piece about a lonely widowed heiress who hires an underappreciated amateur archaeologist to excavate an enigmatic site on her estate looks great but has considerable trouble keeping its focus on the central narrative. Director Simon Stone's latest introduces a growing number of story threads as the picture progresses, many of them not particularly interesting, that draw attention away from where the film starts, a launching point that's not especially compelling tale to begin with. The movie's lavish production values, beautiful cinematography and sweeping score help to make this release appear better than it actually is, but, once those cover attributes are swept aside, viewers are left with an underwhelming offering that's not as engaging as the filmmakers believe it to be."
The Dig,88,78,audience,melodramatic and corny.  I thought Weinstein was in jail.  It's like his Oscar-bait garbage for old ladies.
The Dig,88,78,audience,This is a lovely film.
The Dig,88,78,audience,"Beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted by Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan.  ""The Dig"" takes its time to uncover its findings as well as its pleasures.  It starts as a quiet British drama that becomes more moving as it plods along.  The more they dig the more satisfying the depth.  Lily James and Johnny Flynn give excellent support in a side plot.  Though not fast paced or suspenseful in any way.  The quiet pleasures are what makes this worth a watch."

Dreamland,59,65,audience,Well crafted low budget film in the ilk of a modern day Bonnie and Clyde trying to escape current situations
Dreamland,59,65,audience,"This love story is set during one of the toughest times of our history, The Great Depression. It follows Eugene Evans, a young man struggling to find his place in the world with big dreams to live a life of adventure. When the news hits of a bank robbery nearby with one of the fugitives on the run, this peaks Eugene's interest being that the fugitive has a large bounty for her capture. As fate would have it shortly after Eugene discovers the fugitive, Allison Wells, had taken refuge in his family's garage with a gunshot wound. Allison's nature is infectious and with the growing attraction and chemistry between the two Eugene becomes torn on how to proceed, claiming the bounty or breaking bad. Left with a choice that could forever change his life and all those around him in this coming-of-age tale. 

This films cinematography is second to none and the gorgeous shots of the setting throughout this movie are robust, really bringing the era's setting to life.  The acting in this film is extraordinary but the lack of the same caliber script and story is noticeable. If not for fantastic performances and an absolute electric chemistry on screen between Finn Cole and Margot Robbie this may have been more forgettable. This film still impresses even with its somewhat predictable ending it manages to end uniquely enough in its own right."
Dreamland,59,65,audience,Actually a good story which a lot of movies don't have anymore.
Dreamland,59,65,audience,2 out of 5 stars. Dreamland is a snoozefest drama. That tries to be something with its uneven drama. Trying to be a romantic love story mixed with bonnie and clyde which fails to do both. The direction is uneven. The acting is flat with Finn Cole and Margot Robbie. The story is dull. And it is one dull film.
Dreamland,59,65,audience,"Predictable, like so many American movies."
Dreamland,59,65,audience,"This movie is so well acted, margot robbie's performance is so good once again. The costume designs and locations are great. Underrated movie, and it clearly deserved a better score here."
Dreamland,59,65,audience,"I feel this is an underrated film. Margot Robbie is her usual convincing self and the visuals are stunning. One of the most cinematically pleasing movies of 2020. Plot left something to be desired , ending was a little ambiguous but still left the theatre pleased that I spent my 11 dollars"
Dreamland,59,65,audience,"Dreamland is a small but beautiful little film. It doesn't quite hit all the spots though. I left thinking that there was scope for this film to explode into greatness, but it never quite gets there. Set in the dust bowl of Texas in 1935 it's a film about escaping your present to find a better future. It tries very hard to feel like a Malick film but it doesn't have the strength of character to reach those lofty heights. Eugene is the central character, a young man who dreams. He lives with his family, mother, sister and an uncaring step-father. Enter Allison Wells, a glamourous bank robber on the run who is also dreaming of a better future. When she takes refuge in the family barn Eugene offers to help, drawing him into a dangerous game. The film looks beautiful thanks to the setting, which is actually filmed in New Mexico. But my main issue is that it probably needed to be longer. We needed to dig deeper into the drama and the characters. I never really felt truly connected at all. Mainly as Eugene, played by Finn Cole didn't really convince. Margot Robbie as Allison did however, a truly great presence on screen. In the end I felt like this film never delivers on its promise. Worthwhile but an opportunity lost."
Dreamland,59,65,audience,"I am bored , the story not strong. but Margot Robbie has good performance"
Dreamland,59,65,audience,"Out in cinemas in the UK on Friday 11th of December (if you can find one open), Dreamland stars Finn Cole and Margot Robbe in a dust bowl romance thriller that sees a bank robber (Robbie) take refuge in a family's barn only for the son (Cole) to fall in love with her and assist her getaway, having initially signed on to try and apprehend her for a large bounty.

As You Are (2016) director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte elicits an engrossing atmosphere from Nicolaas Zwart's story, set during the tumultuous dust bowl era for American farming, which saw hordes of families ruined by the impact of the weather on their crops. Much like The Grapes of Wrath, Dreamland, as the name suggests, is directly linked to the idea of the American Dream during this period and explores the delicate balance between good and evil when it comes to surviving the harsh realities of life in the U.S. of A.


Finn Cole brings an extraordinary amount of pathos to the role of Eugene, whom we meet at the beginning of the film as a ""kid"" stealing comics and too afraid to talk to girls. The coming-of-age aspect to the story sees him grow up real fast once introduced to the foul-mouthed outlaw Allison Wells - with an on-point performance by Margot Robbie who relishes the character's opposition to social norms of the period. There is a brilliant chemistry between the two central performers and audiences with a penchant for classic crime capers like Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) will cherish the intelligent blend of romance, crime, and drama. 


Travis Fimmel is sadly underused, playing Eugene's weathered step-dad. His rage at his step-son's behaviour lacks potency and threat, coming across as lifeless as his character's crops. Darby Camp puts in a decent turn, The Christmas Chronicles actor giving a hearty portrayal as Eugene's sister and her adult voice provides the narration to the piece - adding to the nostalgic quality. 


As a contribution to the ongoing narrative surrounding the American Dream, Dreamland offers little in the way of original takes. The film's themes of growing up during a depression-era are heartfelt but familiar, and the modern relevance of them is questionable. Is this something viewers will find compatible with their current lives? Relating to characters who turn to crime in order to survive harsh times has been done but the methodology here seems quaint and may struggle to connect with a 2020 audience whose concerns are unlikely to be solved by becoming a bank robber and fleeing to Mexico. 


Most of the scenes are low-key except for one dust storm whereby Fimmel attempts to get to the barn where Robbie hides out, which was compellingly suffocating. There is a use of stabbing cuts to innocuous visuals/memories like the ocean, or a piano, which are used to jolt the viewer, accompanied by sharp sound design. This added an unpredictable dimension to the film which, for the most part, lent intrigue. The strength of the movie lies in the commanding performances by Finn and Robbie though, whose unorthodox relationship makes for refreshing viewing given the period and plays out like a desperate search for freedom in the land of the free, regardless of the time."
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
Even Margot Robbie's ability to lift a movie has its limits, which Dreamland tests.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
While Nicholaas Zwart's screenplay isn't completely up to par with the film's visuals and performances, Dreamland is an impressive film.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
Without Robbie, Dreamland would be relatively forgettable, but with her - as with so much of her work - this otherwise milquetoast film becomes something if not memorable exactly, then certainly very enjoyable.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
Composer Patrick Higgins' dissonant soundtrack also won't be for everyone, but as Dreamland builds towards its predictable finale, the visuals and Robbie ensure it's a ride that's never dull.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
It's not clear if this wants to be a coming-of-age movie, a love story or a traditional outlaw tale with a twist. Less Dreamland, more snoozefest.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
The cinematography of this film is certainly its strongest point. More than ably bringing to life the dusty milieu of this part of Texas during the 1930s, the expanse of the vistas as well as Margot Robbie's blue eyes.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
Its script fails to engage as much as it should, leaving what could have been a sweeping affair more an average fling that leaves little impression
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
Margot Robbie (the actor) is the best thing in this but I'm not sure it's a project that Margot Robbie (the producer) should have green lit in the first place.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
The pair's attempted escape to Mexico is a routine tale, and Miles Joris-Peyrafitte's film adds pretentious narration...
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
Eugene and Allison eventually bond, snog and hit the road for a climactic rampage, but it's too little too late in a movie that has countless artful frames and not a moment of authenticity.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
Overall, Dreamland heavily relies on Robbie to succeed. But despite her efforts, she is unable to save this dull outlaw drama.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
The film has misunderstood the appeal of its cinematic pedigree by overthinking it, melding Bonnie and Clyde and Badlands into a static blur jammed on pause.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
Instead [Joris-Peyrafitte] spends so long framing it as the story of a comic-book-reading teenage boy obsessed with his long-absent father that watching it feels like queuing up for a dull theme park ride into the past.

Perhaps not as eventful as you'd hope given the subject matter, Dreamland still largely feels like a class act...
 "

The movie sets out to make Robbie a rock star but doesn't give her a tune; it wants to say something about sex and violence but ends up tongue tied.
 "

Despite Robbie's considerable efforts, boredom is the chief characteristic of Dreamland.
 "
Dreamland,59,65,critic,"
Despite some flaws, including that aforementioned narration and some subpar costuming and set design that screams low-budget to the point of being distracting, Dreamland works as a vehicle for Margot Robbie's substantial star power.

With its gorgeous cinematography, haunting score, careful pacing, evocative use of cross-cutting, and great performance from Margot Robbie, this is one of the best movies of 2020.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,audience,"'Eternal Beauty' is too often a portrait of cruelty, and not enough kindness.  It is, however, a showcase for the tremendous talents of Sally Hawkins.  At times, I wanted to scratch my eyeballs out, but it's beautiful.  For me, it just wasn't successful at managing the balance that writer and director Craig Roberts was shooting for.  Final Score: 5/10"
Eternal Beauty,77,68,audience,"Overcompensates for lack of visionary thesis with creative meanderings and wokish self-congratulations, but pretty well meaning and executed nonetheless.  An aggressively neurdivergent Amelie type-deal."
Eternal Beauty,77,68,audience,"Eternal Beauty's comical depiction of a woman who suffers from a mental health condition is already walking a very fine line, which it quickly falls over onto the wrong side of and doesn't manage to save itself."
Eternal Beauty,77,68,audience,"Awesome, original and well-acted.
Sally´s brighter than ever."
Eternal Beauty,77,68,audience,"A little difficult at first, but it is well worth the time and money. The film is seen entirely through the POV of Jane (Sally Hawkins), a paranoid schizophrenic, who sees her world entirely in the present, in a sort of chaotic, non-chronological manner. Sally Hawkins so completely inhabits her character that the mood shifts and hallucinatory scenes pulled me into Jane's mind and heart so readily that I was won over. I highly recommend Eternal Beauty."
Eternal Beauty,77,68,audience,"Sally Hawkins performance in this movie is by far the best I’ve seen from any actress in all of 2020 . Idk if she has award buzz around her but she certainly should 4.0. Very sweet film with great character development that had you rooting for the lead to turn her life around and find happiness . One last note to end on, screw that mother ."
Eternal Beauty,77,68,audience,"The movie successfully gives us an incredible look about schizophrenia and how it is misunderstood by many and the stigma around it, it made me understand the character, beautifully portrayed by the sublime Sally Hawkins who never fails to amaze with her acting methods. It's a great mix altogether and never goes for the cliches. It's a well done and well directed film."
Eternal Beauty,77,68,audience,"Good Lord. Yes, brilliant performances all around. But the LAST thing I wanted to see right now is a painful look at Schizophrenia.  There was no relief in sight for this poor girl, nor her messed-up family. It was a long meditation on internal pain. I'm sorry, I'm sure as a study of painful mental illness and family dysfunction, it was extremely well done, but as I said, Good Lord --- this was NOT the kind of film that even teaches a good lesson --- she comes to some sort of self-acceptance and dismissal of the chief phantom causing her pain (the boyfriend who jilted her at the alter) at the end, but wow, such a long and grindingly painful film. Whew."
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
The performance by Sally Hawkins as an English woman living with schizophrenia helps to better communicate what it's like to live with mental illness.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
It's not a perfect film by any means and definitely not for all audiences, but there is plenty in it to appreciate, including Roberts's good intentions.
 "

Eternal Beauty is full of extremely talented people who aren't quite sure what they're doing.

 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"

 "

While the storyline and message are not solid across the board, Eternal Beauty is nonetheless an enjoyable film with admirable intentions, elevated by the sensitive work of Hawkins and her supporting cast.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
Preserve the mystery or examine the motives, but showing the same mistakes made over and over again and expecting emotional resonance feels like the definition of inanity.
 "

The tone is darkly comedic, and that's the thing that makes it difficult. It's also the thing that makes it special. But the balancing act is so strange...not wholly successful but it is trying something.

As a visual and audio experience, Eternal Beauty is simply stunning.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"

 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
In the end... it's mainly the Sally Hawkins show and she encapsulates the bittersweet nature that Eternal Beauty possesses.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
Roberts keeps easy conclusions to a minimum, refusing to box Jane into territory verging on uplifting or inspirational. His approach to her mental state is a complex one, with medications easing Jane's pain but not ending it.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
A frothy comedy about laid-back people.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
This certainly isn't comfort cinema, but it's impressive filmmaking with a cathartic kick.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
Hawkins is masterly, as always, in a role that demands she calibrate her energy differently in almost every scene.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
A commendable performance from Sally Hawkins once again employs an empathetic nuance which assists in an authentic portrayal of what it feels like from her character's perspective.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
A completely original way to deal with mental health issues.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
While Roberts constructs a film that overflows with style and creativity, the uneven tone keeps Eternal Beauty from reaching the ambitious heights it aims for.
 "
Eternal Beauty,77,68,critic,"
A bold but jarring piece of film-making.
 "

The showy, self-conscious direction draws attention to itself and dilutes what might otherwise have been an absorbing narrative.

The Half of It,97,81,audience,"RATING: A-  Director: Alice Wu
The Half of It fully convinces as a funny and very original Coming of Age story. The two Leads, whose characters couldn't be more different, are great together on Screen. Alice Wu's Direction and Screenwriting are great and the Cinematography is really good. All in all this was straight out one of the best Coming of Age films from last year and it might even be on the list at the end of the decade."
The Half of It,97,81,audience,sweet story with great cinematography 
The Half of It,97,81,audience,"This movie was horrible. As an Asian American I was excited to see what they would do with an Asian lead. The representation was there, but the on screen chemistry/storytelling was horrible. The  male character may be a side character, but the way they wrote him was awful. This male character was dumb as bricks, and I feel like a dog could have replaced the role. Besides the lead of the movie we have no insights on any other characters. It becomes a one sided typical crush story, and even the ""crush"" was downright a boring love interest. These letters are how we are supposed to understand where these characters come from, but they do nothing but give us surface level details. I really wanted this to be good, but I was heavily disappointed."
The Half of It,97,81,audience,"This film was pretty ok! The plot was a good spin on the whole love triangle trope that's been done to death. I loved the main actress and thought everyone was pretty good. I wish the characters were a bit more interesting though, I feel like they really missed chances to dive into their backgrounds fully. The ending was kinda messy, felt a little too rushed and somehow both over and under written. Like the dialogue and metaphors were a little much and felt too try hard to be deep. But overall I liked the cast, the story, the pacing; if only the characters, script, and the cinematography was a bit better."

Ellie seemed to be closed off and opens up but her friends seemingly abandon her and she has no reaction. White boy is annoying throughout and I hated him, and his development wasn't great imo, Aster seems confused but never shows it more than ""I don't know what to do.. ill do this"" and it doesn't come up again. I see many good aspects but I cant truly enjoy it because I cant relate to the characters."

Whether you were the jock, the nerd, or the popular kid, there's something in this movie that just might make you feel pretty darn seen.
 "
The Half of It,97,81,critic,"
An honest story which contains a lot of topics beyond romance. It speaks of self-love, of growing up, accepting oneself, friendship and more. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Half of It,97,81,critic,"
The Half of It is a much-needed, witty boost to the genre of romantic comedies, which have been struggling for years with mediocre and uninspired stories.

 "
The Half of It,97,81,critic,"
The Half of It, new today, seems like something of a remedy to that - an undeniably but not tokenistically progressive affair from writer-director Alice Wu about a queer love triangle in the small, simple town of Squahamish.
 "
The Half of It,97,81,critic,"
A warm hearted, funny and really well-crafted movie about two girls, one boy, love letters and the art of romantic texting.
 "
The Half of It,97,81,critic,"
The Half of It actually manages to make its characters' expectations in the wake of that big scene feel genuine.
 "
The Half of It,97,81,critic,"
Well-conceived and superbly written quirky coming-of-age story.
 "
The Half of It,97,81,critic,"
There's a generosity of spirit here that is increasingly a feature of teenage dramas as writers and directors move away from stereotypes to more complex characters.
 "
The Half of It,97,81,critic,"
Compassionate and emotionally universal, Alice Wu's film understands several very particular teen experience: Falling in love, adolescent dignity, and thinking you're the only brain in town.
 "
The Half of It,97,81,critic,"
All three characters...bring a realism to the traditional teen romance that reminds audiences that sometimes, the happily ever after can be delivered in a different way. And in the case of The Half of It, it makes it all the sweeter.

Happiest Season,82,76,audience,"I'm happy they're getting inclusive with Christmas movies. It was fun. A few laughs here and there, and definitely some relatable moments didn't compensate for the exaggerated, stereotypical tone of it all. KStew, stay away from comedies (please)."
Happiest Season,82,76,audience,"On the twelfth day of Christmas

Happiest Season,82,76,audience,I liked the performances of Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis. VERY GOOD MOVIE. They're very beautifuls. Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis deserve an Oscar award for their performances. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
Happiest Season,82,76,audience,"Really enjoyed this show.   So many good characters.  Great writing.  For me it is just a half Star behind Family Stone for a stressful, yet chock full of love Christmas movie."
Happiest Season,82,76,audience,"a cheesy lesbian christmas movie??? everything i've ever wanted, i'm so happy"
Happiest Season,82,76,audience,"A delightful holiday romcom.

Happiest Season is a nice LGBT twist on the romcom format. Though the cast is chock-full of A-listers, the film felt a bit too surface level. But it's a romcom, what do you expect?

The plot is upfront right away. It's an LGBT movie about... well, I won't spoil. But it's an uncomfortable topic for many. The audience has no doubt about the plot upfront. All while having a few laughs between.

Abby (Kristen Stewart) does an amazing role starring in this film as she plays a believable lover in conflict. We emphasize the struggle that she faces throughout the movie. 

The movie moves fast from an idea to Harper's (Mackenzie Davis) house and conservative family. Though the family is a plot device to introduce conflict, they felt a bit too contrived and artificial. Comic relief is too obvious and forced in some places. Though no fault of the actors, more could have been done to the script.

Every character has their own hidden secrets and conflicts. For better or worse, they must face these consequences later. This aspect of the film was appreciated as it gave more character development for everyone.

Yet, by the third act, the hidden secrets seem to have little to no consequences for everyone. The third act felt rushed and contrived. 

Thankfully, the cast of A-listers carried this movie. Everyone who watched this movie will stan Aubrey Plaza. She did an amazing job, but Dan Levy, Allison Brie, Victor Garber, among others deserve their own praise. All had stellar performances and did the best that they could with the script.

It's a good watch with some genuine moments and highlights. Even with all the positives, I can't bring myself to feel at ease with the ending. If you went through all the struggles that the protagonist suffers in this movie, how would you feel? Sure characters are happy in the short term, there are some real underlying relationship issues that aren't answered. This is true within Abby/Harper's relationship as well as the larger family.

3/5. You want an LGBT friendly holiday romcom film, this is it. It's a good idea with sloppy execution. The entire package leaves more to be desired."
Happiest Season,82,76,audience,"That was the biggest rip off of Family Stone I have ever seen.  Literally stole every single scene, but added poor actors and bad dialogue and a bunch of making out.  Love Dan Levy, just hated the movie - BECAUSE IT WAS STOLEN!!!  And not well!!!"
Happiest Season,82,76,audience,Love this movie!! Fell in love with the storyline! Love how it connects with what's happening in culture today!
Happiest Season,82,76,audience,"The was nothing comedic about this romantic comedy and there wasn't a whole lot romantic about it either. Instead it was a mess of horrible people being horrible to each other (and others who are not horrible). Whether or not Harper can be excused for forcing Abby to pretend to be straight, her other behavior was inexcusable and she simply didn't deserve to be treated as one of the romantic leads. The movie then culminated by sweeping years of abuse under the rug after a single argument and round of apologizes and pretending that everyone could just suddenly be one big, happy family. 

I do not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh, looking to feel good, or looking for a realistic take on how abuse can affect people."
Happiest Season,82,76,audience,Wish there were more films like this
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
[T]he film misses the opportunity to queer the holiday romance genre itself, by shifting the expectations of the form and asserting that a happy ending need not be the conventional romantic one.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
Proving a conservative format can change is well and good, but there's also something to be said for just leaving it behind.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
It's the movie equivalent of one of those specialty caffeinated holiday drinks like a Toasted White Chocolate Mocha or a Chestnut Praline Latte - a guilty pleasure filled with sweetness and warmth, but also an abundance of empty calories.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
Is the movie full of every cliché in the book? Yes. But because it takes place during my beloved Christmas season, and because it's got Davis at its center, I went with it.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
With Happiest Season, the LGBTQ+ community may have reached cinematic quality in one key aspect. Now it too has its own average-to-bad romcom of the sort that the straight community has been churning out for decades.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
When I tell you that Happiest Season is the quintessential holiday rom-com sure to be revisited for decades to come, please believe me as I don't deliver that lightly.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
Watching ""Happiest Season"" is like opening the wrong present on Christmas morning: You're a little bummed out and it's too late to put it back in the box.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
All too frequently the actresses seem smarter than the material, forced to navigate preposterous twists and increasingly silly plot complications.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
A fun but very calculated confection.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
It's a feel-good movie to put you in the holiday spirit and that really does make for the happiest season.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
Happiest Season doesn't add much to the already stoked holiday season romances and just paddles along with a conventional narrative without doing much to overtake the notions.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
An extremely pleasant movie, and an excellent pick for a lazy afternoon holiday watch.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
...a bright, witty, engaging family comedy that should have been a counter-programming hit circa Xmas 2020...
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
There's a constant tension between the movie's desire to embrace cliches and to deepen them.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
The supporting cast elevates every scene they're in, distracting from the less successful main plot.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
With a bleach-blond Kristen Stewart and Christmas music galore, it sets itself apart from other Christmas movies by featuring a romance between two women.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
It's totally just fine. It's fine! It's fine.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
Great rom-coms can circumvent flaws if they deliver on the joy, the cosiness, and the chemistry, and DuVall's film offers a generous helping of all three.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
really wanted to like 'Happiest Season.' On the one hand, there should be more inclusive titles in every genre, including holiday. On the other hand, inclusivity alone doesn't make a film great or even all that good.
 "
Happiest Season,82,76,critic,"
Happiest Season is a solid addition to the legions of heteronormative Christmas movies. Had Harper been a more engaging character or if it focused on what sets it apart from other holiday films, it might have been a great one.
 "
The High Note,70,71,audience,"A prime example of something completely formulaic being elevated by the look, the performances, and the MUSIC that this film in particular employs. 

Dakota Johnson is slowly, but surely climbing to the top of the most affable ""movie stars"" (if there is such a thing these days) whose presence alone makes one want to spend time with a film. 

What I really loved about The High Note though, was how it really focused on the creation and recording process of the music. Most music biopics aren't even wise enough to know to focus more on the ""why"" and ""how"" of the music its subject created rather than their personal lives, but this fictional tale not only puts emphasis on how the music comes to be, but realizes what it takes to bring melodies earth-side. The catharsis that comes with listening to Aretha here is tangible. 

The whole idea of having Tracee Ellis Ross play this superstar singer who is at least physically modeled after her mother is pretty fantastic as well. Kudos to whoever cracked that bit of casting."
The High Note,70,71,audience,"I liked it. Tracee Ellis Ross was really great. I thought her singing and acting were superb. I was surprised. The rest of the cast was also good. Kelvin had a wonderful voice too. Movies like this have been done before but this had a really good sound track. Dakota Johnson was good but at times a little lack of emotion where I thought there could be more.
I recommend this as a musical comedy/drama."
The High Note,70,71,audience,Made for TV level movie with a dislikable protagonist and overall collection of despicable characters.  I did not like or relate to any of them and the storyline just drawled along like a bad blues song.  Nothing to like in this slush of a movie.
The High Note,70,71,audience,I missed the movie when it was released because of Covid.  I ended up watching it on HBO and I gave The High Note 3.5 before I watched it again.  I like it even better the second time.  This is a feel good movie.  Not all movies have to deal with a moral dilemma.  Johnson is a very underrated actress and Ross plays her part perfectly.  The scenes between them are golden.
The High Note,70,71,audience,Dakota doesn't come across as a musician in any way - so The High Note misses all along the way.  The formula isn't anything new or the music anything to write home about...but it's a decent sunday afternoon flick.
The High Note,70,71,audience,"Such a great, music filled, feel good movie."
The High Note,70,71,audience,"This was an excellent movie. It had highs and lows. It had great music and a great script. Loved Tracee Ellis Ross. She really did her heritage proud. Ice Cube brought great levity. Dakota Johnson... she's doing her thing. Loved this show. Everyone added to the movie. If you haven't watched it, watch it."
The High Note,70,71,audience,How many days of your life are you willing to sacrifice waiting for a plot line? If you enjoyed this film you clearly had a good nights sleep. At just under 2 hours it feels like a brief 28 hours of waiting tor Dakota to cut those bangs. Acting was good but script was terrible. Just finished War and Peace while rewatching.
The High Note,70,71,audience,"Worst sound mixing ever. Vocals are too low, or music is too high. Watching at home I had to constantly adjust the volume. The movie was less than so-so."
The High Note,70,71,audience,Non substantial.  Like a beach book.
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
The most frustrating aspect of The High Note is how long it takes for it to make real use of the talents of Tracee Ellis Ross.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
...manages to examine the difficulties in finding and developing musical direction without revelling in too many industry clichés...
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
The High Note deserves plaudits for telling a female-centric story with women who do more than just pine after men. But it never seems to know exactly what to do with its characters, and winds up spinning its wheels for most of its running time.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
It may not be anything revolutionary even for its genre, but it's an above-average feel-good summer film.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
The High Note is a pleasant enough diversion as a story of empowerment, but doesn't have enough range to make it memorable.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
You know what? This thing is sweetly affable even at its silliest.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
Like a ... pop song that leaves your head the second it's over, The High Note is pleasant enough while you're experiencing it, but it refuses to linger after the credits roll.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
A frank L.A. drama about the music industry and the careful tightrope legends must walk. Ross is a standout, even if Johnson's protagonist is a mite insubstantial.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
The High Note doesn't tick every box but it's easy to watch and easy to enjoy.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
While Maggie eventually proves her competence as a producer, there's no attempt to suggest that her work is especially brilliant or groundbreaking. Nor could any claim remotely like that be made for The High Note. But all goes down easy.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
It's a shame The High Note is too busy honey-coating its chase-your-dream production to let those messy emotions unravel up in the mix.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
The High Note has both soul and smarts.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
Sways to its own charming beat, elevated by the ensemble on hand who push the tropes beyond their familiarity.

Tracee Ellis Ross really, really does her thing...even Ice Cube gave us something a little bit different...

The High Note,70,71,critic,"
for all its familiarities, there is so much unexpected joy and refreshing brilliance within the film that I can't help but sing its praises proudly.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
The High Note is a pleasant and unsurprising stroll through the music industry. It allows you to peer through a window into this world without allowing you to get to know anyone inside.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
The plot turns are easily anticipated. But Ellis Ross and Johnson chime well together, and the script has enough tart wit (much of it delivered with Ellis Ross's throaty chuckle) to compensate for the slight story.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
Disappointing.
 "
The High Note,70,71,critic,"
First of all, the music in The High Note is quite good.

The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,audience,"I kinda enjoyed the sappy story line and the characters while I forced myself to suspend my disbelief, but was feeling pretty uncomfortable with it being set in New York when it could have been set in any big city. I kept feeling like it was some Danes and Canadians scorning the state of  homelessness and domestic violence in America, when it's not their story to tell. It's not my story either as an Aussie, but I know they glossed over a lot of the reality of homelessness, abused families and the fear of the system failing you. They used very real and traumatic experiences to serve their fictional story that a little kindness fixes everything. By distorting a modern day tragic reality to make a fairy tail, they are doing a diservice to the people they were pretending to represent on screen. It could have made a good story with a little more thought put into how they represented the topic, and the more realistic way that kindness does actually help change people's lives."
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,audience,"Good movie. I enjoyed it. Not too heavy, but very engaging.
Well acted and a good story."
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,audience,"This movie was excellent with stellar performances and a great cast. Some of these actors I didn’t know, but this movie had a perfect blend of tragedy, depression, comedy, and “ahhh” moments. The critics really blew it on this one. Please do not trust what they say. You have to watch it. It satisfies the soul."
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,audience,"There are a few forced moments, and the end wraps up a little too neatly, but I still really enjoyed this movie. I bought into the cast, and it offered an opportunity to experience a different perspective. One of the critics called it a tearjerker that doesn't produce tears. I was actually sobbing at a few parts."
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,audience,"Never listen to critics. This is a FANTASTIC movie! The casting, story and shooting are all brilliant. Also great to see Jay Barachel come into his own. Go see this movie!!!"
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,audience,"I think the critics got it wrong this time. If you don't find yourself caring for these characters, check your pulse. This film captures the unexpected and unwanted complexities of life. It can be at times both harrowing and depressing, but also absurd, warm, eccentric and inspiring. Life has both  synchronicities and random occurrences, sorry that the critics are unwilling to accept either that or human affection. I didn't find this film to be tweet, I found the mother's protection of her children's childhood to be , heroic seems to large, but the strain and effort is apparent. I appreciate the superb casting, the performances and the slow coming together of a tribe of friends. Kindness and friendship can heal."
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,audience,The world needs TONS of kindness.
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,audience,This is an incredibly moving film.  Not sure why RT rates it so low - it blew me away.
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,audience,"Compelling characters, a few really good individual performances, and many gritty scenes. Director lets the scenes breathe. Thankfully we never have to fuss over too many late details, then it's a satisfying ending."
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,audience,"This is the best movie I've seen in a while. Not shying away from issues of domestic violence and homelessness but wrapping them up into a beautiful film showcasing how people are supposed to look after each other. This film has touching moments, drama, romance and humour"

 "
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"
The biggest problem is the jumbled and hackneyed screenplay that has little regard for viewers' intelligence ... It's just not a very good movie, and you won't feel much sympathy for the characters who make very bad decisions.
 "
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"
As the cinematic equivalent of a self-help seminar, this heavy-handed ensemble drama of redemption and rebirth is hopelessly melodramatic.
 "
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"
The best thing about The Kindness of Strangers is that it is very much a product of our current situation when it comes to the chaotic state of the world we live in. Sometimes we get the downer movies we deserve.
 "
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"

A syrupy brew thick with twee and an abundance of cringe-inducing moments pulling at heartstrings.

The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"
""The Kindness of Strangers"" is a mixed bag, though it's led by a wonderful performance by Zoe Kazan. In the end, she does manage to drag this film across the finish line.

This isn't on a par with Scherfig's best films, but the milieu and situations are immersive and the characters just colorful enough to hold our interest.

The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"
The Kindness of Strangers has a rather weightless feel, often at odds with its heavy subject matter. Warmheartedness can only get you so far.
 "
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"
The themes in Strangers are writ-large across the screen - be kinder to one another. And that's it really.
 "
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"
As befitting its title, the characters with which Lone Scherfig populates The Kindness of Strangers prove the shining emotional heart of the drama.
 "
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"
Every new idea shouts loud, in absurd and unnatural dialogue, leaving nothing more than a sense of confusion and flat-out deflation.
 "
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"
The movie, so determined to celebrate small acts of kindness among those who have least, feels a little too calculated and emphatic - a tearjerker that doesn't quite draw tears.
 "
The Kindness of Strangers,17,65,critic,"
A problem here is that almost all the characters are victims.
 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,audience,"The Last Vermeer is about the art world in Holland at the end of WWII, and people adjusting to peace after five years of Nazi occupation.  It is one of the few movies that addresses the extensive world of art forgery.  The film is a little slow in developing, and maintains that pace throughout.  The cinematography is artistic. Director Dan Friedkin accomplished exactly what he set out to do.  He made a thoughtful, well constructed movie about a culturally important historical event which targets a relatively small segment of movie viewers.  This movie probably isn't for everyone, but it's still a good movie."
The Last Vermeer,69,91,audience,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Based on a true story, the movie begins in 1945, 3 weeks before the fall of Hitler's Reich. The movie is also based on Jonathan Lopez's 2008 book The Man Who Made Vermeers: Unvarnishing the Legend of Master Forger Han van Meegeren.

Dan Friedkin makes his directorial debut in The Last Vermeer. He actually played a stunt pilot in the movie DUNKIRK.

I'm always completely amazed when another movie set in World War II tells an intriguing story I've never heard about until now!

THINGS I LIKED:
I think the first time I saw Guy Pierce in a movie it was The Count Of Monte Cristo. I immediately liked him and have enjoyed all of his performances. In this movie, he plays a Dutchman named Han van Meegeren, a painter and art dealer. Some say Guy Pierce's performance was over-the-top, while others view his overacting as an actual interpretation of a man who was probably very flamboyant, eccentric, and even insecure.
You get to travel to Amsterdam! You really get a feeling of what Holland would have looked and felt like after the war. The costume design, set pieces, and backdrops are fantastic and gorgeous. This is the kind of movie you feel a little bit more cultured after watching it, simply because it revolves around European art.
I liked the bird's eye views in various scenes.
I love it when you can read more about the story on the end screen before the final credits. Such an interesting story about the most successful forger in history. Keep watching when the movie is over!
Lovely music by Johan Soderqvist, which scoops you up from the very beginning.
There's a lot of ""grey"" area in how viewers will interpret this film. I always like that because it gets interesting conversations going!
Many of the frames look like artistic masterpieces themselves.
There are some great contrasts of characters that illustrate how people rationalized lowering or changing their values and standards during the terrible conditions of World War II. What would YOU be willing to do to survive?
The story is filled with rich tension.
This is a very good film that has absolutely flown under the radar for most people. If you love historical drama, the World War II time period, and true stories, I think you'll really enjoy this!

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The European accents are hit and miss.
The movie is kind of split into two parts: the courtyard drama and everything else. Some will prefer the scenes in court, while others will want to spend more time with the characters outside the legalese.
Act I moves a little slowly and then the film picks up speed in Act 2. Act 3 could have ended earlier with a very different vibe than how it actually ended. There's a bit of an after-story with a twist. Look to see where you might have ended the story if you had been the director!

TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Children will be bored and won't understand the history or complicated politics. In theaters, you'll see an audience of mostly older viewers, which is a shame because there is some interesting stuff to learn in this film!
Profanity and F-bombs
You see a firing squad killing people in two different scenes.
Men get into a violent brawl.

The Last Vermeer,69,91,audience,"This film was a very engaging, complex, and enjoyable movie! The film takes one from loving the central character to detesting him.  He was using a cunning deception for a greater good... or was he? The acting, settings, and direction were all great!

The Last Vermeer,69,91,audience,Great storyline and good acting made this movie a must see. The historical facts made this very interesting.
The Last Vermeer,69,91,audience,"The Last Vermeer was totally worth the trip to the theater. Despite the story already well known and documented,  The Last Vermeer is able to bring off an entertaining retelling.  Guy Pierce does his usual thing by morphing into character with flair and style. Excellent acting does not stop there with engaging and enjoyable performance by the supporting cast as well. I am going to see The Last Vermeer at least one more time. Though the courtroom scene fleshed out tricks, the setup and demonstration has more than a few things I will find during the rewatch.  I paid $13.50 for my ticket in California SF Bay Area. Though the Cinemark screen in Daly City had two technical problems (reported),  The Last Vermeer overcame the presentation issues and provide a satisfying movie experience."
The Last Vermeer,69,91,audience,Very good movie based on real events. Another one that shows that what happens in real life can be more incredible than fiction.
The Last Vermeer,69,91,audience,A good movie.  A complicated plot that unfolds over the course of the story.  A thinking person's movie.

 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,critic,"
It is interesting to me when a filmmaker takes a subject which has been investigated many times and brings a new angle to it. Here director Dan Friedkin brings us a story, based on real events, of how World War II and art intermingled.
 "

Its examination of what makes a work of art worthy of everlasting praise and who gets to decide that it is proves to be tasty food for thought.

Friedkin and his screenwriting team... have trouble deciding whose movie this really is. ... Friedkin can't seem to choose, leaving a muddled mess between them.
 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,critic,"
Post-WWII drama paints intriguing but mature picture.
 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,critic,"
The underrated Guy Pierce is the highlight as the Dutch artist on trial for treason during WW2, a rich story vein in which another amazing based-on-true emerges. Viva Vermeer!
 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,critic,"
By far the most enjoyable aspect of the film is Pearce's overripe performances as van Meegeren, with an assist from Olivia Grant, acidly sensual as the painter's model/mistress.
 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,critic,"
An entertaining if uneven mixture of post-World War II fact and fiction.
 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,critic,"
[Claes] Bang and a realistic supporting cast are very good, but it's Guy Pearce as van Meegeren that you really want to see.
 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,critic,"
The film's triumph is not its reintroduction of van Meegeren to the world, though that is commendable. Instead, it's the conversation it fosters about art itself.
 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,critic,"
A film that more than paints in broad strokes in capturing a moment in Dutch history in which an artful dodger successfully bet it all in going for Baroque.
 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,critic,"
The majority of the tale -- which is compelling in itself -- is played out with a sombre and dutiful seriousness (Bang included) which undermines its complex underpinnings of intrigue.
 "
The Last Vermeer,69,91,critic,"
It plays as if it was a conventional mystery picture.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,audience,"A dramatic, yet soft romantic story with implicit overtones built on the traumatic intersection of transsexualism and illegal immigration. A quiet movie with a message that is best felt rather than explained."
Lingua Franca,86,58,audience,"Moved a bit too slowly, but watching the relationship dance was interesting.  As was the ICE dance."
Lingua Franca,86,58,audience,"Isabel Sandoval wrote, directed, produced and starred in a film about an undocumented trans Filipino caregiver who pursues a marriage to obtain a green card.  First off, can we all be thankful that movies from diverse voices are being given a platform more and more frequently?  As much as that means to me, it doesn't excuse the filmmaker from being sloppy and leaving wide gaps in the story that don't make the film feel authentic.  There are several great ideas here, but mixed together they work as well as oil and water.  People are too reactionary which defies logic considering how quickly and forced these conflicts and resolutions are.  While we have to accept the fact that this is a first-time filmaker, we can't just forgive the movie's faults out of sympathy.  This is a story that needs to be SPOT on and not only engaging, but lose the viewer.  Instead, I was left wondering why certain characters after being developed, just vanished.  A trans woman who takes care of an elderly woman with dementia, combined with a romance of her grandson combined with that evil character who just seems drawn to scale.  I hope Sandoval gets another chance because she shows so much promise.  I just wish there had been another pass or two at a largely invisible script.  Trans voices are a necessity in film and this is worthy of a watch for the sole fact it treats the typically voiceless with dignity and respect.  I just wish it was a better film. Finally, I caught this on Netflix and may I suggest how to watch?  There are two ways and considering there are three languages used, I strongly suggest using captions.  Now, this is going to be annoying because there's no way just to caption the two foreign languages to the English speakers and instead you get captioned EVERY word that's said and EVERY move that's heard.  Considering the movie starts and ends in a language other than English.. you're just gonna have to show a little bit of trust.  The scene at the beginning is integral to the film.  Final Score: 5.8/10"
Lingua Franca,86,58,audience,"Very, very slow movie. Don't bother."
Lingua Franca,86,58,audience,"S**t, this was a great movie.  A movie about people, not a bunch of made up drama to get people to watch.  This movie was much better than I expected, and I loved it.  Original everything, so interesting.  I have to agree more with the critics on this one."
Lingua Franca,86,58,audience,Well done!  Intelligent. Sensitive. I loved it!
Lingua Franca,86,58,audience,"Olivia (played by the director, Isabel Sandoval), a trans woman, is a Filipino undocumented immigrant in Brooklyn who is a caretaker for a lady who is suffering from dementia. As her options for getting a green card become fewer, she meets Alex, Olga's grandson, and a relationship develops between the two. I enjoyed this movie. It was nice seeing a film about a trans woman directed by a trans woman who plays the lead character in the film. There are two things I enjoyed most about the film. First, it is an interesting and believable character study of what it must be like to live in fear of immigration in America under the current president. The constant fear of someone tipping off immigration, or the risk of making a trip to the market, is always there. Second, while the relationship between Alex and Olivia was not always very believable, when it was, it worked as a story of two people who are trying to make a better life for themselves. The sense of place and time was well executed; it reminded me in some ways of the films of Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart) in how the films capture people living on the margins and how much of a part of the fabric of life in the city they are. Thumbs up from me for a film that isn't perfect but one whose story is sensitively told and generally well-acted."
Lingua Franca,86,58,audience,A timely story about an undocumented transgender immigrant told by an auteur transgender immigrant.
Lingua Franca,86,58,audience,"Complex, beautiful film.  Held my interest as it navigated the typical experiences of romance and work while simultaneously exploring the rarely seen experience of being trans and undocumented."
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
A mesmerizing, often terrifying slice of social realism from a filmmaker in complete control of the world she's depicting.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
Ably performed all round, with a strong turn from [Isabel] Sandoval in the lead, this is a timely reflection on how it feels to be an outsider in the land of the free.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
The film is remarkable in how it focuses on people that we rarely see onscreen.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
In Lingua Franca, that villainization is replaced with empathy. Immigration is not constantly scrutinized, joked about, and shamed.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
The film inherits a symbolic baton from Chantal Akerman's News From Home in its deft and touching depiction of a woman almost entirely separated from her roots, tethered only by the words of her mother.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
It's also an empathic portrait of a man whose bid at redemption hinges on going against everything that Trump-era America stands for.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
Lingua Franca's power resides [in its depictions of] lost souls confronting impossible choices that pit their comfort against their humanity.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
This story has never been told before, communicated in this way or created by such an astute and perceptive writer/director/actor like Isabel Sandoval.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
Sandoval sells Olivia's perspective in brief and remarkable performance notes.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
LINGUA FRANCA is an important film, not just in the sense of representation, but also in the way it portrays the relationship between xenophobic and transphobic logics

Drama about undocumented woman has language, nudity.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
A real immigration story in the U.S.A.. A film made by trueness. A must. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
Lingua Franca is almost voyeuristic. With Sandoval spreading herself between acting, directing, writing, editing, and producing, the film is inherently intimate.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
The expression here is one of shared humanity regardless of background, gender identity, race or creed. The common language being used here is cinema.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
Lingua Franca might be a fictional film, but it accurately shows situations and feelings experienced by an untold number of transgender undocumented immigrants.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
It's beautifully underplayed, leaving the details in the mind of the viewer, which makes the film thoughtful but never preachy.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
Lingua Franca is painfully realist, and the ending is suitably realistic, with no easy answers or assurances of safety.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
The ending feels like a cop-out as the director keeps it predictably ambiguous. The movie takes a while to get going. And when we finally get invested in what happens to them, that ending does feel like a cheat.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
It may lack narrative urgency or progression, but it is firmly grounded in reality. This is not a soapy romance about love against all odds; it's a film that quietly traces the bleak, displaced, and unsatisfying lives at its centre.
 "
Lingua Franca,86,58,critic,"
With a delicate dramatic touch, Sandoval shows how Olivia's life is shaped by the tense political climate and her lack of options.

While there are plenty of formulaic moments here, what is the docs' strength is the moment when the curtain is pulled down. When we actually get to see the person. Not just the celebrity or performer.

Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,91,91,critic,"

I think there this movie has a lot of interesting things to say about fame, interesting things to say about how women are conditioned to be good and be nice and not make waves and get the approval of other people.
 "
Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,91,91,critic,"
I came away with a whole new appreciation for one of the most famous people on the planet.
 "
Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,91,91,critic,"
Will certainly appeal to Swifties, and will hopefully get those who are skeptical to think about her in a different light.
 "
Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,91,91,critic,"
It's a well-crafted work which reveals only as much as the camera-aware Swift chooses to reveal.
 "
Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,91,91,critic,"
As a music documentary, Miss Americana is straightforward, celebrating Swift as a ferociously gifted writer and lyricist, and reminding viewers of just how industry-dominating she is.
 "
Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,91,91,critic,"
'Miss Americana' offers a compelling and compassionate portrait of an extraordinarily talented woman who has grown up and remained remarkably unspoiled under the harshest possible spotlights.
 "
Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,91,91,critic,"
Going in a cynic, Swift - and Lane Wilson's film-making - won me over in the end. Bravo.

Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,91,91,critic,"
In the surprisingly thoughtful documentary ""Miss Americana,"" she has far more to say about it than just ""Flibberty Jib.""
 "
Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,91,91,critic,"
Wilson's film wants to sell us on her goodness rather than allowing it to shine through naturally which is a shame since it ultimately makes her seem even more like a product.

 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
While it isn't any sort of achievement in film-making, this documentary is a fitting tribute to a fantastic actress.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
The documentary Olympia is a lot like the Oscar-winning actress Olympia Dukakis herself -- opinionated, funny, candid, foul-mouthed, sometimes rambling, but never boring.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
Olympia proves the idea that you can point the camera at interesting people and an interesting film will likely result.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
Olympia is a master class on the skill and work ethic of a legendary actor that also offers a delicious glimpse into her lively spirit, sharp wit and steel spine.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
Without a more probing look into her artistry, it's hard to think of ""Olympia"" as a definitive Dukakis profile - though it's certainly an unusual celebrity documentary.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
Harry Mavromichalis' Olympia delivers a deeply personal and philosophical documentary, following Oscar-winning actress Olympia Dukakis over the course of several years.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
""Olympia"" for all its fondness, is just too cursory a portrait of a complex woman: depth presented as a series of glinting surfaces.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
[Olympia Dukakis'] disarming candour and abundant energy drive the documentary.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
It is a pleasure to spend time with Dukakis, who is always not just open to but hungry for revelation, growth, and connection, giving the documentary a deliciously buoyant quality.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
Actors aren't always as interesting as their performances.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
Director Harry Mavromichalis, using extreme close-ups that caress the stunning, dramatic topography of [Dukakis'] face, eschews traditional narration and chases after the firebrand as she attends the unveiling of her star on the walk of fame.
 "
Olympia,87,,critic,"
Rough around the edges, scrappy and and yet still illuminating documentary about Oscar-winning actor Olympia Dukakis.

Run,89,76,audience,"This is similar to the tv show “The Act”. Still thought it was a good movie, with a twist at the end."
Run,89,76,audience,"If I hadn't watched 'The Act', I think I would have rated it more, especially for Sarah Paulson's acting. The plot was similar, though it takes it a notch higher. Of course, one thing to note is that 'The Act' was a real story. But this movie became predictable even for people who were aware of that story because of the series that aired."
Run,89,76,audience,"incredible performance, so much raw talent in both sarah paulson and keira allen. especially (not a spoiler) the scene in the basement. it was so powerful, and i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good thriller"
Run,89,76,audience,This movie was so ridiculous i really don't know how it has high ratings. I suppose Helen Keller rose from the graves and rated it.
Run,89,76,audience,"This modern take on Stephen King's Misery knows what it is and it's a tense, tight and super fun thriller"
Run,89,76,audience,"Really Fun and Well Made
This was such a good thriller. I think it was one of the most effective ones that i have seen this year.

It was defiantly a fun, hour and a half popcorn fun movie but i think it was just that little bit extra too. The filmmaking was above that for me. It just had that little bit of extra care put into it and i think it made all the difference.

The acting was really great from both of the leads. I was really impressed with Kiera Allen. This was her debut film and i think this will net her even more roles because she was fantastic.

I found the score really great too. It really worked together with the script and filmmaking to really get you into the film. I appreciated it.

You should definitely watch this, its really fun, supper quick and well made."
Run,89,76,audience,"It was a fun, suspenseful movie - without any pretensions to be anything else :)"
Run,89,76,audience,"The first part of the film was very captivating and mysterious, the second unfortunately for me was a repetitive and boring."
Run,89,76,audience,"I watched this with my sugar daddy and I felt that this movie really grinded my hears in the best way possible. Sara paulson is quite the meme nowadays so i enjoyed her presence in this movie, however she played an evil rotten no-good bitch mom that stole a fucking child. anyways 10/10!!:))"
Run,89,76,audience,This movie was very good.
Run,89,76,critic,"
Chaganty fully commits to delivering breathless thrills and outrageous revelations, rather than lecturing us about the real-world implications.
 "

Oozes tension and reveals that keep you nervously tapping the entire runtime.
 "

Chaganty has achieved great things with his second feature, which is a must-see for those who love a good adrenaline rush.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
A campy thriller that pits [a woman] against her disabled teenage daughter in a battle of wits that isn't quite sharp enough.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
Run is a subpar genre piece with good intentions if nothing else.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
While utterly predictable, Run keeps its head above water thanks to some nimble filmmaking and a great debut performance by Allen. After this latest use of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, though, it might be time to retire that storytelling device.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
Clocking in at an economical 90 minutes, [Run] traverses through familiar beats, but its taut pacing and all-in performances elevate it well-above standard thriller fare.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
We marinate in the juiciest, briniest details and soak up the nail-biting, will-she-make-it moments.

 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
... this murky domestic thriller provides fair entertainment, stepping up what was presented in 2018 with the disappointing Searching.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
Run isn't a masterpiece, and the movie has some ideas that are recycled from other films, but it's a satisfying thriller for anyone intrigued by stories about one family member pitted against another.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
Run is a worthy follow-up to Searching for Chaganty, a director who knows how to ratchet up the tension when it counts.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
It's far from a terrible movie, but I'm not sure what the takeaway is meant to be.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
Aneesh Chaganty crucially recognized the potential issue of having able-bodied filmmakers tell a disabled story.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
Paulson will be fine after this misstep. Ditto Allen, who could not be a more appealing lead or a resourceful damsel-in-distress.
 "
Run,89,76,critic,"
A quick-paced thriller that gets right to the action. There is high tension throughout that will have you on the edge of your seat, with great performances by the two leads.

One of the most chilling things about Run is pondering just how many parents in the audience might sympathize with Diane a little and just how far into the movie they might get before that sympathy runs out.

...Run is one of those movies you recommend to friends...it feels like a personal discovery.

Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
A work of animated art and horror nostalgia tribute, Attack of the Demons is a remarkable film about demons rising in small town Colorado, and the three friends who confront them.
 "
Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
I feel terrible giving this a bad review because it is clear in every second how much time, effort, and love went into the production. But, none of that is enough to make Attack of the Demons enjoyable, let alone watchable.
 "
Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
A wittier script might have allowed that friends DIYing a horror cartoon vibe to translate into something more fun on the screen.
 "
Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
Clearly made as a low-budget labor of love, but it's also just a fine piece of horror/comedy lunacy.
 "
Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
This quick-moving tale grabs you visually and never lets you go, even though you pretty much know you know where it's going.
 "
Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
Attack of the Demons struggles with pacing, but succeeds as a uniquely animated and joyous love letter to 80s and early 90s body horror and demon attack movies.
 "
Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
Power's film is a fascinating slice of Nineties nostalgia viewed through a cardboard lens. But when the bodies hit the floor, you will wish for a little three-dimensional storytelling in this two-dimensional world.
 "
Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
Attack of the Demons deserves some praise for its look and its low-budget existence. That's about it.
 "
Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
Its style is truly impressive, as is the delight it takes in using that style to render an eye-popping series of monstrous demons and gory kills.
 "
Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
{T]he animation is overly simple and the voice acting is a bit bland, leading to a film that is not quite as good as it could have been.
 "
Attack of the Demons,55,,critic,"
If South Park, The Evil Dead and Demons had a baby that liked to dabble in the body horror monstrosities of The Thing...it'd look something like Attack of the Demons.
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
In telling these animals' stories, directors Elsa Kremser and Levin Peter decline to anthropomorphize them, instead asking the audience to try out an alien perspective.
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
In the end, I feel as though Space Dogs has a lot to say about... something. I'm just not really sure what it is.
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
By sticking primarily to the dogs' POV, a world that we as humans are familiar with suddenly becomes unfamiliar and nerve-wracking.
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
Many of these bowsers seem to have some German Shepherd in them, and if you're like me, you could watch such critters all day, as matted and mongrel-y as may be...
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
Space Dogs is more meditatively Tarkovskian than History Channel fodder. Kremser and Peter employ plenty of archival and often painful-to-watch footage of these unwitting animal pioneers; they were not ""boldly going,"" but rather ""uncomprehendingly sent.""
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
It relies on immersive photography and small, sharp observations about canine life to keep its audience engaged.
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
A half-baked work with an (admittedly convincing) illusion of lyrical profundity.
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
Our planet is complicated, as are we, as are all lifeforms. Embrace that complexity, both here and beyond our borders.
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
The film draws us through its play toward darker, too-seldom-considered sides of human and doggy nature.
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
The connective tissue between the past and present is superficially about the animals ... On a deeper and unspoken level, though, it's about us...
 "

It's hard to shake the feeling that a genuinely arresting documentary was cast adrift somewhere along the line.

Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
The result isn't pleasant, but it does effectively provoke.

 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
Kremser and Peter connect a roughly hewn space traveling animal history with modern stray subjects, coalescing into a mood piece managing to be mix of effective estrangement and ingenious metaphor.
 "
Space Dogs,81,,critic,"
A fascinating impressionistic documentary by Kresmer and Peter... The alienness of humanity, when seen from another perspective, is evident throughout the film.
 "
My Name Is Pedro,100,,critic,"
As a profile of an inspiring figure, the documentary succeeds on the strength of its subject's personality: colorful, energetic, and empathetic.

My Name Is Pedro,100,,critic,"
Director Lillian LaSalle takes a narrowly focused story and connects it to larger themes that affect everyone. It's an emotional journey that hits uncomfortable truths.

Listless and dull as (frozen) dishwater."
Centigrade,41,25,audience,"First half caught my interest and had some promise however all of that disappeared with the second half and the hideous amount of screaming baby we are made to endure.

Centigrade,41,25,audience,"If Naomi didn't know where she was in the woods, she should've given the phone to Matt when she was able to get through to her dad. I know she's pregnant but she is the most selfish; wouldn't want to be stuck with her."
Centigrade,41,25,audience,"Some really poor decisions on production's part.  Why focus on the dullest part of the story?!? Started slow, uninteresting, and with no depth whatsoever.  Really tawdry and mundane in how it went about, kind of 'experimental theater' feel to it...which is probably not at all how it really happened.  Another ""inspired"" by ""real"" events movie.

Horrific dialogue.

Bad acting.

The woman was an ABSOLUTE B from the very start, hard to believe anyone would stay married to someone like that, not even very believable. Horrific spoiled brat...should have been a horror, stuck in that car with her.

Also...worst survival skills EVER."
Centigrade,41,25,audience,"Dumb and numb,not only due to the weather but because it hopelessly seems to play with the plausible at the point where it kind of looks like sci-fi and not something that could really be happening. Never happens to me a lot but stopped following well before the ending. Left me cold...duh."
Centigrade,41,25,audience,Great concept that falls flat. It could've been easily improved with brief scenes of their backstory and better dialogue. It's okay as a backgrounder at home but I can't imagine how frustrating it would be seeing this in a theater.
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
Centigrade has plenty to offer, both story- and acting-wise. It may strike an extra nerve for anyone watching at home, but that just means it's doing its job well.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
A torturous two hour argument between a husband and wife who can't stand each other
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
Its bitter rawness is terrifying but the connection with the characters makes this a film from which you just can't look away.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
Centigrade was a difficult movie to watch, and while technically well made, it is not very enjoyable.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
More commendable than remarkable. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
Rodriguez and Piazza clearly give their all here, and their performances are a highlight in Centigrade, and I'd definitely recommend it to those who enjoy films centered around characters trying to survive against all odds.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
""The low-budget film is enhanced by its fine technical work, but stalled by its cold story that never quite warms up.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
If only the audience was as trapped as Matt and Naomi, maybe their indecision would count for more.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
Including such raw and fraying emotions in this tale elevates it in ways that are genuinely compelling and heart-wrenching.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
It is a well-informed, realistic take on what it's like to survive being trapped in freezing conditions, and a reminder that this scenario is something many people have had to face.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
This badly written and tediously paced film not only has the characters buried in snow, but the movie also buries itself in substandard nonsense.
 "

Centigrade gives merit to the observation 'thick be the snow that entombs our thin characters.'

Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
A creatively crafted claustrophobic study of a fractured marriage.

Brendan Walsh's Centigrade is crushed by an avalanche of unrealistic plot points and subpar acting.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
[An impressive] debut. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
First-time director/co-writer Brendan Walsh keeps the drama intense enough for the first half of the film, but then the storytelling loses momentum and feels as stuck as [the characters] in their icy grave.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
It can't find, or perhaps has no time to find in 89 minutes, much balance or history in the relationship.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
Within its tight narrative constraints, the immersive film captures the psychological distress of their circumstances. But all the bickering and panic elicits more pity than sympathy, leaving viewers emotionally cold.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
This chilly thriller never turns up the heat, leaving the audience with little reason to chill with the imperiled couple. It's not a disaster or a triumph. It's just...not much of anything.
 "
Centigrade,41,25,critic,"
IFC Midnight's immersion in survivalist tedium.

Project Power,60,47,audience,"As with a lot of Netflix's action films, there's enough in the film to keep it interesting for its runtime. It's not the best film put out by Netflix but it's not really trying to be. One's reaction to the film will go along with those taking the pills. They will either explode with anger or find some enjoyable qualities that do not make it a hard swallow. Both are understandable reactions when it comes to this film. The ideas are there for a good film even though it's not as good as it could have been. It is worth checking out if you're looking for a new and entertaining film with decent acting and action sequences.

Full analysis - https://backseatdirectors.com/2020/08/review-project-power/"
Project Power,60,47,audience,The idea: exciting.  You can take a pill and get and a random superpower.  The delivery: over-complicated attempts at making character ties strong only to jump cut to some decent fight scenes with great visuals.  Then throw in that the pills are part of a drug ring AND some secret evil science - and you just get too much going on without anything going on at all.
Project Power,60,47,audience,"the story was missing somthing but it good over all, amazing cgi."
Project Power,60,47,audience,"Great movie! Entertaining, good story, Jamie Foxx!!! What else do u need."
Project Power,60,47,audience,"A relatively straightforward drugs movie with the twist that the pills provide the users with short term, spectacular looking superpowers.  The plot's nothing special and doesn't fully live up to its premise, but the acting is good and the action scenes are fast paced and stylish.  Most of the film looks good with its urban hip-hop style and attitude and although the villain and her plan is as cliché as they come, the idea of the rich manipulating the poor by using drugs is probably quite close to reality."
Project Power,60,47,audience,An ever age generic film. It wasn't bad
Project Power,60,47,audience,This movie was pretty good it was enjoyable to watch it had a predictable plot but other then that i enjoyed it I would recommend it to people.
Project Power,60,47,audience,I am so glad I finally got to watch this movie. I enjoyed it.
Project Power,60,47,audience,There are some decent performances buried within the mayhem of this mildly ambitious science-fiction saga that's too convoluted to make much of an impact.
Project Power,60,47,audience,"Well paced, funny, socially conscious, and above all a rock solid dynamic between the main cast makes Project Power an enjoyable watch on any occasion."
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
With its scattershot direction, overdone editing and unfocused storytelling, Project Power fails to have the impact it could have.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
This summer is unlike previous summers due to a pandemic were missing over the top big-budget films; however, Netflix has done a great job of filling in the gap and keeping us safe.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
Project Power is a cautionary tale about what can happen if power is unchecked, and perhaps an idealization of some people always being willing and able to do the right thing.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
The premise of a drug that gives you superpowers is absolute dynamite, and although Project Power does have some fun with the idea, it ultimately feels unfocused.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
A blockbuster popcorn maker who manages to keep things happening on the screen throughout the footage. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
Project Power's veins may run thick with pure hokum. But it's hard to object to a film this serious about being silly.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
Overall, Netflix's Project Power is really about how the movie is a fun action entertainer that doesn't need to be more than what it is.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
Project Power is the type of movie you used to reliably find each summer at the theater: an action film that flashes a little comedy, stars someone you want to spend almost two hours with, and has enough happening to keep audiences...
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
Lively enough to hold interest, but this is something of a ragbag overall.
 "

 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
If you're looking for a wild, gritty (and at times predictable) ride them get ready, because ""Project Power"" is poised to entertain.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
The relationship between the three main characters is what sold the film. Then add supernatural powers into the mix, and you're in for a fun adventure. I only wish it ended as strong as it started.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
Project Power executes terribly on what feels like a relatively interesting premise.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
The kind of catastrophic mess that is just too incompetent and earnest to be taken seriously. Instead, through ill-defined alchemy, it becomes unintentionally hilariously entertaining.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
Super high production values make an alluring spectacle of sorts out of a wacky concept...
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
It's fun! It's just not very good.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
Though the script is basically cobbled together from scores of comic books and other movies...has enough well-choreographed action - along with a strong cast - to make it a watchable diversion.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
Disappointingly bland, Project Power will just about pass muster until we can get back into the cinema to see how the big boys do this sort of stuff with much more flair.
 "
Project Power,60,47,critic,"
An ambitious take on what is now a standard science-fiction premise of a drug that grants superpowers to ordinary folk.

Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,audience,"It's pretty good, although slow at times. there were good performances by Pattinson, Rylance, and especially Depp, although he is underused I the film. And also, the cinematography is beautiful."
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,audience,Needs more Pattison action
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,audience,"Beautifully filmed but mind-numbingly slow, this movie becomes as arid as its desert landscape before deflating into a simple moralistic allegory that can be seen coming from a mile away. Johnny Depp does make for a notably creepy villain, however."
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,audience,who are the real barbarians?
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,audience,"The scenery was unbelievable. The acting was good, but sometimes it got preachy. Both leads were too black and white with little gray. It was definitely not boring."
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,audience,Shows how people can be cruel to one another.
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,audience,I gave it one and a half because of cinematography was great in the acting was great but the story was so dry so dull and so boring actually fell asleep for a few minutes really what is Hollywood thinking when they make certain films people want to see something happening yes we want to see story yes we want to see emotion no we don't want to be put to sleep
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,audience,2 out of 5 stars. Waiting for the Barbarians is a film that fails capture any interest with a slow moving direction. Dull characters and story. It has a decent cast. The plot is dull with nothing happening for majority of the movie. It was just difficult trying to sit through it.
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,audience,The cinematography in this movie is beautiful. Moving performance by Mark Rylance. Johnny Depp is excellent as Colonel Joll.
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,audience,"This movie is unique and genius. It's basically a comment on how history is written by the winners. Not the truth. And that so much of warfare is created by man seeing others as ""others"""
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
Ciro Guerra's Waiting for the Barbarians is a remarkable work that outrages one, and ought to outrage one.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
The story that all this luscious style is in service to is really not all that great.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
Rylance gifts Waiting for the Barbarians with an undeniably earnest performance, but it's not quite enough to lift it above derivative mediocrity.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
There's not much here for even the most ardent fan of overdetermined political fables.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
The film is an anti-Rudyard Kipling story that wants to tear down the Empire-loving writer's romanticised notions of non-Western cultures, but does not quite know how.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
It takes me to the limits of apathy when Guerra uselessly repeats the usual themes of his catalog such as oppression, injustice and the barbaric effects of colonialism. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
This film belongs consumingly to Mark Rylance, arguably the world's greatest actor of stage and screen.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
Unflinchingly and sadistically violent, Guerra's film packs all the widescreen beauty of David Lean's epics... but with unbearable sadism at its core, as order breaks inexorably down.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
This all unfolds in glacial style, with Rylance ambling about quietly in amiable confusion.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
Rylance's quietly understated performance is sincere and moving...
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
Without JM Coetzee's prose to round it out, this film of his 1980 novel confronts us too bluntly with the story's didacticism.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
The book, with its themes of paranoia and totalitarianism, was acclaimed as a masterpiece. But the film, which also stars Robert Pattinson and was adapted by Coetzee himself, doesn't quite work.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
Its declarations are too easy, its conclusions too neat.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
Waiting For The Barbarians is a slow burn of a film that gets distracted by the social commentary and the story suffers.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
Rylance is good, Robert Pattinson is wasted and Depp dials-in the same performances he's been giving for years.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
One could almost believe Depp ginned up all his negative publicity to make him more attractive to cast as a villain. Except, you know, Occam's Razor.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
The screenplay is written by J.M. Coetzee, adapting his own 1980 novel with a strikingly free hand but the message left intact - the eternal awful irony of which Them should really fear which Us.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
The movie gives some compelling insight into one man's resistance to racist colonialism and how this struggle wasn't necessarily fought on a battlefield.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
Waiting for the Barbarians is the cinematic equivalent of ketchup -- it may be made of something healthy but the nutrition has been removed, and it's not worth eating without French fries to dip in it.
 "
Waiting for the Barbarians,53,61,critic,"
Adapted from JM Coetzee's acclaimed novel buy the author himself, this darkly involving drama takes a bracing look at imperialism.
 "
"My Father, the Spy",,,critic,"
There is a great movie buried in My Father the Spy, but this is not it.
 "
"My Father, the Spy",,,critic,"
""My Father the Spy"" doesn't have a tidy point to make, but it succeeds at bringing a turbulent reminiscence to life.
 "
Clover,28,55,audience,"The chemistry between all the characters is a sublime connectivity of heart and prowess. The film is ripe with the chuckles of dark comedy, and the cinematography is interesting wiith effective sets and lighting. One of the strengths of the plot is characterization. Too often dark comedies create 1 dimensional cutouts to act as foils to  the protagonist quest. In Clover, each charster is sculpted and real. Fun and dynamic storytelling with flawless casting and masterful direction."
Clover,28,55,audience,"It's not often I can't make it through a movie. But this was terrible, like amateurs writing and filming in one take. Turned it off halfway through."
Clover,28,55,audience,Not any type of cinematic achievement and the child/teen actor wasn’t the best and the story wasn’t the most original but it’s a very easy mob style movie to watch 2.9. . Full of cliches but fun non the less 
Clover,28,55,audience,"Fun Movie !!! ..A Fast Paced Comic Book Ganster Film..Throwback  Feel to it .
Great Indie !!!"
Clover,28,55,audience,"This film had me laughing at times, frightened at times, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout. The greatest praise I can give to any movie is that as soon as it's over I look forward to watching it again- and I certainly felt this way after watching CLOVER."
Clover,28,55,critic,"
The movie's appeal certainly isn't in its poorly written, clunky screenplay that tries to throw in a few curveballs to make it look a lot smarter than it really is.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
Clover is a good idea that never lives up to its potential.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
CLOVER is not as clever as it thinks it is but it benefits from a strong cast...
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
The overly familiar 'Clover' features a solid B-movie cast stuck in a standard B-movie storyline.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
This crime movie's basic framework is wearily familiar, but it gets bonus points for a sense of place, a wry sense of humor, and the clever way it shifts female characters into positions of power.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
So irredeemably awful that it could single-handedly kill anyone's desire to see any more movies under any circumstances for the immediate future.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
While Clover may not be original, it is pretty watchable.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
From the occasional flashy camera angles to a soundtrack peppered with deep-cut R&B songs, this movie slots right into some well-worn grooves. And yet it mostly works, thanks to an ace cast and a story that springs a few surprises.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
Clover is far from revolutionary, copying many of the tropes of past gangster movies without demonstrating the same level of sophistication in the script.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
The main issue ... is that director Jon Abrahams never decides upon the movie's tone.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
It's a good twist, but one that, had it been wedged into a lackadaisical script even 20 pages earlier, could have turned the caper into something even luckier.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
While there are a few laughs to be had in this darkly comic caper, originality is a target that isn't even aimed at, much less hit.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
It's chock-full of gore and expletive-laden banter, but lacks the key ingredients to make it worthy of its influences: original ideas and a strong script.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
Abrahams has the right idea for screen energy, keeping things on the move before the whole endeavor tries to aim for cleverness instead of directness.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
This violent caper lacks any real wit or novelty, ultimately leaning on tired stereotypes rather than doing anything particularly clever with them.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
Precious little of it connects, makes sense or leads anywhere.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
It never manages to overcome its air of overfamiliarity, straining mightily but giving off little but flop sweat.
 "
Clover,28,55,critic,"
Things do get extra silly by the end, but the blackly comedic tone is consistent enough to allow for such a wild turn of events to feel at home nonetheless.

Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself,96,71,critic,"
There's nothing unlikable about the Plimpton we meet here, and his self-deprecation about his experiences feels endearing. It just leaves us wondering whether he also had some ambivalence of his own.

Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,audience,"LIGHT RAIL WRECK

Whoa, has Felicity Huffman ever let herself go!

With a mat of hair and raccoon mascara, Tammy boozes away her welfare check, then concludes her month binge with a wobbly climb to perch atop a precarious bridge, waiting for some form of salvation. Her daughter plays along with the routine, but this ain't no family love in.

Catherine has her own issues, and her crazy mother may or may not be the root cause. Irregardless, they coexist, sparring and pushing buttons as only direct kin can. The dynamic may be old hat, but it is balanced with a good balance of guilt, compassion, fury and a sneaky bite of dark comedy. Tammy's abusive train wreck act is hard to stomach, making Catherine's willingness to play the snappy Saint a bit puzzling. But there they are, stuck in their perfectly orchestrated ruts.

Huffman is particularly enjoyable as a totally despicable character, with just enough glimpses of joy and insight sprinkled amongst her destructive ways to offer some kind of hope. There's a human in there, somewhere.

""Tammy's Always Dying"" is filmed under the omnipresent grey skies of former steel town Hamilton, a rubbly city oh so close to the flashy big time (Toronto) that cleverly mirrors its occupants. Life is hard, and even though there's something on the horizon, it may be unreachable. The second act plays with that rainbow goal dynamic, but muddies the pace, only to have it saved by film's end. The complicated mother - daughter relationship is the heart of the movie, and its ultimate redemption.

Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,audience,"This movie delivers knockout performances and alot of heart. Director Amy Jo Johnson guides her stellar cast in a story that resonates with the joy, heartbreak and complexity of human relationships."

Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,audience,"This story provides a deep insight into the complexities of human relationships. It was memorable - and I still find myself thinking back to various scenes.

Script-y but it has a good lived-in quality to it. The characters are strong. [Felicity] Huffman and [Anastasia] Phillips are fantastic. An interesting and potent comedy-drama.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
In the wake of the college admission scandals Felicity Huffman reminds us once again what a terrific actor she can be, even if the film she is in isn't quite up to those talents.
 "

It's an interesting if not always entirely successful navigation of trauma and its exploitation which suggests Johnson is an interesting storyteller and another confirmation of Huffman's abilities.

Tammy's Always Dying takes a while to find its footing, but once it gets going, it becomes a funny yet emotionally thought-provoking film with two great lead performances.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
The screenplay slips in some lovely, thought-provoking sentiments about adult children with childish parents...
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
Felicity Huffman's tour-de-force performance in Tammy's Always Dying is harrowing, showcasing her versatility as an actor.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
She's a fascinating character in need of a better movie.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
Tammy's Always Dying has a conventional made-for-TV or Netflix feel counterbalancing Huffman's best performance since Transamerica.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
There is a breathtaking level of honest human emotion in Tammy's Always Dying that never seems to bleed over into melodrama.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
Johnson's approach is simply to find sympathy for all of these characters -- as much as they might not want or deserve it.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
Great lead performance in dark, mature suicide dramedy.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
""Tammy's Always Dying"" is a richly observed comedy-drama. Johnson's direction is intelligent and restrained. She trusts her actors, letting us see moments develop among them.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
Some elements work, some don't. It ultimately creates a mixed bag that's just shy of recommendation worthy.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
""Tammy's Always Dying"" gets off to a slow start but by mid film the characters have roped you into their tragic story.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
Strong performances from elevate this heartfelt if predictable made-in-Canada mother/daughter dramedy.
 "
Tammy's Always Dying,76,95,critic,"
Huffman doesn't seem fully invested here - a slur and a tilt seem to be the totality of her acting choices, resulting in a caricature most followers of Canadian indie cinema have seen before.

To Your Last Death,69,79,audience,"Content:
Gritty and well-voiced though more like a game instead of a film
Animation: Elementary, seventies-ish style, not well done
Result: Okay for the 'not-so-demanding'"
To Your Last Death,69,79,audience,"I went into this knowing that the animation wasn't great. I hoped that the storyline would pick up and the preview made it look like a bit of a comedy. But no! Instead I sat through this movies dull plot, which just Happy Death Day with a twist similar to the Saw movies. No comedy, just slow family drama for over an hour. THE ANIMATION WAS F**KING AWFUL! Would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy."
To Your Last Death,69,79,audience,A creative and unique animation movie. Love the humor in this lol
To Your Last Death,69,79,audience,Brutal Anime! Has that Archer vibe on roids lol. On a serious note great film from the voice overs to the animation. Award-winning!
To Your Last Death,69,79,audience,A dope brutal anime. Lots of violence.. just the way I like it
To Your Last Death,69,79,audience,I saw this movie at a festival in San Francisco and it was amazing. Like glued to your chair amazing and you know what it won best animated movie too. I went to their web site and they have a ton of best picture awards so give this movie a chance it is pretty sick and twisted and unlike any thing i have ever seen before. I especially love the main sister Mary she is really believable and the stuff she is put through I mean just nuts. If you like movies like Reanimator and Army of Darknes and John Carpenter and Ash versus Evil Dead then you will def like this crazy over the top movie.
To Your Last Death,69,79,audience,Jason Axinn is seriously on another level. A unique action animation film!!!!
To Your Last Death,69,79,audience,This was epic! Good amount of gore and dark humor - super impressed by this animation movie. A must watch.
To Your Last Death,69,79,audience,"Saw this on the big screen at the Pasadena Film Festival where an audience of 300+ were anticipated to attend, but because of the Corona virus, 30 people showed. No matter, we 30 die-hards (pun intended) guffawed and hooted enough to fill the theater. What we saw was a nifty 100% hand-drawn animated full-feature horror film that looked amazing with name recognition cast including Shatner and Baccarin made on an indie micro budget. Let that last part sink in because it is an achievement in and of itself. The film hits the mark for its intended audience of people who love horror film tropes and are fans of Archer-style animation. Especially notable is the score and sound -- so crucial to a horror flick -- punches well above weight. TYLD should easily find its way onto Adult Swim."
To Your Last Death,69,79,audience,So fun! Grisly and comic. 
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
Watching this movie is an absolute blast.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
To Your Last Death is engaging as a genre story. The animation is not spectacular, but the combination of all of its factors make it an oddity worth watching.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
Makes the best of its low-budget animation to deliver some gruesome thrills sure to excite horror genre enthusiasts.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
With campy narration from William Shatner, no less, this bloody 'toon clearly doesn't take itself too seriously. But it's also overlong, with too little wit or point to sustain the attention of anyone except diehard gamer fanboys...
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
""To Your Last Death"" looks and feels like it was made by an angry, horny 12-year-old raised on junk food, bad 1990s horror movies and death metal.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
This is a bold and unusual film that, even if it isn't quite as accomplished as it ought to be, marks the arrival of an innovative and exciting director.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
Ultimately, To Your Last Death is a diverting film that doesn't quite succeed... And as a result, it never manages to do justice to any of those elements. This prevents the movie from being truly satisfying.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
Extremely violent, graphic animated horror.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
To Your Last Death is arguably more brutal than it is intricate, but it moves well, provides some jolts, and contains a surprising amount of heart.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
The screenplay never quite manages to establish the Gamemaster and her cadre of bettors or the various degrees of control that they have over the proceedings, leading to an increasingly frustrating litany of narrative rug-pulls.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
A gory gimmick without a decent movie behind it.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
A devilishly clever concept that almost manages to reach the finish line before somewhat losing its way.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
Whilst the film has it's share of blood, gore and SAW-style 'games' this is not excessive and the film it more driven by it's plot and characters than the action sequences; the plot even offers a few classic twists and turns that will keep you guessing.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
Despite its obvious flaws, To Your Last Death, is one of the best action/horror films I've seen in a long time.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
Jason Axinn's hyperviolent anime offers an alien-eye view on our capacity for self-destruction at a familial and corporate level.
 "
To Your Last Death,69,79,critic,"
A stunningly executed animation that, whilst let down a little by an overly familiar plot, still offers plenty to enjoy.

Cousins,,,audience,"A beautiful film even is American audiences will find two cousins in love a bit strange. The two young men were exceptional, as was the girl chasing one. Loved it completely and thought it was genuinely romantic."
Cousins,,,audience,"Gostoso de assistir, divertido, leve e com uma linda história!!! Filme mais que recomendado!! Se vc quer um filme pra assistir e ficar com uma sensação boa, essa é uma boa pedida!!! Thiago Cazado e Paulo Sousa demonstraram sintonia em cena e o resto do elenco deu conta do recado!!! Recomendadíssimo!!!"
Cousins,,,audience,"This new film is one that will allow you to feel emotions, make you laugh ... and has an ending that I did not anticipate (but was much liked).  Well written, well acted and good cinematography.  It was my favorite at the Annual International LGBT Film Festival in Winston-Salem, NC (OUT at the Movies) in October 2019."
Cousins,,,audience,sweet home alabama :)      worm WORM
Cousins,,,audience,Finally a gay movie with happy ending! I've watched all of Thiago Cazado's movies and each one gets better and better. Cousins is a feel good movie from the start. Keep them coming and honing your craft!
Cousins,,,critic,"
Peppered with some really charming or romantically charged scenes that are dragged down by its more poorly executed moments and a less than competent translation, I'd suggest waiting for the remake.
 "
Cousins,,,critic,"
At its core, the film is a remarkably sweet love story.
 "
Cousins,,,critic,"
A cheery little comedy which wears its heart on its sleeve, Cousins interweaves a sweet tale of first love with a comedy of manners which, in its turn, pokes fun at the hypocrisy of some uptight Christians.
 "
Cousins,,,critic,"
Not much that's novel, cute, funny or romantic in this gay teens take a tumble Brazilian rom-com. Titillation? Sure.

Chameleon,100,79,audience,"Almost kind of good, but not really. Though the film was reasonably entertaining, it ended with no ending. It just sat there."
Chameleon,100,79,audience,Quality indie film. Great acting and production. The storyline for sure is a winner and it was only right it was shot in LA.
Chameleon,100,79,audience,Good actors and plot but it could have been better. It could have been polished a little more in terms of editing and sound and it would have been way better. Still a good indie movie though but certain parts feels rushed
Chameleon,100,79,audience,Were we all watching the same movie? That was a real stinker.
Chameleon,100,79,audience,"The podcast brought me here and I think this deserves way more awards that it already has. Clever plot, just the right amount of dialogue to create suspense and the twists had me in tune through the whole film. I have to say like many people on here the film did start of a little slow, perhaps the editing could have been better but if you appreciate films (especially indie films) this is one you need to rent."
Chameleon,100,79,audience,A good crime film. Marcus Mizelle you are one talented director and I'm looking forward to more films from you.
Chameleon,100,79,audience,Low budget. No story. Some episodes of dateline are better
Chameleon,100,79,audience,"The story line is solid as was the actors and quality of the production. It did start of a little slow but once the characters started developing it got really interesting and the plot thickened. This is one of those indie films you can watch and wonder how on earth they made this with little to no budget - they definitely out did a lot of big budget films I've seen this year. To sum up I agree with the critics on here, Chameleon is a great indie film."
Chameleon,100,79,audience,Great Movie! The ending was setup perfect for a sequel.
Chameleon,100,79,audience,We just seen it on Prime thanks to a YouTube recommended film trailer and it had us glued to the screen right to the very end. The film is basically about what really goes on in the hills of LA haha. No but really its a solid thriller film. I didn't expect the end to end the way it did so it's not predictable and will have you guessing what might happen next.
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
Chameleon's non-linear narrative and slow-paced rythm turns a small crime story into a though-provoking piece that earns some unexpected and well deserved rewatchability value.
 "
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
""Chameleon"" won't change your life, but it is a competent glance at the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles' glitz and glamour.
 "
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
Marcus Mizelle's independent crime drama is a masterpiece of concision that eventually cuts a little too close to the bone.
 "
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
""Chameleon"" aptly deals with the nuanced consequences of a successful crime.
 "
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
Chameleon is good-looking and charming and fun
 "
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
A multi-million dollar film can be a dud, while a low-budget project -- such as Chameleon -- can be impressive.
 "
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
Writer/director and cinematographer Mizelle shows technical aptitude that significantly elevates this tale of morally bankrupt crooks preying on the dysfunctional relations of the wealthy.
 "
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
From neo-noir shadows to burnished vistas, the movie is consistently captivating in its ocular offerings.
 "
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
Chameleon is a taut thriller that rewards an observant viewer.
 "
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
Chameleon is a promising early effort by a talented young director and a difficult plodding script from a not so talented writer. It's just too bad they are the same person.
 "
Chameleon,100,79,critic,"
It's a character-driven crime film that looks surprisingly polished for a movie with a total budget that was was less than I paid for my last used car.

Bathroom Stalls & Parking Lots,,80,audience,So fresh! Absolute Must See! Very funny and very real too. Can't wait to see the next one!
Bathroom Stalls & Parking Lots,,80,audience,I loved it. Would recommend watching!!!
Bathroom Stalls & Parking Lots,,80,critic,"
Bathroom Stalls & Parking Lots is able to effectively explore a range of issues that many young gay and bisexual men are faced with in this technology driven time and does so with a careful gaze which never exploits its subject matter.
 "
Bathroom Stalls & Parking Lots,,80,critic,"
We desperately need a film to explore that world and make a serious comment on it. Bathroom Stalls & Parking Lots just isn't that film.

Corporate Animals,25,16,audience,Extremely boring. Missed opportunity. No direction
Corporate Animals,25,16,audience,One word - Trash......
Corporate Animals,25,16,audience,"I've seen worse movies, but not many."
Corporate Animals,25,16,audience,I'd never heard of this movie until the Crackle commercial and I'm glad i watched. It's great.
Corporate Animals,25,16,audience,This is trash. Easily the worst comedy movie of 2019.
Corporate Animals,25,16,audience,Lots of surprises in this movie. Frightening !
Corporate Animals,25,16,audience,It really sucks that such a cool idea got so poorly executed. Corporate Animals could've been a great comedy but it settles for mediocre humor and a cheap shot at being actually funny. It's not a movie I'd recommend but it wasn't bad enough to the point where I couldn't keep watching.
Corporate Animals,25,16,audience,One of the worst movies of the year...nothing else really needs to be said
Corporate Animals,25,16,audience,Pretty funny - great cast :)
Corporate Animals,25,16,audience,"Abysmal in every way. Supposed to be a black comedy but , to me, it was just terribly unfunny and even turned my stomach. Couldn't wait till it was over, only watched it to the end to write a review. I'm a Demi Moore fan and really sorry she took this role, and Ed Helms is only in the first 15-20 minutes of the film. I would say avoid at all costs."
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Director Patrick Brice's film presents itself as a comedy and you might be of the mindset that there should be enough talent there to raise a few laughs. It doesn't.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
If you're going to do deadpan humor, don't explain every joke. If you're going to do an ensemble piece, maybe don't have twice as many people as you need.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Overall, Corporate Animals suffers from an imbalance of predictability and creativity. It has some hilarious moments but ultimately, it feels like a missed opportunity.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Despite some clever one-liners, the idea hits the rocks once the characters are trapped and the screenplay gives them nowhere to go.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Tries to coast on grisly slapstick and the kind of social ""satire"" that constitutes little more than gawking at squabbling jerks.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
It is a fantastic idea that never gels into anything worth watching, and I suggest you miss it.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Many of the jokes lead to nothing more than just brainless goofiness for its own sake. Some comedies are fine as pure slapstick, but the gags are so obvious, so on the nose or just thrown around with little gusto that it's rather stale.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Corporate Animals is an absolute chore to sit through. The film's attempt to satirize corporate culture is painfully unfunny.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
In the end, that's the story of Corporate Animals - a lack of commitment. It wants to be a dark scathing look at our economic climate with jokes, but it blinks. Instead, it settles for bland, warmed-over commentary that barely elicits a chuckle.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Demi Moore deserves credit for going all in on a bold role like this. Unfortunately, while her performance has bite, the film itself doesn't really.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Inconsequential and tiresome,. it's a sub-standard, if subversive satire....
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
This mostly laugh-free dark comedy plunges into icky territory, with largely unlikable characters; aside from trying to mock the American workforce, it doesn't seem to have much of a point.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
A ludicrous and disgusting black comedy.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Corporate culture gets a delightfully twisted kick in the *ss when a 'team-building retreat' turns disastrous. As horror vies with comedy, the pitch(black)-perfect cast gets the balance just right.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Screenwriter Sam Bain's random gags feel like a desperate attempt to be shocking.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
The film is written so broadly and doesn't have many, if any, spurts of energy to sustain its short runtime.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
A miserable time in poor company.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Mercifully short but still stretched far beyond sustainability, Corporate Animals is a methodically tedious comedy.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
Sophomoric, asinine, and painfully unfunny. You would have to be a dumb and shallow masochist to enjoy it.
 "
Corporate Animals,25,16,critic,"
[P]oor Demi Moore - playing the self-centered CEO of a failing company - comes off as stiff and shrill, setting the tone for a movie that's stilted from start to finish.
 "
Night,,,critic,"
Focusing on the exploitive excess, instead of the exploration of darker themes, Night is little more than amateur torture...
 "
Underneath,,,audience,Blake Harris is outstanding in this thought-provoking thriller. Very enjoyable indeed.
Underneath,,,critic,"
It is a glimpse into a new talent who I hope we see more from in the future.
 "
Afghan Cycles,100,,critic,"
On the surface all Afghan Cycles is talking about is riding a bicycle. On a deeper level, it is talking about individual freedom and autonomy.
 "
Afghan Cycles,100,,critic,"
Afghan women cyclists train despite death threats.
 "
Afghan Cycles,100,,critic,"
Revelatory, but not nearly as upbeat and uplifting as the filmmaker hoped it would be.
 "
Afghan Cycles,100,,critic,"
It's a film which captures the current refugee crisis and all of the horrors that entails, whilst humanising those caught up in it.
 "
Afghan Cycles,100,,critic,"
t's perhaps a little longer than it needs to be, but I can understanding [director Sarah] Menzies and her team wanting to show us as much of these women's stories as possible.
 "
Afghan Cycles,100,,critic,"
What we get is a much more complex, multi-layered portrait of Afghanistan than has been see in the West for many a year.
 "
Gonzalo Fonseca: Membra Disjecta & A Life in Stone,,,critic,"
While we get an astonishing amount of access into his life and work, the major problem with Gonzalo Fonseca: Membra Disjecta & A Life in Stone is its reverence...its a pretty documentary and vaguely interesting so I can recommend it.
 "
Manson: Music From an Unsound Mind,,,critic,"
Takes a deep dive into Manson's tenure as a singer songwriter, and how it was the key to infiltrate a world of the rich and famous.
 "
Manson: Music From an Unsound Mind,,,critic,"
Through talking head interviews with biographers, former Manson family members and associates, and a fat stack of stunning archival footage and photos to punch up the narration, director Tom O'Dell fashions an all-encompassing tour de force.
 "
Manson: Music From an Unsound Mind,,,critic,"
I will say it is worth watching, but you might want to keep a finger ready on the fast forward button.
 "
Wicked Witches,0,,critic,"
It's a bad sign when you fall asleep during a horror movie, right?
 "
Wicked Witches,0,,critic,"
It just doesn't cast a very memorable spell, the whole thing lacking in the type of magic that might have gotten under my skin and made this one worthwhile.
 "
Wicked Witches,0,,critic,"
Writer-director Martin Pickering and his co-writer and brother Mark don't try to do too much with their debut feature,
 "
Wicked Witches,0,,critic,"
A lulu of a finale doesn't quite save this one, but is something to see.
 "
Wicked Witches,0,,critic,"
There isn't much dialog, the plot isn't terribly complicated, and the directors leave most coherence off the screen entirely. But it's enjoyably cheap and nasty.
 "
3 Lives,,,audience,"I really enjoyed 3 Lives. It's a slow moving, feminist psychological thriller about trauma, retribution and violence. Not an easy watch, but rewarding. 
I saw 3 Lives got awful ratings and reviews on IMDB and I can see how it isn't for everyone. However if you don't get distracted by that or the sensational axe murderer poster (There's NO axe murderer in the entire movie and it's NOT your run of the mill action flick!), you'll find 3 Lives to be a bold, high-quality independent movie with a message, that will make you think. It's worth giving it a try."
3 Lives,,,critic,"
[It] certainly keeps the audience guessing as to what is happening and loyalties shift from one person to another. This is a film where you can't take your eyes off the screen because you might miss something.
 "
3 Lives,,,critic,"
... 3 Lives is confrontational, forward-thinking, and not without a few surprises.
 "
3 Lives,,,critic,"
3 Lives is an uninspired mess of a film that fails in every aspect.
 "
Second Star on the Right,83,,critic,"
Ruth Caudeli's Second Star on the Right is a finely-acted, exquisitely crafted exploring adulthood, friendship and femininity with contrasting styles.
 "
Second Star on the Right,83,,critic,"
Tension between the friends raises to a breaking point during Angelica's bachelorette party. Alcohol and constant teasing from her friends lead to Emilia going too far.
 "
Second Star on the Right,83,,critic,"
Heartbreaking and uplifting. Second Star on the Right is an intimate slice-of-life drama with elements of magical realism.
 "
Second Star on the Right,83,,critic,"
Caudeli's choice of formats does more to emphasize the shortcomings of the narrative than convey any type of bold stylistic statement.
 "
Second Star on the Right,83,,critic,"
Second Star on the Right winningly captures our varying levels of maturation and individualism, with beauty and style.
 "
Second Star on the Right,83,,critic,"
This is only [Ruth] Caudeli's second feature but she's clearly a talent worth watching.
 "
The Dark Within,,,audience,what a stupid movie!
The Dark Within,,,audience,"The story mixes mysticism and science together for a supernatural horror show. There is a more than subtle nod to 80's cult horror, most notably 'Evil Dead'. Keith does offer a bit more creativity and originality in his approach. ""The Dark Within"", compared to other more recent retro horror homages, is slightly more experimental. Blending both the psuedo science of psychic ability manipulation and the more sinister exploration of the demonic essence, the film does establish a clear, interesting storyline.

All that being said, ""The Dark Within"" does have some flaws. For one thing the platform of experimenting with psychic abilities isn't developed strong enough to sell the plot point, and the whole struggle to reconcile ones past while battling internal demons drags out a little too long. In the film's defense despite the sluggish start, ""The Dark Within"" does finally get there about 45 minutes into it.

The horror elements are straight up, cool atmospheric tricks. The shock moments work, the CGI elements are quality displays that sell the whole demonic haunting aspects, and the creature design is awesome and creepy. The cinematography talents and shadowing really frame ""The Dark Within"" in a traditional 80's VHS horror style. And it all really kicks in around that 45 minute mark. I did find the choices for ending the film a bit cheap, but it creates an easy way of questioning the truth of the events we just saw."
The Dark Within,,,critic,"
The Dark Within is a movie that asks the viewer, what is real? By the end of the film, however, I just did not care. As a film, it just can't seem to decide what it wants to be and lacks a sense of self.
 "
A Bright Light: Karen and the Process,,,critic,"
A Bright Light is a beautiful love note to a forgotten artist, a tragic story of wasted potential, and an exploration into the primal urge to create.
 "
A Bright Light: Karen and the Process,,,critic,"
A bit less time spent on arts and crafts and a lot more focus on Dalton's mesmerizing music and tragic life trajectory might have saved this sporadically diverting but frustratingly narcissistic exercise.
 "
FP2: Beats of Rage,67,100,audience,"Joseph Campbell once wrote that ""a hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself."" Jason Trost, without a doubt, has entrusted his soul to this franchise. I've been a die hard fan since the first film and can say without a doubt that this is what he was meant to do. To guide us past the bs of nowhere, through the wrong side of the tracks, towards the paradise we know as THE FP. Prepare to get 187'd. And remember - it's a 3 drink minimum!"

FP2: Beats of Rage,67,100,audience,Immerse yourself in the FP universe and you will not be disappointed. Think of it as an epsom salt bath for the soul.
FP2: Beats of Rage,67,100,audience,This is the sequel you have been waiting for simple yet refreshing
FP2: Beats of Rage,67,100,critic,"
Weird and silly and often feels made up entirely of in-jokes, ""Beats of Rage"" is also wild and fun and played straight-the on-the-surface seriousness makes the absurdity that much more ridiculous.
 "
FP2: Beats of Rage,67,100,critic,"
Mr. Trost's major strength is that he has found a way to make purposefully ""bad"" movies for comic effect.
 "
FP2: Beats of Rage,67,100,critic,"
Because FP2 is all stupid surface, held together by Trost's surly charm. It may be filled with dumb ""beat off"" puns, but it's just smart enough to be all heart.
 "
FP2: Beats of Rage,67,100,critic,"
Fans of the first film will definitely have a blast seeing their favorite characters again. Get you some booze, a bunch of your friends, and head on down to Frazier Park!
 "
FP2: Beats of Rage,67,100,critic,"
Great for the existing fans, but I don't see this one necessarily making the impression that the original did.
 "
FP2: Beats of Rage,67,100,critic,"
It's just down to whether you dig that style or not. If you do, you'll get exactly what you expect. If you don't, you'll be so annoyed you'll wish you'd been 187ed.
 "
The Dirty Kind,,,critic,"
In this age of ironic and meta-entertainment, you might find yourself tempted to believe that this is some kind of performance art. Some kind of Andy Kaufmanesque joke played by a wily comic genius. Unfortunately, I don't think that is the case.
 "
The Dirty Kind,,,critic,"
An early candidate for the worst movie of 2019.
 "
Renegade Dreamers,,,audience,Testing testing testing
Renegade Dreamers,,,audience,"This documentary prominently features a known sexual predator (Jeremy ""germ"" DeHart) who assaulted and abused at least six women and non-binary people from the time this movie was filmed to the time it was released. He is featured as some sort of renegade hero despite this. His victims were equally, if not more, fascinating and talented artists, yet they were conveniently left out of the film. How and why he wasn't left out of the final cut is beyond me. These accusations existed at the time of filming and DeHart continued to commit sexual crimes, as well as physical and emotional abuse, clear up until it was released. He's probably still committing them to this day, as activists and homeless people tend to have a distrust of the police and not report. Fuck this movie. Fuck giving him a platform."
Renegade Dreamers,,,critic,"
Renegade Dreamers is a documentary that doesn't ask it's viewers to do anything beyond ask themselves, ""When did you stop caring?""
 "
Renegade Dreamers,,,critic,"
Timely, enlightening and inspirational. Equally entertaining and provocative.
 "
Renegade Dreamers,,,critic,"
A kaleidoscope of vibrant generational influences on protest music and spoken word poetry across the decades. Connecting the '30s, the Beats and '60s culture with the contrasting political and creative struggles younger artists face today.
 "
Game Girls,,,audience,Too Real...and Funny at times!!!
Game Girls,,,critic,"
There is a lot that Game Girls forces the viewer to grapple with... but the danger of focusing on and fetishizing a single story is that the audience is encouraged to extrapolate that this is the experience for everyone in Skid Row.
 "
Game Girls,,,critic,"
It's a one-day-at-a-time kind of portrait that's dispiriting, unsettling and undeniably authentic.
 "
Game Girls,,,critic,"
The unfiltered, and at times unsettling film forces us to acknowledge that the crisis of homelessness is not just faceless statistics.
 "
Game Girls,,,critic,"
Game Girls doesn't really go beyond its fly-on-the-wall approach to its heroines, offering us lots of intimacy but nothing that really sets its story within a greater social or political context.

Over the Moon,81,74,audience,"That was a lot of singing. Even though it does have some charming and cute moments, and metaphorically serves as an example of letting go from the past, it felt like they took a bunch of elements we've already seen in other animated movies before, making it too predictable, aiming for a younger target. Wasn't invested in the characters either. The musical numbers are half cool, halfway too corny. The animation is great! Maybe it's the biggest asset of this colorful trip over the moon."
Over the Moon,81,74,audience,"É um filme legal, que sempre consegue manter o mesmo nível, de diversão, de uma inventividade de criaturas e cenários louváveis, de piadinhas, etc. E não falha muito e por isso que é bom, mas não é um filme que vai marcar sua vida."
Over the Moon,81,74,audience,"Strong Beginning and that's it...
The animation starts really well. The animation, although not as impressive as Disney or Pixar, was still really beautiful. The setting for the story really draws you in. The characters are likable. Up until the point of FeiFei's journey to the moon. The setting is just awful to look at. The whole popstar Chang'e thing was just awful. Why was it there? I don't know, but it was completely unnecessary and jarring. Speaking of the songs in this movie - they are just not memorable. Again it just reminds you how much better Disney is at creating musical pieces which grip you and stay with you. Perhaps it would have been better to just leave out the singing. Especially the pop numbers. From that moment on the characters become kind of bland and lose me. Their motivations are questionable. The pacing is all over the place. I just couldn't wait fir the whole thing to end. It could have been a great movie but it's like they run out o steam mid writing and animating and it just turned into awfulness. I'd rate it between 1-2. Gave it 1 star  for the strong introduction to the story."
Over the Moon,81,74,audience,"TMI, and also scary at times!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Over the Moon,81,74,audience,"There are times when the story beats feel a bit too familiar so it's not all that unique. That being said, this has a lot of heart and emotional moments, is beautifully animated, and features some really good music. Phillipa Soo is someone I could listen to for hours."
Over the Moon,81,74,audience,"In understanding the context of how this film came to be and what it was intended for there is no questioning the ""why"" of its existence, but I might humbly suggest that if you found Over the Moon to be particularly moving that you seek out Jill Culton's underseen Abominable from last year. The two animated films are surprisingly similar with Culton's film succeeding more in the realm of utilizing the folklore and mythical elements of its story to lend real soul to the proceedings. The animation in Glen Keane and John Kahrs film is undeniably breathtaking with the visuals that accompany Fei Fei's trip to the moon certainly matching her expectations as well as ours, but while the film seems to desire a more substantial weight it feels executed more in the vein of a kitschy fantastical tale solely for the kiddos. One won't be mad if they end up spending 90 minutes on this adventure, but I feel the obligation to suggest the comparable Abominable for, even as Over the Moon will sit well, the one with the yeti gets the same job done in a more impactful fashion."
Over the Moon,81,74,audience,"4 star animation and production design, 3 star story. Man oh man, are those songs classic musical songs. It really impresses upon me how conventionalized the genre is. I am 150% here for ethnically specific children's entertainment, especially of the sure-it's-fine kind: that's the real test of a more equitable society, so while I don't think this is great, I DO think that's a big step forward for US media, and I do kinda want to live in this fairy tale Chinese village--if only there were a place like that in China actually...."
Over the Moon,81,74,audience,Cute story. Adorable Bungee. Shes cute. Short and sweet.
Over the Moon,81,74,audience,"TheReelness.com: With astounding animation, great songs and a poignant story about loss, grief and joy, if you see one animated movie this year make it this one."
Over the Moon,81,74,audience,"A nice movie, but at times the music seems a bit out of place."

Over the Moon is a beautiful movie that celebrates Chinese culture, tells a story of overcoming grief and has some great animation and while the main story beats feel familiar, the high gloss visuals are unpredictable and consistently interesting.

Offers the novelty of Fei Fei warbling about the wonders of engineering and physics as she plans her home-made space ship, bunny shaped to honor the rabbit in the moon. It's even catchy.
 "
Over the Moon,81,74,critic,"
When you pair Jeong and Chiu's wonderful comic relief with Ang and Soo's heavier emotional conflicts, you can't help but enjoy the effective way cast complements animation.
 "
Over the Moon,81,74,critic,"
The latest animated musical has endearing characters, eye-popping colors and action galore. ""Over the Moon"" is about loss, legends, and growing up, with something for every age group.
 "
Over the Moon,81,74,critic,"
The unfussy script, by the late Audrey Wells, and a roster of charming songs channel the emotions of Fei Fei's journey - from beloved daughter to rebel teen and beyond - that Keane's visual team depicts so radiantly.
 "
Over the Moon,81,74,critic,"
The animation is both creative and eye-popping colorful. We travel on a space adventure filled with touching family moments and has a soundtrack of catchy, memorable songs along with an adorable bunny and sweet little frog.

The first ""Disney-a-like"" in decades that's good enough to eclipse some of the genuine articles!
 "
Over the Moon,81,74,critic,"
Over The Moon is very much about dealing with loss in life, in a way that's never preachy, by drawing subtle parallels.

Over the Moon,81,74,critic,"
The film becomes a visual extravaganza once Fei Fei lands on the lunar landscape. The world-building is truly amazing.
 "

Some reviewers have criticized the film for being too Disney-esque. I'm not sure why that's a bad thing--but I'll grant you that the movie feels comfortably familiar.

On the plus side, Over The Moon's level of craft when it comes to the animation, visuals and production is, to borrow a term from Chang'e's lexicon, ""spectacularia"".

Dolittle,14,76,audience,Just another cute wholesome movie the critics hate cause it doesn't brainwash your youth with the appoperite ideology.
Dolittle,14,76,audience,I loved it!  It had a wonderful funny cast and a warm-hearted storyline.  Thank you Mr. Downey Jr. for a dang good family movie!!
Dolittle,14,76,audience,Great kids movie. My kids had fun and laughed.
Dolittle,14,76,audience,A definite waste of time and money do NOT watch this
Dolittle,14,76,audience,"this is sssssoooooooooooooooooooooooo great, acually"
Dolittle,14,76,audience,"I enjoyed it throughly 😊! I love movies that delve in the unusual and open up your imagination to things you've not...well imagined. Though I'm not familiar with the book series, the movie is a much more enjoyable take on the characters and storyline than its predecessor. It gives me similar feelings to when I watched Robin William's ‘Hook' (which I believe is really underrated) - familiar yet different, you kinda know how it will end yet you are still taken by the journey. My family had all smiles on their faces at the end - to me that is a sign of a good movie 🍿"
Dolittle,14,76,audience,"First of all, I started watching this with some kind of prejudice. Never liked previous Dolittle movies because they always did little for my entertainment. And then there's RDJ. Don't get me wrong, I loved his performance in the MCU. I loved seeing him as Sherlok Holmes. 
But then again, Tony and Sherlok appeared to be too similar for my taste. Same mannerism, the snarky snark, the arrogance and both on a genius level, regarding the genre he played it.
He caught me off guard in Dolittle. I've been expecting a Tony Stark persona, talking to animals. And I was disappointed, in a good way. RDJ actually is a great actor, able to completely change the way people can perceive him. No Tony, no Sherlok and that accent... And I enjoyed the way they've changed the way he talks to animals.

Still not a big fan of Dolittle, but I think it's worth to give this movie a shot."
Dolittle,14,76,audience,"my 8 year old son is completely in love with the character Dolittle and his friends, finally a children's film, clean, exciting as their world should be, a beautiful fairy tale."
Dolittle,14,76,audience,A cast full of stars who did their utmost to make the worst performances of their lives mixed with a rough script and bad taste jokes.
Dolittle,14,76,audience,Everybody's nuts. This movie was great! We got sucked into the tragic love story from the very start and the animal performances had us laughing out loud. We watched it straight through without getting off the couch. Ignore the snobby reviews and give it a chance.
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
Dolittle suffers, a bit, from having so many characters, so many moving parts.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
Dolittle barely pays attention to its story, and its three villains scream their characters' bad intentions well before they are actually revealed.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
Downey brings a sense of bemused confusion, topped with a mealy-mouthed Billy Connolly impression that changes from scene to scene. It's a pantomime performance that makes the best of his finely tuned comic timing but feels sloppy and needlessly mannered.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
The story is silly and hyperbolic. The performances are manic, at times ... But Dolittle is sure to charm a new generation of kids willing to take a journey into a magical world of talking animals and their one-of-a-kind hero.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
The story is barely comprehensible, clearly patched together after extensive reshoots, and the final result is a bloated, expensive mess.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
The film lacks energy and proves to be nothing more than a collection of questionable narrative and acting choice that results in a movie that's a laughable bore
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
Dolittle isn't even good-bad. It's just bad-bad.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
Much of Dolittle is dull and makes little narrative sense and judging by the reactions of the kids in my theatre, at times a tad too dark and kind of boring.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
There are problems all over the shop here, with almost every story turn truncated and rushed as if the narrative has been repeatedly chopped, reshaped and tangled.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
A spectacularly ugly exercise in focus-groupthink that tries to please everyone, and thus inevitably pleases no one.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
His beloved Tony Stark sarcasm is nowhere to be found, nor is it replaced by a Robin Williams zaniness or a Gene Wilder twinkle in the eye. Instead, he collects a paycheck like a disinterested Johnny Depp, mumbling in a weird accent that's hard to hear.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
Dolittle isn't a terrible film. It's just a terribly generic film in an era when we've been bombarded with kids-oriented movies that have talking animals.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
How does one find inspiration to review a movie that lacks ambition to be anything more than just ""okay?""
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
Often hard to understand and easy to laugh at, Downey Jr.'s Dolittle interpretation doesn't just fail to lift up a poor film; he helps it sink instead.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
What should have been a magical and epic adventure ends up shipwrecked by a rushed script and flat comedy with an over-reliance on fart jokes and anachronistic dialogue.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
Dolittle announces itself as an adventure comedy, yet the adventure is nascent and the comedy is tedious.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
Dolittle is slow, predictable, and RDJ is extremely hard to understand. But kids will love the potty humor and talking animals, so there is that.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
Other than the promising storybook-like animated prologue narrated by Emma Thompson, who voiced Polynesia the parrot, the rest of the movie quickly nosedives and barely recovers.
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
I wouldn't recommend it
 "
Dolittle,14,76,critic,"
It wasn't good...but at least it wasn't boring!

Queen & Slim,83,92,audience,This movie was uninteresting to me. It seemed so slow and the storyline was meh. 
Queen & Slim,83,92,audience,A great movie on so many different levels. Very thoughtful and relevant. Reminded me of Thelma and Louise.
Queen & Slim,83,92,audience,"Queen & Slim is a road trip movie with a difference. There is a lot to take in, being hard to watch but impossible to look away. Kaluuya and Turner-Smith are sublime, having big futures ahead. Powerful in many ways."
Queen & Slim,83,92,audience,"Queen And Slim has two powerful lead performances, a tragic love story and a strong message at it’s center even if it feels a little forced, it’s still worth the watch. "
Queen & Slim,83,92,audience,"First the good, the cinematography was great other than that the movie was trash, the storyline didn't make sense, the supporting characters were interesting however I just could not recommend this movie."
Queen & Slim,83,92,audience,"Great acting, okay story."
Queen & Slim,83,92,audience,"fantastic movie, great depiction of racial realities in the us weaved into a riveting story. very well made"
Queen & Slim,83,92,audience,Powerful movie. Great script and acting.
Queen & Slim,83,92,audience,"Intense, cool, and sad all the same time."
Queen & Slim,83,92,audience,"Where do I even begin. How about the beginning? The movie set a disingenuous tone for me at the beginning. To suggest that the scenario that developed leading to the officers death is typical in our society is both insulting and heavy handed.  A more subtle buildup to the officers death would have been less laughable than some rogue murderous copy blasting away at two non threatening people.  The segment of the black community that believed that to be typical and ate that up should be ashamed of themselves and so should the media who distorts these types of things. I'm sure the director got just what she wanted, a fist pump from the black and liberal community. It would be more warranted if this movie and any roots in reality whatsoever."
Queen & Slim,83,92,critic,"
I think this would have been a much more effective piece of social commentary if it just focused on these two and their struggles. When it does focus on these two, it's this really cracking on-the-run thriller.
 "
Queen & Slim,83,92,critic,"
With terrific performances Queen & Slim transcends the outlaws-on-the-lam genre. Instead it is a timely humanistic drama that combines resilience with despair.
 "

It's an uneven, if watchable, lovers-on-the-lam film.

 "
Queen & Slim,83,92,critic,"
Although the film's aspirations exceed its grasp by being about romance, social issues, action, and drama, Queen & Slim still enthralls and compels in ways that transcend its genre tropes.

Lena Waithe (""Master of None"") sends Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie-Turner Smith on the lam after killing a police officer in self-defense during a racially charged traffic stop.

There's a lot to like about Queen & Slim and it's important to see African American women (both writers and directors) getting the chance to create stories for the world to engage with.

A daring reflection of the 21st century state of race and culture in America.

 "
Queen & Slim,83,92,critic,"
Seething, kaleidoscopic fury that surfaces as a dense, dreamlike variation on the classic outlaw-couple romance after a diner first date between a pair of middle-class African Americans.. There's bravura and bravado, style and anger to burn.
 "
Queen & Slim,83,92,critic,"
Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are a perfect pairing in a ""True Romance""-style scurry across the Southern States.

Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,audience,Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is a near-perfect movie that introduces us to a rag-tag team of heroes that are extremely funny and lovable paired with an amazing soundtrack. It's too bad that the villain was so generic and bland that stops this movie from reaching perfection.
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,audience,One dysfunctional family I love to watch
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,audience,"An absolutely fantastic mix of action, comedy, and great storytelling. The chemistry between the characters made this movie even more enjoyable than I could imagine. I would definitely recommend Guardians of the Galaxy to anyone, Marvel fan or not."
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,audience,Undoubtedly one of the best Marvel films and the best comedy film of all time
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,audience,The movie has grown on me over time but is more of a movie to pass the time than an actual movie that is a must watch. Chris Pratt does a great job as Star Lord but Rocket and Groot steal the show
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,audience,Another hit for Marvel! Groot is my favorite Guardian!
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,audience,"I honestly believe Guardians of the Galaxy would never have worked without James Gunn. I have to reluctantly admit that Joss Whedon put it the best when he said: ""James [Gunn] is what makes me think it will work ... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart.""

The casting was fantastic. Each of the major actors fit their roles like a glove.

And it's another example of how music elevates a movie. GoG is he first MCU movie to actually have real songs (nostalgic 70's music) played throughout, setting the tone in the first 30 seconds with the melancholic I'm Not In Love by 10CC.

But what really sets this apart from all the others MCU movies before this is the mastery of the humor. I think this is the first Marvel movie that I busted my gut a bazillion times while watching. Nearly everything that comes out of Drax's mouth and so many quotable quotes it would fill up a cassette tape.

It is so apropos that James Gunn was tapped to reboot Suicide Squad. I hope his R rated version kills at the box office and makes Kevin Feige reconsider his stupid ""only PG-13"" for MCU movies (except Deadpool 3) rule.

""We are Groot."""
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,audience,"I love this movie. I can't say much more than this is a great movie. So witty and funny and just great. It is heartfelt and cute and really funny. I love the way Chris Pratt decides to create this character of ""Star Lord"". Super good film."
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,audience,The greatest futuristic PG-13 movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,audience,"Fun, great story, solid character development. Great movie."
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,critic,"
It's filled with one-liners, sight gags and funny moments that play off the more standard blockbuster-style action and battle scenes.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,critic,"
Contains all the excitement and adventure one would expect from a Marvel superhero movie, but the glue that holds this ragtag band of outlaws together is the humor.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,critic,"
May not necessarily be the movie event of the Summer but it's very likely one of the best Marvel-based cinematic adventures yet.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,critic,"
Gunn knows not to take the material too seriously, that a fun space adventure such as this should be exactly that: fun and adventurous.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,critic,"
Guardians of the Galaxy is great reminder that not all superhero comic book films have to be dark and moody.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,critic,"
Combining huge, spectacle-scale special effects, giant practical sets, and a massive scale, Guardians also works on a narrative level, and as the story of strange, unique, very human-even when they're not-characters.

James Gunn has taken a group of characters that the majority didn't care about two years ago and made them guaranteed fan favourites in a movie that's not only one of the most awesome Marvel movies yet, but also 2014's best.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,critic,"
Very entertaining from the great actor selection, to the special effects, to the plot scheme.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,critic,"
The film marked Marvel Studios going full-on Marvel Comics, bringing with it the requisite band of multi-coloured misfits, whose intersecting character arcs - while occasionally incomplete - formed an alluring tapestry.

Guardians of the Galaxy goes galactic with a new kind of fun, freshness, and family, ready to rock the Marvel universe and yours.

Guardians of the Galaxy has laughs, space battles and a mouthy racoon. You don't need anything else in a summer blockbuster.

One my favorite Marvel movies for sure.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,critic,"
Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the funniest movies that has ever been based on a Marvel comic book series.
 "
Guardians of the Galaxy,92,92,critic,"
Gunn does a great job of preserving his wacky indie sensibilities and incorporating them seamlessly into a giant, crowd-pleasing blockbuster film, a feat that takes more finesse than his Troma-boy resume may lead you to believe he's capable of.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,audience,"Great performances from a Stella cast. Daniel Craig's  questionable accent is forgiven in this fun whodunnit. A good , not too much to think about,  light ,entertaining , family film."
Knives Out,97,92,audience,"A bit entertaining because it had many, many good templates that are better. The characters are flat and Craig is a total miscast. The one expression Ana de Armas is capable of becomes a bit boring after 30 minutes."
Knives Out,97,92,audience,"Great acting across the board, complemented perfectly by a thoughtful, twist heavy plot that left me unexpectedly grinning by the end credits."
Knives Out,97,92,audience,"A phenomenal and intriguing whodunnit movie. Amazing story, splendid cinematography, and an absolutely delightful cast"
Knives Out,97,92,audience,"The modern day Agatha Christie tale of a millionaire who dies under mysterious circumstances. An all-star cast lead by Daniel Craig as Detective Benoit Blanc. The first 30-45 minutes the film really grips you and throws a lot of information your way. It's a roller coaster of a ride with humor, various storylines, and character introductions. The film is fast paced and for 130 minutes, flies by fairly quickly (with the exception of about midway into the film, where 2-3 characters are then solely focused on). I found the film to drag a bit during this portion but then the third act makes up for it with the reveal. A fun ride that I would be more than happy to ride again as well as see another story with Detective Blanc if Craig or Director Rian Johnson were so inclined to spin another tale for us."
Knives Out,97,92,audience,Awesome plot and very entertaining.
Knives Out,97,92,audience,"Absolutely brilliant! Cast, script, plot. We need more films like this. A great rainy day film!"
Knives Out,97,92,audience,Must see if you like huis-clos type movies
Knives Out,97,92,audience,Great cast of actors. I loved the storyline and the wrap up at the end
Knives Out,97,92,audience,I absolutely loved the movie . It had a well thought plot with solid performances supporting it . I definitely recommend you to see it.
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
Knives Out is a great antidote to the Oscar contenders and family fare that dominate this time of year. It's a purely fun time at the movies thanks to its strong story and fantastic performances.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
It's an old-fashioned set-up but slowly echoes of modern-day issues of immigration, deportation and white entitlement are introduced to add edge to the story.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
It's highly unlikely you're going to get through the movie without it completely getting its hooks into you.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
A predictable whodunit that seems to want to act as homage to the great mystery features of the past, but ends up feeling like a recycled plot from a lesser Agatha Christie novel.
 "

It gets goofier when the explanations unfold, yet the resolution and the parting shots are incredibly satisfying.

Rian Johnson proves himself to be one of contemporary cinema's most creative, inspired, disciplined, and downright entertaining filmmakers working today.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
This modern twist on an old classic understands that the genre's formulas are fertile ground on which to hang strident critiques of privilege and class.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
Rian Johnson (""Looper"") delivers a star-studded romp that rises above the standard ""Clue"" whodunnit by revealing the culprit early on, then watching the aftermath.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
Rian Johnson's Knives Out is an energetic blast, not only a landmark undertaking in skill, craft, nuance, and entertaining hilarity but makes a confident and exceptional call to be considered as one of the best films of the year.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
A knowing nudge-wink that leans heavily into the genre's well-worn threads before pulling the rug out from underneath you repeatedly, Knives Out is at once a glowing tribute and a smart re-tooling of the formula by Johnson.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
In its criticism of the rich for their avarice, xenophobia and general lack of humanity, Knives Out turns out to be more than a run-of-the-mill mystery yarn.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
The all-star cast takes turns chewing the scenery. Daniel Craig nearly steals the film as Benoit Blanc. If film fans are wondering if there is life after James Bond for Daniel Craig, the answer is a resounding YES.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
The resolution...seems a long time coming, and it isn't quite the out-of-left-field surprise you might have hoped for. Still, writer/director Rian Johnson keeps his audience sufficiently off-balance to make things interesting.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
Knives Out is not only a throwback to classic murder mysteries, but a well-calibrated genre exercise truly meant for these troubling times. Though the text feels retro, the subtext feels unapologetically contemporary.
 "
Knives Out,97,92,critic,"
Knives Out is a brilliant whodunnit film that is so much fun to unwrap and piece together. With a stellar cast, some killer humor, and a mild political undertone - it's surely set to entertain everyone.

If you like mystery novels, you will love this film, otherwise... you will love it too. [Full review in Spanish]

Noelle,54,57,audience,"Don't listen to the haters, this is a good, light-hearted, funny christmas movie. If you liked ""Elf"" you'll like this."
Noelle,54,57,audience,"Ce film est magnifique à regarder et le talent d'actrice d'Anna Kendrick est toujours parfait , c'est désormais mon film de Noël préféré je le conseille vraiment :) ."
Noelle,54,57,audience,"Charming, hopeful and joyful."
Noelle,54,57,audience,So many political and social agendas.
Noelle,54,57,audience,"By goodness. This movie could've been special. Anna Kendrick in this movie is the best character I've ever seen from her. And yes I've seen pitch perfect. Her jollyness is phenomenal and you need really really good acting to make it not look fake or not genuine. I believe she is being very genuine because she knows she's going to be in the history books for Disney Christmas movies. But everything else in this movie sucks. I'm sorry, not very jolly but it's true. Bill hader feels like he's collecting a pay check. Maybe that's just his character but I'm not getting any Christmas spirit from him. Even the detective dude and his kid are bad. They ooze cringe and takes away from the movie. Now if this was the Santa clause with Tim Allen and instead of him it's Anna Kendrick, it would be fantastic. The writing feels rushed and a cash grab. To me the only person taking this movie ""seriously"" is Anna Kendrick. Her performance is so over the top Christmas cheer that she deserves better. Gosh dang it Disney."

Noelle,54,57,audience,Rating: 7/10.  79/100
Noelle,54,57,audience,Ana Kendrick delivers a charming performance in this cute but predictable Christmas movie. The visual effects were terrible but the movie was still mostly enjoyable. 
Noelle,54,57,audience,surprised that this is a very touching movie with comedic bits! A really nice movie for the holidays!
Noelle,54,57,audience,"funny, heart-warming & current -- shows the true meaning of Christmas."
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Switch the Christmas tree lights on, grab some hot chocolate, wrap up in a blanket and enjoy this charming festive film!

Noelle,54,57,critic,"
A predictable affair with very little to leave anyone hooked. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
You'll have forgotten every last thing about Noelle by next Christmas, but that's almost a plus side to its flimsy charm - those baubles won't put themselves up.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
The proceedings are all so enthusiastic that one is easily charmed. And gosh darn it, but Kendrick is swell and so darn likable.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Kendrick twinkles. ""Noelle"" doesn't.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
If you're looking to placate some rowdy children or cranky grandparents this holiday season, then Noelle will hit the spot. But if you're looking for a new Christmas tradition, Santa's sister can't deliver - at least, not in the ways we'd wished for.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
If you grew up on Disney Channel original movies and/or love Hallmark Holiday films, this is a MUST WATCH. Otherwise, if you are still interested, continue reading.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Over all, Noelle is subpar - but it's silly, harmless fun. It's so forgettable it'll be virtually erased from your memory five minutes after the end credits roll.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
...an appealing premise that's employed to passable yet rarely enthralling effect by Lawrence...
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Noelle wears its heart on its sleeve, but for Christmas movies, that's rarely a bad thing. Thanks to committed performances from the cast, it overcomes a fairly basic plot.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Noelle isn't the kind of cinematic present that is wrapped in the finest paper bearing colorful bows and ribbons. It's the gift your aunt and uncle wrapped in old newspaper. However, you'll be happy with what you find inside.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
This entry is the most colorful and traditionally jolly of the newcomers and as such, pretty silly.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Noelle is a movie I can see myself watching every holiday season, like Elf and The Santa Clause, Anna Kendrick is instantly likable and charming.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Whatever your idea of a sentimental connect-the-dots Christmas comedy is, this is sub that.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
'Noelle' is reheated egg nog that has lost its joyful flavor.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Noelle's fun and likeable leads in Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader, plus its charming and heartwarming message gratefully save it from being a lump of coal.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Disney focuses its crowd-pleasing hive mind on the world of Hallmark movies, with surprisingly strong results.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
[The] script relies too much on Christmas-themed puns ... and a narrative that is predictable and dimwitted.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Make some hot chocolate, throw on some comfy PJs, and put ""Noelle"" on for a breezy Saturday morning watch. After that, it won't be long before it disappears into the pathos of the Disney engine and off your radar for good.
 "
Noelle,54,57,critic,"
Xmas comedy has predictable storylines, positive messages.

Klaus,94,97,audience,"This is an absolutely amazing movie, it definitely made me cry and smile with joy in a particularly scene, and I felt joyous and emotional throughout the movie. This movie may start off a bit odd but later on it becomes amazing. This movie has demonstrated the best way to tell the origin story of Santa Claus which I really enjoyed, I'll give it a rating of 100%, it's a perfect movie for Christmas."
Klaus,94,97,audience,Need more movies in this animation style its gorgeous
Klaus,94,97,audience,"The main characters are very successfully executed especially in terms of sympathy. Nice thematic and literal connections to Christmas. Generally, very well done."
Klaus,94,97,audience,"It's one of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen!
At first I thought it would be dumb, but omg it was AMAZING! The story was awesome (I won't give any spoilers) and there were parts that made me laugh so hard and parts that made me cry. I don't usually cry during movies, but I'm sitting here writing this review with tears in my eyes. I think it is going to become a new movie to watch every Christmas with my family"
Klaus,94,97,audience,Holy Cow. This is potentially my favorite movie of the year so far. This is an absolutely gorgeously made film and has such a sweet story.
Klaus,94,97,audience,"Beautiful animation movie! Without all the cgi stuff, KLAUS gives us an hand-drawn animation film but an extra class and quality.

Of course had to win the Oscar for best animation picture and its so good in so many ways.

Despite everything at the beginning We love all the characters and also the grey town.

A very sincere film which give us the trully Christmas message.

Klaus: ""A true selfless act always sparks another."""
Klaus,94,97,audience,This is very heart warming movie 😍
Klaus,94,97,audience,I like it a lot well done
Klaus,94,97,audience,What a wonderful heart warming Christmas movie beautifully animated. PRetty sure this will become one of those Christmas classics.
Klaus,94,97,audience,"I find it a crime that this wonderfully animated, funny, and emotional film didn't win Best Animated Feature. Presenting a unique, albeit less fantasized telling about the origins of Santa Claus, Klaus' charm and innocence make it a very enjoyable soon-to-be-classic Christmas movie."
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
An engaging re-imagining of the Santa Claus origin mythos is handled beautifully.

Bold and creative, Klaus should be highlighted for its artistic achievement. [Full review in Spanish]

A heartwarming take on the Christmas origin story. You will alternate between laughing and being moved by the film.

Klaus is the surprise of this awards season. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
Beyond the approachable storytelling, fun cast, and revisionist mythology, however, lies the stunning craftsmanship of the animation itself.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
Instead, it's a clever, not-too-sentimental Hatfields v McCoys take on the legend of Santa Claus.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
An engaging revisionist tale, destined to become another Christmas classic.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
While Klaus has a number of the same faults you'll find in a number of run-of-the-mill animated family movies . . . , more animated works could stand to take a cue from its visual creativity.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
A cut above the average seasonal tale due to its impressive cast and visual inventiveness, this film is full of unexpected references which will entertain older viewers but don't get in the way of the plot.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
The fluidity, the smoothness of the 3D animation...people, it looks good, incredible.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
This should be eligible for Best Animated Picture.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
Destined to be added to the yearly holiday viewing rotation, Klaus is worth writing to Santa about.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
The animation is beautiful, the story is beautiful, the music is beautiful.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
Sure you know where the story is going, but the journey is delightful nonetheless.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
Essentially a heartwarming tale of a millennial entrepreneur disrupting the status quo through social enterprise, Klaus is a pure pleasure to watch.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
Although Klaus takes a while for its story to get interesting, it is saved by its breathtaking animation and emotional message at its core.
 "
Klaus,94,97,critic,"
Its tempo is uneven, and not all characters convincing, yet Klaus relies mostly on storytelling and a back-to-basics visual style to achieve its aim rather than marketing sensibilities.

Lady and the Tramp,66,50,audience,"I just didn't like it and found it hard to sit through 
The dogs attitudes /personalities didn't match the original very well. For example the original lady seemed more open hearted,, innocent and naive. The original was way better imo"
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,audience,"This movie is full with this politicaly correct non sense, nothing from the cartoon.... Why they didn't do like in the lion king...  Nope we need to change becouse we are sick people."
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,audience,"Disney's live-action adaptation of 'Lady and the Tramp' is basically a copy of the original film with nothing added or changed except for some tiny elements. The removal of the siamese cat scene was a great change, but the way the film was directed seemed like it belonged on the Disney Channel instead of the theaters or streaming."
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,audience,"This live-action remake offers humor and plenty of heart for younger viewers, and while the dogs are adorable to watch, the 1955 animated original will still be preferred."
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,audience,Tender story with beautiful scenes set in an imaginary past where beautiful young people of two races marry and have a baby together. Very good escapism and message. I'm catching up on movies my children and grandchildren are now too old to have seen! It's fun.
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,audience,"Full of charm and cast was fantastic. Anyone claiming it was ruined by added diversity and the exclusion of the extremely offensive Siamese cat song is either uneducated, white, or both. Adding diversity didn't take anything away from the retelling of the original film and I see the heart in it. Would very much recommend."
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,audience,Garbage. Not a faithful rendition of a Disney classic.
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,audience,more in tune with today's culture but mostly forgettable 
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,audience,Why make a remake that works worse in a realist animation style at all when the origonal is better.
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,audience,I tried to watch it but couldn't get past the historical inaccuracy.  The story was set in 1909.  Why was this movie even remade if the filmmakers can't stick to the original story??  Just make new stories with fairytale places that don't exist instead of rewriting history.
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
The dogs don't have the range of expression their cartoon counterparts brought to the story but, as we saw in The Lion King, the technology that brings them to life is state of the art if not quite the magical experience you might hope for.

Despite their best efforts, Disney cannot make what was already spectacular better. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
From cute rambunctious puppy to comedy dogs with one-liners and some mild peril, director Charlie Bean has kept this pure Disney, and it's sweet and nice and kids should be charmed.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
There are moments of solid humour and action, and the romance itself is adorable even if the film feels overly soft and squishy.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
It's no classic, but it's easy viewing for families that might be starting to tear their hair out.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
It's pretty well done, even charming in parts: the question is, did it need to be done at all?
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
It's less a faithful translation of an animated classic than a nostalgic throwback to the era of Babe and Homeward Bound.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
There is something abjectly horrifying about watching these dogs talk, with their CG jaws just slightly too fluid, too capable of creating round ""Os"" and the like.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
The film trots along at its own speed, full of low-stakes skits and romantic early 20th century nostalgia.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
A perfectly watchable, family-friendly adaptation with charming canine stars, but like 2019's The Lion King, it's lacks the magic of the hand drawn animated original.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
Charlie Bean's film knows how to capture the heart of the original, but not its soul, and it is as imperfect and harmless as it is efficient and enjoyable. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
This latest remake is about as mediocre - no better, no worse - as all the others that preceded it.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
This Tramp doesn't really stamp a fresh personality on a story already told well. But it also doesn't embarrass itself compared to the original and it's got a shaggy charm of its own.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
By the time they're yukking it up over an impromptu riverboat ride, it's hard not to root for the spaghetti-smeared kiss we know is coming.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
I'm addicted to Disney+...and Justin Theroux is Dog Jesus.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
Lady and the Tramp doesn't need to exist any more than any other Disney live-action (or photoreal) remake does. But if they are going to make them anyway, it would be nice if more of them would do what this one does.
 "
Lady and the Tramp,66,50,critic,"
Set at the turn of the last century and shot in the beautiful fin de siècle neighbourhoods of Savannah Georgia it has all the points for nostalgia, but its inclusiveness and tone are in line with life today.

Doctor Sleep,78,89,audience,Now I know why it is called 'Doctor Sleep'... Zzz z z z z....
Doctor Sleep,78,89,audience,"I didn't read the book so I went in to this blind and I did enjoy it; however, in the grand scheme of things, I came out of this movie the same way I went going in to it: a sequel to THE SHINING was unnecessary. The film doesn't take anything away from the original (thank goodness) and actually revisits it quite a bit towards the beginning and end, which was very enjoyable! I heard nothing but praise for Rebecca Ferguson beforehand and while I thought she was very good, I thought prior reviews gave her a little too much credit. McGregor I wanted to like at times as an older version of Dan (not Danny) Torrance. Sometimes I felt he worked, while other times I didn't. My favorite role was probably by Alex Essoe who's in a handful of scenes and to not spoil it, I won't say which part she plays. Overall, it was a fun, although long ride. The first 15-20 minutes and the third act are where I got my money's worth."
Doctor Sleep,78,89,audience,"While topping The Shining is quite a challenge, Mike Flanagan's Doctor Sleep comes awfully close, and is a whole lot of fun to watch"
Doctor Sleep,78,89,audience,2021-2-25 This horror movie was so creepy with a complete story which was not seen in most of the horror movies. So  glad that it was just a movie and I am a muggle.
Doctor Sleep,78,89,audience,Normally when 80% have enjoyed a film I am in the same group. This film was very disappointing. Firstly the subject matter of young children being abducted and killed for their 'spirit' did not sit well with me. A strong cast helped the film and there were a few moments of class. Large parts of the movie could have been cut. The main problem though was the complete change of tone from chilling horror movie to something that would sit better on an netflix series for teenagers. Not that that would have been a problem in itself.
Doctor Sleep,78,89,audience,"Doctor Sleep is a pretty good watch!  It stays loyal to the source material, providing a lot of fan service.  With the long runtime, there are some slow moments.  Otherwise it is a solid movie with great acting and visuals!"
Doctor Sleep,78,89,audience,"I do not understand the appeal to people who like this movie. I love The Shining and I'm a huge Stephen King fan. Honestly the guy can do no wrong usually but this movie was a waste of time. 

I think much of the appeal of The Shining is that we didn't know much about the mental powers. The audience didn't know anything at all aside from the brief explanation. 
This movie digs in just a little too far and ruins the mystery and reveals it's not as cool as we thought it was and is, in fact, pretty cliche. 
And the chick with the hat? Came across as some 90s trendy goth kit from Hot Topic instead of some timeless queen of power and strength and evil. 
Just didn't work as a story the way it was laid out, offered no scares, no real suspense and very little else to keep the story on track. 
And honestly the process of beathing in people's ‘power' is as boring and cliched as you can get. 
King is better than this story. The truth is that maybe The Shining should have been left alone. Some of the unanswered questions were what made the story such a classic. 
I know that King hated the screen adaptation of the book but it's remarkable and amazing on its own without being compared to the book."
Doctor Sleep,78,89,audience,it was good and kripit but good
Doctor Sleep,78,89,audience,Stephen King you never disappoint
Doctor Sleep,78,89,audience,"By itself, the movie is meh, but it's not a sequel to The Shining. The tone didn't match the first film at all and the events of it practically didn't matter until the last scene. From a plot standpoint, it felt like the beginning and end were written before the middle, giving it a disconnected vibe and underdeveloped (potentially) interesting characters. The parts I found most unbearable was the unnecessarily brutal murder of a baseball boy and a shootout that served no purpose when almost every character in the movie has some type of magic power. All in all, I would never watch it again, but I didn't hate it so much I turned it off. That's about the highest praise I can give for what I just saw."
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
A Kubrickian xerox with soul and dark beauty.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
Doctor Sleep often feels like a tribute to The Shining but brings enough of its own ideas on the effects of childhood trauma and the lingering pain of a shattered family to add richness and originality to the movie.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
As a reconciliation between Kubrick and King, Doctor Sleep doesn't quite work, but as a dark horror fantasy, there's a lot to love.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
The slow clap here goes to Mike Flanagan who wrote, directed and edited the film ... The book, like most of King's works, is a beast, and Flanagan, unlike many before and surely many after him, does not let the beast get the better of him.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
A chilling, gripping adaptation with some terrific performances and several standout sequences. It doesn't quite stick the landing thanks to an overreliance on replicating what's come before, but it's still well worth checking out.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
Doctor Sleep is a good psychological thriller with touches of terror, a bit of drama, and covered with a dreamlike veneer that allows its director to show off his staging in several sequences. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
Flanagan has done the impossible by delivering a film that works both as a sequel to King's novel and Kubrick's adaptation, but even without that clarifier it can still be considered a modern classic.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
There's simply no subtlety in the horror.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
Really slow but captivating at the same time.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
Doctor Sleep serves as a thought provoking and logical progression diving into generational traumas and owning your gifts before it's too late.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
I like Doctor Sleep. A lot. It scared me, moved me, fascinated me, horrified me. It takes chances and goes places that very few genre films dare to go.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
A mesmerizing collision of fantasy and reality staged atop a bedrock of mythology.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
This is not a retread of a crazy man in a haunted house, but a well-paced drama about the traumas of childhood abuse, the remnants of the psychic energy all abuse holds.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
Doctor Sleep is a film with a near-impossible brief and crushing audience expectations. It delivers on those conditions marvellously, and presents one of the smartest, most effective supernatural thrillers of its type in recent years.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
As a standalone horror film, Doctor Sleep is successful enough. The film is a tale of the supernatural, struggles with substance abuse and trying to overcome the damage of a crippling childhood.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
It's a fascinating idea, taking from both Kubrick and King in order to make a composite of events and themes. Flanagan, however, just ends up with a contradiction.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
Stands on its own merits with a balancing act that stays faithful to the madness of The Shining but injects an air of horror mastery.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
There's not much that makes it a 'Must-See' movie, but there are a few elements that make it worthwhile.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
Shockingly good, rich with psychological depth, meaningful characters, an exquisitely modulated tone and a few moments of riveting terror.
 "
Doctor Sleep,78,89,critic,"
Doctor Sleep brilliantly bridges the disparities between both of King's source novels and Kubrick's adaptation.

Interstellar,72,86,audience,Une B.O qui me fascine et une fin qui m'émeut a chaque visionnage 😭
Interstellar,72,86,audience,best science fiction movie of all time
Interstellar,72,86,audience,Love this movie. Christopher Nolan did a masterpiece.
Interstellar,72,86,audience,"As one cannot wrap their head around the universe, one cannot wrap their head around Interstellar... it's insane. You name it, this movie executed it flawlessly, something no other movie has ever done before. Nobody will ever be able to explain how good it is; one just needs to watch it."
Interstellar,72,86,audience,"Did you ever miss your family? Well, this movie uses science fiction to ask you that question (and gives you its own answer on the way) 10/10"
Interstellar,72,86,audience,"At one point in this film, a man has to wait for many tedious years inside a spacecraft on his own. It turns out that watching the film will result in closer identification with that man's emotions than you would ever have thought possible. Christ it's long and boring! Nolan has made some excellent films but this isn't one of them. It's so hung up on its ideas that he forgot to make a decent movie. An overly sentimental, pretentious, bloated mess."
Interstellar,72,86,audience,"Incredible!
Nolan create an emotional movie about a future that not (maybe) so far.
Hans Zimmer show you the sound of that future.

Amazing"
Interstellar,72,86,audience,"I usually don't like Sci-Fi movies but this was phenomenal. Almost left me speechless. If you haven't watched this yet, do so, now."
Interstellar,72,86,audience,"Interstellar is a movie that will challenge your brain to think. That being said, it is a beautiful masterpiece. This space-age dystopian themed movie is played off excellently. Nolan and his team did an amazing job to capture the beauty of space and simplify it for us viewers. The quality of the film is stunning, and everything seems so polished yet rugged at the same time. The amount of real science that was poured into this film is immaculate. Nolan and his team, got some notable scientists on their team, to help create the most realistic space scenes and events. 
All of this adds up to create a realistic, yet breathtaking film. So if you appreciate film or love space I would highly, highly recommend this movie."
Interstellar,72,86,audience,"Interstellar may very well be Christopher Nolan best film or one of he's best. Between the great storytelling, camera work an a incredible score. Interstellar will take you on a journey beyond space."
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
Nolan reaches for the stars with beautifully composed shots and some mind-bending special effects, but the dime store philosophy of the story never achieves lift off.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
Audiences are sure to lose their suspensions of disbelief over the nearly impenetrable climax.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
...an often insanely ambitious science fiction epic that that remains mesmerizing for most of its (admittedly overlong) running time...
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
Scientists will debate, theologians will contemplate, philosophers will wonder, and cinema lovers will bask in the glory of another remarkable Christopher Nolan achievement.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
A big-budget reprise of ideas Nolan has been exploring since the beginning of his career. Not only is it a film about the passage of time, it's also a film about memory.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
None of these characters feel fully-fledged... for a film so rife with schmaltzy musings on the meaning of life, it's alarming how lacking it is in this department.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
Interstellar is not Christopher Nolan's best film but what I will say is that you can't deny his ambition.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
As spectacular as it is flawed.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
Interstellar is not only a grand space adventure worthy of the big screen, it's also a powerfully emotional story about the bond between a father and daughter, and how that love can drive one to attempt the impossible.

Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
One of the boldest science-fiction movies I've ever seen, both in narrative and visual terms. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
It was a blockbuster movie-going experience.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
I guess the take away is all you need is love... and morse code?
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
Interstellar is, all in all, a very fine science fiction film.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
Interstellar is 120 minutes of good movie stuffed into 170 minutes.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
Interstellar is Nolan at his most humane. It's a good look for him.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
Overall, Interstellar looks nice but ultimately lacks substance. Nolan essentially loses his way by going to space.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
The space voyage is easily one of Nolan's most thought-provoking films yet. It's definitely his most ambitious.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
As far as a masterful visualization of space and an exploration of profound theory, it belongs on a shortlist of must see films which it's comparably akin to... But Nolan's film falls short in other realms, namely the human component.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
It's as grand as it is introspective and as grounded as it is existential. By the end of the nearly three-hour running time - it goes by in a flash - you feel as if you've experienced something that is so rarely captured on film.
 "
Interstellar,72,86,critic,"
Christopher Nolan more than deserves however much money the studios are willing to keep giving him to make these brainy beautiful blockbusters.
 "
Gravity,95,80,audience,"It's a very visually stimulating movie. It's beautiful to look at. But there's not much going on here. Even at it's very short run-time, it still felt too long. Clooney's character floating away was absurd. There was no force pulling him away. And yes, I am aware that centripetal force could have pulled him away but there were several shots that show they obviously were not spinning so that's not a valid theory here. They killed off Clooney's character just because they needed some drama. The rest of the movie is just things going wrong over and over and the protagonist finding ways to narrowly overcome it on the way to a predictable ending with some pretty forced emotion. I enjoyed the first 30 mins but my interest wore out after Clooney's character was inexplicably killed off."
Gravity,95,80,audience,"Put me with the group who thought this sucked. Won't give it a 1, the cgi is good enough to least boost it to a 2. Boy man, was this over hyped."
Gravity,95,80,audience,A lot of my friends told me to watch it but when i watch i disappointed!!
Gravity,95,80,audience,"Visually stunning and impeccably produced, the film creates tension from the get go and keeps building and building throughout the movie. The average version of this film would have been simply a space disaster narrative, however their are themes of loneliness, grief and overcoming adversity, which are all intertwined into the story, so credit must go to Alfonso Cuarón."
Gravity,95,80,audience,Spoiler alert: Such an emotional and powerful portrayal of the loss of a child and the horror and beauty of the healing process that a parent then goes through on their journey to a life beyond loss. Wow.
Gravity,95,80,audience,"These other 5 star reviews must be fake! 8 of our family members watched this on a large outdoor screen with great sound effects. Probably one of the worst we ever seen. It was one of the most dull and boring movies we have ever watched. Bullock won a nomination for her acting? Are you kidding? Mostly heavy breathing, grunting and terrible one liner cliche comments? Academy awards have been so off the mark with their awards over the last 10 years. Is the quality of the rest of their movie offing's so bad that this is the best of the lot? What an embarrassment movie!"
Gravity,95,80,audience,I cannot even begin to say how crappy this movie is!
Gravity,95,80,audience,"While the CGI defies gravity, so does the acting, and that's why this film looks good and is good."
Gravity,95,80,audience,Gravity's greatness comes from its heart-racing premise and incredible special effects. Director Alfonso Cuaron has crafted a true suspenseful masterpiece with this very well acted and cleverly written story about overcoming adversities.
Gravity,95,80,audience,"I remember deciding to watch this movie in cinemas because critics were all praising it as one of the best movies of that year. I watched it in IMAX 3D and remember being blown away by the movie. It won: Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing at the Oscars which is a lot of awards. The synopsis is ""Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission. Her commander is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney), helming his last flight before retirement. Then, during a routine spacewalk by the pair, disaster strikes: The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Ryan and Matt stranded in deep space with no link to Earth and no hope of rescue. As fear turns to panic, they realize that the only way home may be to venture further into space"". I've decided to rewatch it on a whim but this time on my home TV. The question is if this movie is overrated or deserving of its accolades. 

Let's talk about the concept first, it's great. A survival movie in space, with no monsters or anything like that, is such a great concept that has not been done before or since its release. The movie perfectly illustrates the horror but also the beauty of space in a way that surprisingly meshes well together. 

On that note of the beauty, the cinematography is amazing. A lot of amazing cinematography is usually using real shots but Gravity does it all through CGI. It shouldn't work as CGI is quite obvious and bad CGI can even take you out of the movie but Gravity doesn't ""fall"" in that category. There are a lot of gorgeous shots that feel like paintings and this is partially thanks to the amazing visual effects. The set design for the space ships are claustrophobic and further emphasise the loneliness within this movie. The score is great and elevates the tension in the scenes where the score is prominent but during the more hopeful scenes, the score is more orchestral and beautiful. The movie doesn't rely on the score too much and sometimes just lets the silence of space or the breathing of the astronauts to suck the audience into the movie and it works.  

The movie is visually spectacular but what about the characters and story? The movie is revolved around Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who is our point of view character. For the most part, the movie makes us care about her because of the situation she is in and that is fine. However, the director (Alfonso Cuarón) decided to include a scene that elaborates on Ryan Stone's backstory on Earth. This is a good choice as it makes the audience more sympathetic with her and more understanding of why her personality is what it is or why she does certain actions or choices in the movie. Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) is a sort of anchor character that support Ryan throughout the movie. He has a contrasting personality to Ryan as he is funny and charismatic yet due to being more experienced is also one who guides Ryan. I like the dynamic between the two of them and when both of them are interacting it's funny or heartwarming. 

I also have to praise Sandra Bulluck as she does a great job in carrying this movie. Her performance whenever she is struggling in space feels genuine and I can feel the fear and panic just from the tone of her voice. She also delivers in the emotional moments that bring the scene to life. She was deserving of that best actress nomination at the Oscars. George Clooney does a pretty good job as well. Although, he mostly just plays Matt as the witty and charming guy. I do like it when the two are together, George overshadows Sandra which sounds weird but that is exactly what it should be in terms of who their characters are and what the plot is asking.

I don't have many flaws with the movie that aren't just nitpicking but I do think the fact that Dr Ryan Stone seems to constantly panic in the first half of the movie kind of weird. Dr Ryan Stone just seems to not know the basics of being in space so know it all Matt Kowalsky constantly has to tell her stuff that I think she should've known. From a movie perspective, I get why this choice was made so that the audience can easily understand things about space but it could've handled way better in my opinion. Additionally, we get some backstory on Dr Ryan Stone but we don't get anything on Matt which I find a bit odd and lessens the impact of a certain scene. Unfortunately, I do think a lot of the impact this movie has is sadly lost because I am not watching it in a cinema. You could argue that with a lot of movies but for me watching this throughout certainly made me think ""this would be way better in a cinema"". 

In conclusion, I still really enjoyed the movie. Yes, the movie is impressive because of its style but in terms of substance, it certainly is lacking. However, the movie is just so visually spectacular that I don't mind it. Furthermore, a lot of great movies such as ""Dunkirk"" and ""1917"" do similar things to Gravity and they are both great movies as well. Gravity still is one of the best space movies to have come out in the last 20 years. I feel this movie accomplishes a lot with visual effects and space cinematography. A lot of people might not be talking about this movie anymore but for me, I certainly will still remember it."
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
A few twists and unpredictable scenarios pop up to keep the intrigue alive for an impressive length, but a lack of solid character development and plot cheapens the momentum.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
Gravity doesn't so much immerse you in its cinematic experience as it simply takes you there and sets you down among the stars.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
[Gravity] is not just a spectacle that shows us the beauty and horrors of space but also a survival tale and a tale about grief.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
As a sci-fi geek, Gravity naturally ticks all the boxes that I expect from a sci-fi film and reminds me why I fell in love with the genre in the first place.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
By turns chilling, engaging, and breathtaking, Gravity juxtaposes the serenity of extreme quiet with moments of swirling, chaotic terror as it hurtles through space.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
At the end of the getaway, Gravity is a film that will be talked about for many years to come, and not because of the realistic approach to space, but because of its technical originality. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
It was well made.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
I was never bored.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
Cuarón has created an absolutely singular experience that is a marvel to watch.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
Cuaron's journey into space is a great achievement, pushing the limits of what we can do with technology on screen and hinting at where it can go in the future.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
Bullock's dizzyingly complex performance in a film that is as thrilling as it is culturally resonant makes Gravity something hella special.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
It literally takes your breath away, yet it's a triumph of weightless entertainment sans gravitas. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Escape doesn't get much better.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
It will reinvigorate your love of movies.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
There are some truly incredible sequences in here, and for a studio tentpole it's quite original, but don't expect a masterpiece.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
A wondrous experience, a space epic on a grand and rare scale that is one of this year's can't miss films.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
Believe the hype.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
It's unlike anything you've ever seen - full of breathtaking visuals that should be witnessed on the biggest screen you can find.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
This won't be the film many were expecting but as pure spectacle cinema, Gravity is breathtaking.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
By the time Gravity concludes at the end of its ninety minutes, we are exhausted. The filmmakers have convinced us that we are part of what we are witnessing, making for one of the most tense and intense movies imaginable.
 "
Gravity,95,80,critic,"
A singular survival tale in space, Gravity is an experience that marvels and mesmerizes.
 "
The Martian,91,91,audience,The Martian is an exciting film but is sometimes confusing to the viewer. The Martian leaves you entertained for the whole movie. This movie does have some plot holes to it. For example a conflict would happen but then be disregarded. Overall this film in enjoying!
The Martian,91,91,audience,"The martian is one of the most, thrilling, intense, and down right great fun. This is truly a classic."
The Martian,91,91,audience,Another masterpiece from Ridley Scott. Surprisingly funny. The cast was great. Donald Glover's performance is especially underrated.
The Martian,91,91,audience,"An intelligent and entertaining space adventure in which Science is the hero. Matt Damon delivers a strong performance in this thrilling spectacle. It's a tough, survival movie and yet one that depicts a refreshingly optimistic view of the future. It feels like a long movie but the meandering pace worked for me and fit well with story. A must watch."
The Martian,91,91,audience,"Solid film about the high-stakes dangers of a near-future manned mission to Mars. The cast and acting are stellar, as is the cinematography. Based on the book by Andy Weir, the film tried to put everything from the book into the film so sometimes it can feel like too much is happening and you can't truly connect deeply with the characters aside from a few emotional moments. Also slipped into a repetitive pattern of problem-solution, new problem-new solution. If you like feel-good sci-fi and can-do, death-winking cheekiness, check this flick out pronto."
The Martian,91,91,audience,"2021-3-1 The China part was kinda odd. Maybe they couldn't make  it more reasonable in the movie. So if you eat potatoes only, you're gonna  die in 2 years, but, of course, if you're positive as Mark Watney and had choices, you wouldn't treat your body that way. Would? Mentioned about positiveness and humour, what about a person who was positive and  humorous but suck at relationship?"
The Martian,91,91,audience,"A rollercoaster ride of excitement, humor and fucking science."
The Martian,91,91,audience,"The only space movie I can and will tolerate. Incredible film. Would trust Matt Damon to keep me alive on Mars, 10/10."
The Martian,91,91,audience,"Ridley Scott this time has adapted Andy Weir's best-selling novel of the same name. Which detailed a stranded astronaut's story to survive on Mars with the resources he has and botany skills to boot. Scripted by Drew Goddard of The Cabin in the Woods fame and starring Matt Damon in the central role of Mark Watney. All of this has come together to form one of Ridley Scott's best films for some time. Certainly at this point in time, his best film since American Gangster.

The story goes that a space crew is stationed on Mars, there to explore the Acidalia Planitia plain as part of their expedition. A storm rages which prompts them to leave, but not before Mark Watney played by Matt Damon is struck by a piece of a satellite antenna and is presumed dead by the crew. NASA gets wind of this and has a memorial service in his name, believing him to be dead. Sure enough, Watney survives but is in the risk of losing air.

Having managed to make it to to the base, he comes to the realisation that he is alone, with little food and contact with no-one. Therefore using a space log to update his activities, he plans to use his special botany skills and ingenuity to survive. To make contact in the hope that he can somehow escape and reunite with his crew and Earth itself. The film works on several levels. The cast themselves are part of an ensemble and all shine together in this film. From Matt Damon as our lead, a worn-down but cocky and confident individual, who you all root for to make it back home in the long run. To Jessica Chastain as the ship's commander Melissa Lewis, the authoritative and leading figure to her crew and all-out disco music fan. To Chiwetel Ejiofor as NASA's director of space missions who carries the burden on earth to bring Watney back safely. To Jeff Daniels director of NASA who is cautious and decisive to a fault, just to name a few.

 The film manages to be surprisingly funny even during the more sombre and dark moments. By no means is this film a comedy (as the Golden Globes believed it was…) nor is it out of place or sporadic. Which is a credit to Drew Goddard's script who possesses a successful track record of subtly blending drama and comedy together to significant effect. I think it is also a credit to Ridley Scott, who doesn't downplay or fight against the right tone for the film, but more flows with it. Sometimes a script and Scott's vision in the past would conflict disastrously – but here it's lighting in a bottle. The steps Watney takes to survive, whether growing potatoes in a confined space of dirt and faeces by using leftover rocket fuel to produce hydrogen or dismantling equipment and ship parts to make movement viable by the direction of NASA scientists; is fascinating to watch.

Not just because the audience know what's at stake, but the level of humourous insight renders any steps into dreariness; making it an excellent but reflective thrill ride of a film. Just watching the movie blending all those successful elements together marks it as a triumphant rendition of the novel itself and offers surprises along the way. This is undoubtedly a film that isn't there to make a grand, ultimate statement. Nor is it trying to be a deep, experience film like in the vein of 2001: a Space Odyssey or Interstellar but is just only an entertaining, enjoyable survival story. That has its moments of reflection and more than enough time for the audience to spend time with Watney on his journey to survive and also be in the company of a great cast to boot. To the power of the botanist and film director, this is definitely one of his best outings and reaffirms Ridley Scott as one of cinema's greatest storytellers."
The Martian,91,91,audience,"Nobody can build suspense quite like Ridley Scott. And he does it again here in one one of his best films. This is an excellent, beautiful movie. Even with the long run-time, it never drags."
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
A fun film, a space Western about the strength of the human spirit and the indomitable will. ""Interstellar"" tread similar thematic ground last year but did so without the humour, the cheesy 70's soundtrack or, most importantly, Matt Damon.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
It seems to understand that the quotidian of life in space as a lone man attempts to survive is as fascinating as any storm or explosion.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
The Martian is exactly the reason why we watch movies. It's fun, exciting, and a thrilling spectacle with deep emotional payoffs and strong performances from its all-star cast.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
Matt Damon's strong central performance anchors this compelling sci-fi adventure about a man stuck on Mars while the folks back home try to find an easy way to rescue him.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
When the bits of suspense arrive, they're handled with Scott's veteran expertise and Damon's sensational screen presence.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
[Damon] is supported by a top-flight cast that includes Jessica Chastain, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Aksel Hennie...
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
The screenplay, unhappily, has retained the general flatness of the scenes on Earth...Scott has a number of talented performers at his disposal, who struggle to make something of the oddly colorless and often drama-less dialogue...
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
An epic space adventure, a story of one man's determination, fighting for survival in the most hostile environment imaginable, an effects-driven tentpole, a small human story, and much more.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
It has to be said directly: The Martian is a very clever movie and perhaps the most intriguing science fiction movie that Ridley Scott has directed in a long time. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
It was fun, it was fluffy, it was entertaining, but I didn't think it was a great movie.

Once again, mixing tragedy and comedy is not something that everyone knows how to do. Scott has plenty of talent not to fall for fashion. And yet he does. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
A crowd pleaser for all ages that is fun but tense, meaty yet light, and about as inspiring as it gets.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
The Martian is a story about people working together but thinking for themselves. It is also a first class piece of cinematic entertainment...
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
The Martian is the movie we need right now.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
The Martian is a major return to form for Scott, who seems inspired by NASA's can-do spirit.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
Watney may be taking a bunch of giant steps for mankind, but The Martian merely tiptoes around other great films that take on a similar topic.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
The Martian consumes audiences from start to finish. Damon's witty performance makes the film both fun and intense while Scott's balance of Mars, Earth, emotion, politics, science and humor is an impressive and enthralling feat.
 "
The Martian,91,91,critic,"
""The Martian"" is this decade's ""Cast Away,"" but if ""Cast Away"" took place in a world that was constantly plugged in and online.

Furious 7,82,82,audience,when i see u again rest safe
Furious 7,82,82,audience,"Film inevitabilmente influenzato dalla prematura ed improvvisa morte di Paul Walker a cui viene riservato un addio da brividi con una colonna sonora diventata ormai famosissima.
Due scene clamorosamente spettacolari ed anche difficili da pensare; il lancio paracadutistico e il salto tra i grattacieli.
Nel finale la trama si appiattisce leggermente riducendosi ad un copione già visto."
Furious 7,82,82,audience,Furious 7 really had no point in this movie compared to 6 it is a fine fast and furious movie kinda wish this movie was better it would have been nice
Furious 7,82,82,audience,"the action as always is breath-taking, Jason Statham is a nice addition to the cast, the stunts are incredible and it has a really heart braking ending with Paul Walker that made me cry."

¡TOTALMENTE RECOMENDADA!

Furious 7,82,82,audience,"The movie is amazing, its nonstop action throughout and every sequence looks awesome. The story is great and the sendoff at the end for Paul was great. My favorite so far in the franchise."
Furious 7,82,82,audience,"You would think that a movie about a ragtag group of deviants who fight terrorists with their superior driving skills--and who live in a world with no rules of physics--would be horrible, but you would be wrong."

Furious 7,82,82,critic,"
Furious 7 is something to see, strictly for the pure adrenaline and entertainment.
 "
Furious 7,82,82,critic,"
The true shame is that, despite zero constraints on the magnitude of potential action sequences, few of the extravagant set pieces actually contain anything conceptually new.

Fast & Furious 7 certainly is the Ultimate tribute to Paul Walker; some of the scenes just make you want to cry...
 "
Furious 7,82,82,critic,"
After losing one of the stars in 2013, Furious 7 brings emotion as they always have.
 "
Furious 7,82,82,critic,"
Essentially an action-packed and thrilling adventure with a thread of humanity.

Despite the faults, Fast and Furious 7 is every bit as entertaining as its predecessors with an emotional weight that holds the film together for all the right reasons.
 "
Furious 7,82,82,critic,"
There's a sincerity here that packs a surprisingly emotional counterpoint to the action.
 "
Furious 7,82,82,critic,"
Watching Furious 7, you get the distinct impression that, when faced with a creative choice, the filmmakers paused to ask themselves, ""What's the most insane, over the top thing we can do here?"" Then they went ahead and did that.

[Delivers] entertaining stunt action and [combines] it with a fun plot that not only keeps its sense of humor, but also contains a good deal of heart and emotion.

""Furious 7"" is probably one of the most ridiculous non-stop action rides you'll see this year. It's also probably one of the few action films which will also reduce you to tears by its end.

Convoluted as the story is, the way they say goodbye to Paul was well done and really very poignant.

Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,audience,"Max Mad Fury Road is brilliant! The way it recreates and updates the post apocalyptic world from the original films is spectacular. And it's new story and characters make it stand out in ways the original(s) did not. The camera shots are thoughtful and unique. The colors are bright and genuine to life and along with the non-stop action, pull the viewer in making you feel like you're right there with the characters on screen. Even if you're not a fan of action movies the sheer artistry of Max Max Fury Road will demand your full attention (and make your jaw drop). All reboots should be this great.  Keep your fingers crossed for a sequel because you will want to see more (*and hopefully it will have the same actors because recasting the actors destroys a film's contiunity and it's character's integrity and appeal)."

In addition to being furiously entertaining and having new protagonists, watching this blockbuster is like going to the desert to see a special show by Monster truck, Slipknot and Cirque du Soleil. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,critic,"
This movie was just bonkers.
 "
Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,critic,"
It was great. I mean, this is how to do an action movie.
 "
Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,critic,"
Mad Max: Fury Road will be the film to beat for a long time coming, and the new high-water mark against which to judge action and blockbuster filmmaking. This is, quite simply, how it's done.
 "
Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,critic,"
It's a rare film that engages the mind while rocking the body. Miller's vision of a world consumed by its own greed, where water, gasoline, and bullets are the most precious commodities, seems even more relevant today than it did 30 years ago.
 "
Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,critic,"
As close to riding a rollercoaster you can experience while sitting in a movie theater.
 "
Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,critic,"
The entirety is a delicious assault on both your visual cortex and auditory system - a giant orchestral blend of machine engines roaring and wheels peeling combined with a booming overture of drums and guitar.
 "
Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,critic,"
Furiosa and the women are the heart and soul of Fury Road, championing female life and autonomy into something that could have easily been a popcorn flick for bros.
 "
Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,critic,"
Arty, gorgeous, exciting, compelling, and poignant all at once.
 "
Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,critic,"
It's something awesome. It's all hot orange and brown, the glamour of the punishing desert wind, it is completely OTT and it can't go five minutes without an explosion and I loved it.
 "
Mad Max: Fury Road,97,86,critic,"
Miller's magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass. It's evidence that all-out action need not be reduced to ""dumb fun."" It's brilliant. It's glorious. It is Maxcellent.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,audience,"this is an exciting movie but if you are watching the entire X-men series in chronological order it doesn't quite fit in. Characters who are killed in this movie are inexplicably alive later in their time period. Other aspects of the plot do not align well with earlier and later movies, which is common with this series, but perhaps could be explained by the creation of two timelines in The Days of Future Past. If you are planning on watching the series through I would recommend researching what movies belong to the two timelines to watch with more cohesiveness."
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,audience,"I thought it was a good story overall, and a new twist, as we go way back in time to the Egyptians and the first mutant or God that is awakened once again to tangle with some new Mutant characters in saving the world. Can't wait for the next installment"
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,audience,"Creo que es una película buena que llego muy tarde un par de años mas adelante y hubiera sido un exitazo al igual que x men primera generación, creo que le falto una caracterización mas fuerte al villano apocalipsis pero aun así se sintió una amenaza gran parte del tiempo la película esta cargada de momentos épicos y guiños ocultos a series y comics recomendable."
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,audience,Makes me wish a real apocalypse would heppen while watching this garbage.
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,audience,I liked this movie because the action was great but the Phoenix shouldn't be in the movie.
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,audience,Enjoyed it. well made. gripping and didnt feel as long as it was!
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,audience,"Apocalypse is a frustrating movie for me. On one hand, the action sequences are really well handled especially the final battle and the Wolverine and Quicksilver scene. They are very creative and very fun and there's some great worldbuilding in this movie with the origins of Apocalypse and combine that with colorful visuals, it's very interesting to see, everyone gives their A-Game performance-wise, it was awesome seeing a young Jean, Storm and Cyclops and this is by far the best Magneto. He's written so well here. On the other hand, Apocalypse is really poorly handled. He's basically just Ultron but with no screen presence, the first half of the movie is just set up for the final battle and just drags on and on and can be frustrating on rewatches and what happened to the nuclear missiles that were luanched and the plot is kind of disappointing for an X-Men movie, still having the thematic elements you expect but leans more to generic teritory way more than any X-Men movie. It's still a decent movie but could have been a lot better."
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,audience,"Upon first watch I didn't like this movie because it didn't meet my expectation of who Apocalypse is based of the comics and cartoons. He's a large hulking intimidating powerful mutant and his horsemen and just as terrifying. I believe this is most people's reason to not like this movie.  However when watching the movie back to back with X-men: Days of Future Past (the best of the entire film series), this movie is actually pretty good and holds to the characters pretty well. Apocalypse is even done pretty well when you get past the lack of stature and his voice. Apocalypse was one of the first mutants and the fact that he can transfer his essence from one mutant body to another, gaining the new mutant ability while retaining his other abilities and extending his lifespan, makes him a very interesting character. Basically that means this Apocalypse is not the final form of Apocalypse which is enjoyed in the comics and the cartoons."
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,audience,Just not very good at all.
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,audience,"Oof, that was Rotten. Such a bad movie. Wasted apocalypse."
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
It wasn't terrible, and I don't think it entirely deserves its dismal 47 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But it should serve as a wake-up call regarding the franchise's future direction.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
Transcends the law of diminishing rewards by upping the action.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
The special effects are fast, frequent, and generally overwhelming; they look stunning, for the most part, but their sheen wears off when 99% of the imagery is CG.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
I can't help but think it's a film that would disappoint Apocalypse. We all know what happens when Apocalypse gets disappointed.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
All of the characters in this movie had really good personality.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
I really think they do a good job of making it silly and schlocky and serious and fun and action-packed.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
Singer directed the pretty okay X-Men: Days of Future Past in 2014. Now he's returned with X-Men: Apocalypse, and it almost seems like he's trying to destroy the genre that he helped create.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
...the parts that director Bryan Singer gets right-be they heart-wrenching flashbacks or mind-blowing visuals-are what really saves the day.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
Feels like a warmed-over version of what worked better 16 years ago.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
The end result is a fun though chronologically and visually chaotic instalment, which fails to match the brilliance of Singer's previous features.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
It's definitely the weakest of the latest trilogy of ""X-Men"" movies (2011's ""First Class"" and 2014's ""Days of Future Past""). Unless you're Michael Fassbender or James McAvoy, big talent is pretty squandered in the film.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
It's a blockbuster that's also a head scratcher.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
This is an entry in the mutant saga that grows better with successive viewings and even manages to sneak some under the radar performances that stand out. If you remember disliking this movie, I highly suggest you give it another go.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
This outing just had no heart, no zing -- the story both dull and derivative.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
There are no flashbacks that show their origin or clarify their motivations, there is no evolution, Apocalypse is a flat and boring villain, with bad dialogue and a Power Rangers' characterization. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
...that quirky ambition is all but vacant, leaving an underwhelming run of the mill actioner audiences might have settled for in 2003. There are too many films in this hyper specific subgenre being released every year to rest on laurels like this.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
There are some issues, even forgiving a loose plot that doesn't do much character work. I mean, I've read the comics, and I still don't understand what Apocalypse's powers are. He can...dissolve stuff? Make people get swallowed into walls? Who knows?
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
""Everyone knows the third one is always the worst,"" a young Jean Grey ironically reports. X-Men: Apocalypse proves Jean Grey's point.
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
X-Men: Apocalypse may not be the satisfying third film in the series that one would like but it certainly does the job...
 "
X-Men: Apocalypse,47,65,critic,"
It doesn't tell us or show us anything new - it doesn't bring anything to the franchise.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,audience,Seems the only movies Jeff Goldblum can make anymore are weak sequels to his 20 year old films. Guess he needs to work no matter what crap it is for the pay check. To bad he was ok in his day.
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,audience,"An absolute tire fire of a film. An embarrassing effort by the writers, director, on down to the actors. It replicates none of the great moments of the original and tarnishes the nostalgia. "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,audience,"This sloppy mess of poor acting, exposition dumps and bad CGI fails to recapture any of the magic that made the first film so great. This will leave you wishing an alien spaceship was coming to destroy the planet"
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,audience,"Fans of the first movie who waited 20 years for this will be sorely disappointed. The movie does boast spectacular special effects and fight scenes - but it loses much of the charm of the original. The characters are wooden and cliched with Jeff Goldblum the only exception. Despite compelling world building this movie is essentially a reboot - ironically they tease the prospect of a third movie near the end with the humans leading a resistance against the aliens on a sanctuary world - you can't help but feel this is the movie that should have been made. Nevertheless as a big, dumb, summer action movie, it's popcorn for the eyes and worth a watch."
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,audience,The worst film that has ever been made. Avoid at all costs.
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,audience,"Just about everything felt wrong.  Laughingly bad, although I do not think that was the intent.  Too bad, the first movie was soooo good.  Wish I knew how to give 0 stars, because the half of one out of five feels overly generous."
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,audience,"While this sequel may lack the offensive (and absurd) ""America first"" political undertones of its predecessor, and it has a worthy young cast, it still sucks. At least the original had Will Smith."
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,audience,"WTF show is this!!! 
Did Roland Emmerich had someone else directed Independence Day? 

Is there no art in directing movies now?
Any amateur can direct a better movie with 165million than this. This is like anything goes movie, just put everything in. 
Worst 2hr of my life spent ever!! 
I'm pissed this show is profitable.. 

I just create an account to comment on how shit bad this is."
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,audience,"Special effects is good and cast is ok, but the plot is boring and dumb. it tries too hard to replicate the original and failed. Overall very mediocre"
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,audience,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I give it a negative 1000 compared to the first movie. It is absolutely unwatchable.
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
It's been 20 years in the making, but it's 19 years too late.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
Resurgence is a movie that tries too hard to recapture the natural aspects of it's predecessor while trying to introduce new plot elements that you hope that can be figured out in future movies.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
As absurd as it is stupid, Independence Day: Resurgence is a movie that will go down as a reviled and needless. But it's also goofy and has the sense of a small, petulant child banging his toys together in a sandbox, which is amusing.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
A fun time to disconnect your brain. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
This was even dumber, if possible.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
I had a lot of fun in this movie.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
There were five writers listed on this thing, and when the Save the Cat outline says to save a cat, they literally saved a cat.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
""Resurgence"" is not better than its predecessor, and I don't think it will ever come to play repeatedly on television on July Fourth like ""Independence Day.""
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
The sequel does not fool anyone, pretends to be pure entertainment, but is so idiot that it is hard to be entertained by it. [Full Review in Spanish]
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
ndependence Day: Resurgence is expectedly dumb but surprisingly ugly, with computer-generated chaos replacing anything resembling comprehendible action. Apparently, it took five writers to come up with ""but what if everything was bigger?""
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
If you own the first Independence Day, I suggest buying this one so you have both in your collection, but, as a stand-alone, it doesn't excite as much as the original.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
There are so many awesome things in this movie, but they're executed so poorly that you love them and you hate them at the same time.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
Like a blockbuster machine, Emmerich spits out explosions and poor dialogue at his most absurd rate yet.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
It really feels like nobody even tried to make a good movie.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
Watch it for the VFX and for a few good light-hearted moments that will make the movie more real. Watch this one for the whole 20-years-ago-and-now nostalgia.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
Proves to be nothing more than a lazy attempt to recapture the magic of the original. It comes off as a second-rate rip-off that lacks any of the fun or imagination as its predecessor.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
It all becomes a little bit much after awhile.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
Independence Day: Resurgence is an outdated product stuck in a decade that we've long since moved past.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
A lazy, shallow exercise in summer sequel escapism that doubles down on all the mistakes of its predecessor.
 "
Independence Day: Resurgence,30,30,critic,"
If the safe blandness of Independence Day: Resurgence is any indicator of the quality for the inevitable sequel, I hope the aliens win next time.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,audience,"It was obvious this movie wasn't on track to be good from the start, but when Will Smith said, ""What are we, some kind of Suicide Squad?"" I truly realized how much of a dumpster fire I was in for."
Suicide Squad,26,59,audience,Awesome action and good story line
Suicide Squad,26,59,audience,"Christ, this movie is such a mess. It's a train wreck of lackluster filmmaking, gimmicky studio meddling, and poor direction that has aged like cotton candy-colored rotten milk. It overcompensates with a flashy gimmicky presentation in the first 20 minutes jingling colorful text screens and pop songs like jingling keys in front of a baby. It almost lures out into  false sense of fun until it pulls back the carpet and reveals its rotten core of obnoxious characters that you don't care about fighting in badly lit sets stumbling rom one checkpoint to another in a confusing mess of a story that's filled with more holes than a block of swiss cheese. Occasionally there is a mildly fun action moment or legitimately funny joke, but they're far and few between. Some of the makeup, costuming, and acting is decent too, but it's not enough to save this mess of a comic book movie."
Suicide Squad,26,59,audience,"Poorly developed characters, script flaws ... but it's still a good movie with a Harlequin who steals the show whenever she appears"
Suicide Squad,26,59,audience,Um filme bonito é com personagens carismáticos.
Suicide Squad,26,59,audience,"The script is bad and the storyline just doesn't make any sense.  Why make a team of bad guys when you can call actual superheroes like the X-Men?!? 
Here's a list of things to fix in this god-awful movie:
1. Fix the characters
2. Fix the setting
3. Fix the script
4. Fix the title
5. And Finally fix the CGI 
If you follow these steps you will get a good movie OK"
Suicide Squad,26,59,audience,2/14/21 I don’t know why the bad reviews. I liked the characters. I liked the action. I was entertained. Worthy rewatch someday.
Suicide Squad,26,59,audience,This movie could have been so much more with the awesome cast it had. 
Suicide Squad,26,59,audience,"This movie had great potential but lacked an interesting story, exiting action and humor. Waste of time."
Suicide Squad,26,59,audience,"So disappointed with liberal writers doing action films. Stick to transgender feel-good flicks, you DONT know guns, or the Military, You despise them and it shows through your shite writing."
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
Taken at face value, Suicide Squad is an argument for recruiting fascist scum to fight in America's wars overseas and, presumably, at home. Anything goes in the fight against ""terrorism.""
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
DC Comics' latest addition to their burgeoning cinematic universe fails in several rather spectacular ways.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
Suicide Squad had a lot of potential to be something different and exciting in the very familiar superhero movie genre. Instead, it's just another incoherent mess...
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
It's baffling that this movie struggled with its storyline to such a distressing degree.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
We loved how the entire film had a very recent and modern-day feel to it, especially in the choice of clothing and slang...
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
Suicide Squad falls remarkably short.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
Once again, DC has made a film that feels less original and more like they're just mimicking what they see Marvel doing. Its tone is all over the place and we aren't given enough time to get to know the characters so we can care about their fates.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
DC seems to be confused in what tone to choose in their recent movies. Suicide Squad would have benefited from a ""R"" rating uptick.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
Suicide Squad may look like candy, and it's not entirely sour, but that doesn't make it sweet.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
Suicide Squad [has] a lot more bright spots than its reputation leads you to believe.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
It is truly disrespectful to the viewer that a superhero movie as stupid as Suicide Squad is shown in the movie theaters. [Full review in Spanish]
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
The movie is a series of introductions that last about half an hour and then it's the third act.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
This movie is terrible.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
Instead of embracing 75 years of iconic characters and their world, we have a studio that erratically uses concepts and then changes them arbitrarily.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
Unfortunately, what's advertised as high-octane rock n' roll is more of an uneven pop song.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
You may enjoy it if you are familiar with the comics and therefore don't need the context that would normally be required. But for the rest of us, it's one of the biggest disappointments of the year...
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
First things first, it's a mess. Ranging from the unconvincing script to the plot with more holes than a sieve, there's very little to form a solid foundation for a strong super/antihero team.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
There are so many side characters in ""Suicide Squad"" that character development falls by the wayside unless you're one of the big players, primarily Harley Quinn and Deadshot.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
This inaugural episode of a new DC Comics franchise is more tease than satisfying action blockbuster.
 "
Suicide Squad,26,59,critic,"
Suicide Squad is great nihilistic fun.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,audience,"not  alot  of music

a lot of  good characters
good for  all ages
its  educational"
Finding Dory,94,84,audience,This terrible movie deserves to be at 50-60%
Finding Dory,94,84,audience,"While it's nowhere near the magic of the original, Finding Dory is still a charming (albeit mostly safe) fun ride with a heartfelt message of empathizing with and empowering individuals born with disabilities. Dory's relationship with her parents in particular is really sweet. The new characters are charismatic in their own rights too. Unfortunately, Marlin and Nemo have been relegated to the sidelines with very little to do. But to be fair, their story arcs were already completed by the end of the original movie and admittedly this movie's focus is undoubtedly Dory's story to tell. Though I have to say, the climax is incredibly stupid and almost goes against the message of wildlife rehabilitation. But on the upside, the ending that follows it with Dory's reuniting with her parents certainly more than makes up for this. Not necessarily a Pixar classic, but certainly one worth your time."
Finding Dory,94,84,audience,This is a good sequel to finding Nemo I really don't understand the hate makes no since to me but kinda wanted the parents of dory a little bit more story the only problem I have
Finding Dory,94,84,audience,This was trying to be my favorite Pixar movie and it didn’t make the picture
Finding Dory,94,84,audience,This emotional roller coaster will bring tears and laughs to you.
Finding Dory,94,84,audience,"It was okay, not the best, not the worst, not super memorable, but a decent fish-flick to pass the time."
Finding Dory,94,84,audience,"It's not a bad film, but it's inferior to the original on every level. Dory is a nice side character, not the lead. She is too annoying to have that much focus. The plot was murky at times and the film just wasn't as interesting or enjoyable as the first. I did enjoy the addition of Hank the Octopus. Point for some more spectacular animation as well"
Finding Dory,94,84,audience,I was worried that Dory as the protagonist wouldn't work so well... but it did! The storyline involving her parents was v emotional and had me balling my eyes out. The action sequences towards the end are a bit silly - that's my only criticism. It's a terrific film
Finding Dory,94,84,audience,Great film but compared to other Pixar films it's a bit dissapointing
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
With kaleidoscopic animation, powerfulstorytelling, and a masterclass of voice actors, this sequel surpasses expectations and shoots straight to the top.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
For a film set in the ocean, it somehow even manages to throw in a car chase sequence.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
Filled to the brim with entertaining action sequences, slapstick humor, and the infinite heart and honesty that we have come to expect from Pixar's best films.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
It's adorable and hilarious... but I wish it had taken more of a stand on things.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
It was not a bad sequel, which is nice.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
And if you haven't fallen in love with the most forgetful fish in the ocean, you will now.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
The Pixar animation masters have created another visual feast, with images and effects not even contemplated in 2003. Had Finding Dory come from any other group of artists, perhaps I would have judged it a success. But Pixar I hold to a higher standard.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
While it lacks the tight narrative structure of Pixar's most ambitious efforts, it is a beautiful, charming and funny film.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
Swimmingly sensational!
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
Funnier than the original... The movie takes an odd over-the-top turn in its final minutes that feels like it would have been better suited in an animated Disney TV series.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
Even though we didn't find it necessary to break out the hankies for this one there are lots of laughs, particularly in the first half of the film.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
The dip back into the flow of some of Pixar's best work building a world has its rewards.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
Nourishing in ways I could never have imagined, Finding Dory is a simple storytelling delight...
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
Pleasant, endearing and possessed of enough charm to make you overlook its lack of originality, the film is about as much as you could hope for from such a calculated follow-up. Sadly and honestly, even now, I don't know if that's a compliment.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
Efforts like Finding Dory do little to quell the feeling that a certain measure of rubber-stamp efficiency has gripped the studio (the superb Inside Out excepted). In other words, welcome to Pixar's cash-grab years.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
What Finding Dory does is take the Pixar formula and deliver exactly what you want to see from a Pixar movie.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
Finding Dory is stunningly beautiful.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
Disability - or really, any kind of minor impairment - is rarely featured in mainstream cinema, and Finding Dory is at its strongest when exploring these uncharted waters.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
It's a typically excellent offering from the studio, filled with big laughs and bigger feelings.
 "
Finding Dory,94,84,critic,"
Finding Dory is a sweet tale that will have audiences cheering our blue friend on as she ""just keeps swimming.""
